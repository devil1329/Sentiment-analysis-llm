airport hotel ,"Not as bad as I expected If you compare this hotel to American standards, then yes I guess I would say this isn't the best place to stay for the money. But in comparison to India standards it wasn't all that bad. Maybe I just lucked out. The location was perfect in relation to the airport (domestic and international terminals). My bathroom was clean so was my bedding, the staff was responsive. I did order room service which wasn't to good, the menu was strictly vegetarian and over priced. I got much better quality and tasting food from the Shangra Lai hotel in Delhi for a little bit more money. Would I stay here again for a night...yes. I probably wouldn't for more than one night though. "
airport hotel ,"Don't stay !! Wrote a mail and got reservation which included airport pick-up. No car waited. Took pre-paid taxi to the hotel, At the reception no reservation, 5 (!) people took care of us, no one said something about the mail-although I got answers from them. Gave us rooms at higher price than reserved.Later, at home, saw another mail form this hotel promising a discount on their rates which they didn't give when we checked-in.The hotel was under renovation, losts of dust, noisy working until late. Rooms dirty, sheets filthy, obvious not changed since the last guests. But at my request, new sheets were brought. Got taxi back to the airport, and they even gave us a wake-up call.All in all, not worth the money . "
airport hotel ,"Better stay at Airport Due to unavailability in star hotels was compelled to stay in this hotel for my transit flight.Pros :Staff was good.Airport pickup and dropCons:1.Dirty Rooms.2.Mosquitoes, all varieties of insects.3.Even after 20 hrs of flight journey chose to stay awake was not feeling secure.It would have been better if I would have stayed in the transit lounge at the ariport. "
airport hotel ,"My worst hotel experience ever! I had to stay one night near the Delhi airport while waiting for a connecting flight... I now know I should have spent the night at the airport instead! The room was really dirty and smelly, the bed was horrendous - the linen was so dirty, smelly and spotty that it was obvious that the linen had not been washed for ages. The towels, apparently formerly white, were brownish gray and contained samples such as hair and toothpaste from previous unlucky visitors. The shower offered cold water only and there was no sign of the internet connection which was promised at the time of booking. Over 100 euros for this crap is the worst rip-off ever - never has the price and the quality of a hotel room been so far apart! There were far more staff in the hotel than guests and all of the staff were of course waiting to be tipped (and sweared at you if you didn't) - as if the 100 euro room price was not enough for this &quot;quality&quot;! Do yourself a favour and never step into this craphole... "
airport hotel ,very poor do not stay here we decided to stay here for one night during a layover at the airport on our way back from nepal. On our outwards journey we stayed at the hotel clarke international which was amazing includidng an awesome meal too.we booked The airport hotel because we had an early morning flight and wanted to be near the hotel. After a breif web serch we decided to book airport hotel the website gave the impression or a professionally run establishment.On arrival we found the reception staff to be rude and very unhelpful. We had a late flight so we had no indian rupees to pay the bill with. They would not except us dollars or any foreign currency (weird for an airport hotel) instead I was told I would be taken to the airport to change money. in the end I was given directions on how to walk to the airport for currency exchange. Once in our room we found it disgusting I wanted to leave but we had no other options and we were on an early morning flight the next day so we decided to grin and bear it.The sight of the room still makes me want to be sick. dirty peeled wall papper. A smelly dirty bathroom. with no hot water dirty carpet and a dirty bed. with the location of the airport there were not restaurants nearby so we had to eat in the hotel restaurant. The hotel webstie proudly boasts cuisine from around the world. what the website didnot say was expensive poor vegitairian indian food. by now I just wanted to get drunk and fall asleep to end the misery. I was told by the reception I would hve to walk to the shop to buy beer the hotel did not sell beer.We were then told breakfast was part of our room package. when we went for breakfast in the morining we told we would have to pay. I dedcide to check out and that I would rather sit in delhi airport?when leaving the room we were harassed by 3 differnt members of staff for our room key so they could check our mini bar.I would not wish this place on my worst enermy please please please do not give these people your hard earned money 
airport hotel ,"Not Recommended Because of a unexpected layover at the Delhi Airport, it was necessay to get a quick room, which ended up being spur of the moment at the Airport Hotel Delhi. It is very close to the Delhi Airport, but the room was very basic, the shower didn't work, and it was noisy.The service was actually the best part of the overnight stay. I managed to order some coffee and toast in a pinch very early in the morning before flying out.This hotel should be used a emergency stays only, but not recommended.Watch out for very overpriced cabs that are stationed outside at the Delhi Airport. Use the pre-paid cab service from inside the terminal. "
airport hotel ,"Stay Away!!!!!! Had to transit via Delhi on my way to Surat (Gujarat) and decided to spend the night close to the hotel. Worst decision of my life as the hotel was quite possibly the worst hotel that I've ever stayed in India. The bed was awefull, the room dirty and the shower full of mould. There was no proper hot water and the front door wouldnt lock properly. Would highly suggest that you look elsewhere! "
airport hotel ,"Worst hotel ever been High rates, bad rooms, complicated check in "
airport hotel ,Bruyant 
ajanta hotel ,"a decent hotel in an interesting part of Delhi If you are wanting a good basic hotel at a good price offering decent accommodation, inexpensive restaurant, internet access and situate in an old part of the city then the Ajanta does nicely. They offer free transport from the airport (24 hours) which is very handy when you are a first time visitor to India. The onsite Bureau de Change is an added bonus. Street noise can be a slight problem until into the early hours. "
ajanta hotel ,"great hotel true value for money its a great hotel excellent staff very friendly and helpful, rooms were clean n tidy and very close to public transport will go back to same hotel whenever will be visiting delhi again "
ajanta hotel ,"Overpriced- What a Rip Off I stayed at Ajanta with my spouse and another relative earlier this month. The hotel is 15 mins by rickshaw to Connaught Place and is on a very busy and interesting street. We booked the family room and were quite astonished that the actual room was nothing like the pics on the hotel website.Those pictures are misleading. We were put in a ugly windowless room which is not up to international standards at all. The bathroom was not impressive also. The night when our relative arrived to join us, we were taken by the Ajanta staff to a hotel at the back of Ajanta and told that we needed to check in again. This was quite confusing and uncalled for. We had to be rude and grab our bags back and walk back to Ajanta''s front building.Like previous travellers who commented on this hotel, we were also offered tour packages. We were told that the price for just a driver from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur and back to Delhi would be £220 for 3 persons. Luckily we decided to visit the Incredible Travel Centre Office in Connaught Place before making any decisions and were shocked to be offered a package of £160 per person for a week trip to Delhi,Agra, Jaipur and Pushkar. This price included all hotels, taxes,driver, breakfast etc. We immediately accepted and checked out of Ajanta the next day never to return for the duration of our trip and I dont think ever to return again. Probably the best thing about this hotel is the restaurant which serves good food;yet it was very pricy compared to other hotel restaurants which had higher standards with cheaper but good food.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . The staff whould also try to make the atmosphere at the hotel relaxed. We felt uncomfortable every time we came to he reception area because staff seemed so distant and unfriendly. "
ajanta hotel ,value for money good. user friendly clean hotel. rooms need to be more airy. 
ajanta hotel ,"Don't stay here Don't stay here. They constantly wanted to sell us tours etc even when we had said that we preferred to make our own plans. My husband was using the internet and was looking at a hotel in another city, when one of the staff came up behind him said &quot;that place has no running water&quot; which was completely untrue, we stayed there and it was beautiful, plenty of running water, clearly the hotel gets a commission from sending people to other hotels which did not include this one and they are prepared to lie to you.. I also had the misfortune to leave my mobile phone in the room when we went away for a day. Luckily I got it back but a call had been made to a number I did not recognise. One day one of the staff knocked on our door saying that we should have checked out by now when we had already pre paid for that night and the following night so they were very disorganised as well. I have never posted a negative review before but I think people need to know what they are getting in for when they stay here. I could go on and on with bad points about this place... "
ajanta hotel ,"Require improvement Positives:- Close to New Delhi railway station- Above average restaurant. Good value prices. (For dinner only)- Air conditioning works- Service OK. Didn't have much trouble with the tour manager.Negatives:- Website photos are misleading. There were no proper windows in my deluxe room.- Sheets provided not particularly clean- Bathroom not clean (see photos attached), cracks on the bathroom wall- Lift wasn't working on day 2- No hot waterConclusion I paid around INR 3000 per night for a deluxe room, it just didn't feel right. Should have paid less for a budget hotel, or pay more at a quality hotel. "
ajanta hotel ,Good hotel in not so good area The pickup from the station was rather badly organised - 1 car for seven people so we had to wait for a second car! Hotel is in the Para gang area of Delhi - not all taxi's rickshaws will go to the area! This is ok as long as you know in advance. But the area is being redeveloped - it had changed enormously in 2 years so this may change.The deluxe rooms are good - large clean and well equiped - but it is rather noisey. The staff are helpful. Breakfast is not included and the attached resturant is slow. 
ajanta hotel ,"Get a Rough Guide to India or Read the Trip Advisor We started our journey at 4.00am on friday morning...at arrival to New Dehli, plane was delayed an hour....driver was waiting...no problems....reached the hotel at approximately 2.10am - we all were shipped into a small room to check in and also payments for our stay was requested immediately...after sending a number of e-mails for explainations on the rates a price was agreed however we were overcharged - okay payments were made without arguments - we finally went to sleep at 3.30am....my 14year old son was exhausted - next morning at 9.45am - phone rang - office manager wanted to know how we were.....at this point we felt we had to get up and go down. ..10.30am we went downstairs - we hadnt even reached the final step when the office manager greeted us and took us straight into her office to discuss our interniary and what our plans were...at this point, we were still jet-lagged, my son wasnt feeling very well - he also was hungry as well - none of this was taken into consideration...we were bombarded with questions - we had to tell her we need to think about what we want to do - if we asked any questions she would reply and then say I told you so or I have already told you - which confused us more - the service in the breakfast area was very poor - no one explained what breakfast was available....we didnt like Ajanta at all and wouldnt recommend it to anyone - we stayed at a reputable Hotel in Mumbai and the same brand hotel was only x2 doors way, if I had know, I would have rather spent my hard earned money there than Ajanta...we went to Ajanta because of the Lonely Planet reviews however, we felt, because, perhaps we were Indians, we were been exploited in the hotel as well as out...the manager told us not to trust anyone outside yet we felt we couldnt trust anyone in or out...rather take out chances out then in the hotel..we stayed at a number of other different hotels in India and Ajanta was the worst....it was all money, money money, I am in the process of writing a complaint letter to Ajanta Hotel ..I am not expecting a reply...they have our money....they dont need to reply.... "
ajanta hotel ,"This hotel is NOT safe for single females! At the beginning of October my sister, a single female traveller about to arrive in India, called this hotel on two occasions from the UK and requested a room booking for the night of her arrival in Delhi. She spoke to two separate members of staff, both of whom assured her that a room had been reserved for her. She then followed this up with an email to the hotel. She requested an airport pick up, gave her flight details and was assured also that this had been arranged.On arrival at the airport in the early hours of the morning, she found no-one from the hotel waiting to pick her up. On telephoning your hotel to ask about the transfer, she was told that her room had been given away to a party of guests who had arrived and requested a five day stay. The person she spoke to seemed to think it was perfectly reasonable not to honour her reservation merely because a more lucrative booking had presented itself.My sister was thus stranded, alone, in Delhi, in the middle of the night. She was taken to an office of touts by a taxi driver, who forced her to pay a very high price for a five-hour taxi transfer to Rishikesh.I wrote to the hotel and asked for an explanation but no reply has been received. I therefore do not suggest that you stay at this hotel, as it doesn't seem to value customer service or reliability at all. "
ajanta hotel ,"excellent value for money well run hotel, nice and clean rooms, excellent restaurant, reasonable prices, good location close to New Delhi railway station, its really worth the money.We will chose it again and also recommend it to our friends. "
ajanta hotel ,"the hotel does not honour its commitment We reserved luxory rooms 4 weeks before arrival, but they didnt have such rooms for us. Other hotels nearby give same kind of rooms and service for half of the price. "
ajanta hotel ,Good hotel-great location I travelled to Goa and Agra this year and must say India Rocks. We landed in New Delhi and stayed at Hotel Ajanta. What a great location! Right in the heart of the city. We walked to Connaught Palace-the downtown of Delhi on several occassions. The Hotel on its own was so self sufficient. Room service was good. I personally enjoyed the chicken dish at the Hotel's Restaraunt. The driver of the hotel cab that we took to Agra was friendly and knew a lot about Agra. The Taj mahal was awesome. 
ajanta hotel ,"terrible hotel high price room dirty and old, water stops, very high price.not recommand "
ajanta hotel ,"Typical Indian exuberance outside helpful staff peace and quiet inside: best of both worlds I stayed in the Ajanta Hotel in Delhi for several weeks in 2006/2007. It was an unusually enjoyable experience. The hotel is close to New Delhi station, where the special ticket office for tourists is located, and to Main Bazaar, a huge shopping district where everything under the sun can be had. The Ajanta Hotel is in a street which is teeming with typical Indian life, something that genuine travellers usually want to experience, while at the same time offering an oasis of quiet, order and cleanliness, which Westerners also often want in order to recover from the usual Indian exuberance and noise. Staying there therefore gives you the best of both worlds: Indian life and divine chaos on your doorstep, and safety and quiet inside.You could not have the same experience if you stayed in one of the super-expensive luxury hotels, which are located in areas and enclaves which are &quot;sanitised&quot; to such an extent, that no ordinary Indian is allowed in (&quot;no Indian life is here&quot;), and where you might as well be in a similar hotel in New York or London. Apart from the general cleanliness, which is a feature worth stressing in all hotels which do not charge the earth, I found the staff extraordinarily friendly and helpful. This is true of all their reception staff, who soon know you by name, and of the people providing various services, like the cyber café (where the guy in charge went to great lengths to be helpful.Wonderful staff is there to give you advice on anything under the sun: how best to travel to various parts of Delhi, how to avoid being overcharged by taxi drivers, where best to go to for buying specific items, how to cope with the language, and how to solve any other problems you might have. I was impressed by one woman in particular: Take one look at her and you know you can trust her - unlike the many crooks and spivs with whom the tourist is soon surrounded in other parts of Delhi.This is much more than I had the right to expect in any but the most expensive and exclusive hotels. But this one is NOT expensive and NOT exclusive. I noticed that it is used by backpackers, by business people and ordinary tourists alike, young and old, from all nations under the sun, and they all seem to be happy together.The charges are very reasonable by Western standards and for the comfort that is on offer.There is also a restaurant in which splendid cuisine is on provided and which is frequented not only by hotel guests but also attracts people from other parts of Delhi.I am very grateful for having been allowed to stay there and was lucky to have, by sheer accident, discovered this hotel in the first place. I hope these wonderful people, staff and leaders alike, will continue to prosper.Klaus BungBlackburn, UKw: http://tinyurl.com/prtd5ce: klaus@rtc-money.co.uk "
ajanta hotel ,Feeling very safe as a women travelling alone This hotel makes you feel very safe in a big city as Delhi is. The pickingup from the airport is reliable and very fast and comfortable. Rooms are big and clean. The best you can get for little money! 
ajanta hotel ,"amazingly friendly and helpful staff a greta value hotel we stayed at this hotel 5 times during our 6 week holiday to india, it was a perfect stop off when travelling accross the country and was such good value for money that it made sense. You can be guaranteed a clean and quiet room for the night and a superb dinner in the restaurant (although give breakfast a miss). Mrs Ravi in particular was a great help when organising trips to rajistan and she also helped when I had a an ear infection. "
ajanta hotel ,"Terrible hotel One of the worst hotels i ever stayed in, don't even know where to begin..First they couldn't find my reservation so they put me in a room on ground floorfrom where you can hear people on the street screaming while you are taking a showercause window can't be closed.After when i asked about some restaurants and shopping places, people from hotel saidnothing of that is working but they know very fine place to eat.. Probably some comission deal.I can go on and on... "
ajanta hotel ,"2ND worst hotel I stayed in I went to India for 2 weeks in Sept. Traveled to Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Jaipur, Jaipur, Agra and Delhi. HOTEL AJANTA WAS THE 2ND WORST HOTEL I STAYED IN! (the winner was Hotel Sheila in Agra)The room charges are excessive for what you actually get. The hotel charge for every little thing i.e. internet access, breakfast etc (almost all hotels i stayed in offer this and more complimentary).The pre-paid taxi is overpriced, the tours they offer is overpriced and they insist on only taking you on the tourist trail i.e. where they want you to go (and this always includes the tourist handicraft shops).The photo's on their website is nothing like what you get. The rooms are dull, most have no windows, some spit stains on the wall.I travel to India twice a year and have been doing so for around 4 years now, my experience is the good hotels won't take payment until you check out; whereas the poor ones always as for full payment in advance (this hotel asks for payment in advance).My advice would be to skip this hotel and pick one of the 20 hotels on the same road. I believe as Hotel Ajanta are in all the guide books their standards have slipped considerably and feel they no longer have to go that extra mile for their guests. "
ajanta hotel ,"Not worth the room rates charged Stayed here for 2 nights. It was not a very comfortable stay in comparison to the room rates we paid.1) Found the room a bit small -- the double bed occupied the entire space.2) The water pipes were leaking in the bathroom3) The room key did not work one afternoon. So we were stuck outside our room for almost an hour while the carpenter tried to get the door open.4) While checking out, the credit card machine was not working. My husband ran around for 30 minutes in search of an ATM and we paid by cash. So I would suggest others to have enough cash handy during checkout.Good points:1) The drivers associated with the hotel are polite and friendly.2) Near the New Delhi railway station "
ajanta hotel ,"Good comfortable choice for Paharganj We stayed in a family room (2 adults and 2 kids) and a junior suite (2 adults). A friend of ours checked out all mid-range hotels in the area (in advance) and picked this one for its cleanliness and space. The family room was reasonable. It was a good size with 2 double beds (one of them circular which the kids loved), although without any windows it was a bit musty. The bathroom was OK - about what you would expect from a budget place (clean but old). The junior suite was done nicely with effort made and a better bathroom. The best part about it was it opened out onto a terrace which was great for enjoying a drink in the evening. Our main complaint was that there is a switch for the electricity outside the bedroom and someone came and switch off both rooms in the middle of the night (i.e., so we woke up with no fan / AC and hot!). Overall, Ajanta Hotel is a good choice for this area of Delhi. Just beware that despite its proximity to the railway station it can still take quite a while if you get stuck in traffic! "
ajanta hotel ,"An oasis in Delhi! For those travelling in a mid-range or budget scheme, the Ajanta is a wonderful suitable option combining reasonable prices with good services regarding to food, connectivity, security and travel assistance - look for Mr Manik at the travel desk! - "
ajanta hotel ,"Very nice hotel and helpful staf I stayed 6 nights at Ajanta and had a very nice stay. The staff was very helpful and even helped me with Indian simcard to my mobile. The pictures on websites are better than in real, but ex deluxroom are very nice.Arrangement made by the travel agency City capital was excellent.Next time, if there is any, I definitive will stay at Ajanta.Jörgen KjellgrenGothenburg, Sweden "
ajanta hotel ,"Comfortable first stop in India airport pickup a welcomed start We stayed 10 nights. We booked the accommodation through an online agent with a special offer for airport pickup. Our flight arrived in New Delhi at 3am, and sure enough, the driver was waiting for us with a clearly marked sign. It was a pleasant drive in and made for a good start. Upon arrival and check in we were offered a cup of tea - nice touch. Our room was a semi deluxe, with a large bathroom. Staff were friendly. Guest needs to initiate requests. The hotel is located within walking distance of the New Delhi train station and there are some eating places along the street as well as a hotel restaurant - we suggest the vegetarian meals. "
ajanta hotel ,"My Trusted Hotel since 2000 was back for the 4rth time had a blast in delhi and great 2 days at your place,many diferent people new rooftop nice suite rooms and thanks for giving our upgrade ,my wife and I appreciated every thing the hotel and staff did for us,will be back next year same time .Special thanks to the reception staff for helping us book our flights and tickets onwards. "
ajanta hotel ,"Dishonest staff and misleading photos on website!! Pretty appalling. Tours salesman pretty nasty and especially so when he found out we booked tours with someone else (better at half the price - try the Tourist Info centre in Connaught Place area - it should be marked on any tourist map - ask for Mustafa). BEWARE - this has a &quot;sister&quot; hotel, The Hotel Delhi City Centre . We originally booked there after looking at the photos on the internet, but the photos were of the Ajanta. The Hotel City Delhi City Centre was a real dump, nothing like the photos and when I challenged the staff they lied to my face several times. I had a look round and had to threaten to leave to get them to move us to the Ajanta. In summary, it's a cheap hotel and we eventually got what we paid for after pushing pretty hard (I'm 6'2&quot; and don't take any crap, so I don't know what they would be like with less assertive people), i.e. fairly clean but quite shabby rooms, noisy aircon etc. My advice is DON'T buy tours there, DON'T touch the mini bar (especially the water) and don't expect too much after seeing the website photos of the rooms!! "
ajanta hotel ,"Not welcoming and first impressions last...... We booked at Hotel Ajanta prior to arrival in India, it had mixed reviews but so did most of the Hotels in Delhi. A plus point for us was the free airport pick-up (which was fine). We got to the Hotel at about 5am after many hours travelling. The staff were unfriendly and after filling out the forms (which we felt they could have done later) they wanted payment up front. When we produced Rupees they wanted to know where we got them from, how much was the rate and if we had the receipt. We pretended we couldn't find the receipt and were a bit shocked at how in our face they had been about it. The room was semi-clean, and it had toilet paper etc, but no hot water. We also had no window in the room, except into the corridor.The worst part of the Hotel was the tour manager at the office downstairs; very pushy and in your face every time we walked in and out of the Hotel. We nearly took one of their tours (naivety showing through) until we met up with a friend (of a friend) in Delhi who told us that the Hotel had been in the papers recently for scamming tourists with the tours.We checked out of the Hotel early in the end, and would not recommend it to anyone. There are much better places to stay, where you don't feel like your are being questioned and under surveillance. "
ajanta hotel ,Try another one.. Ok the price and pick up service attracts you at first but.....The room was too noisy I thought I was sleeping on the street and you will not find the rooms like the photos on website..Restaurant was terrible. They say not available for everything in the menu except rice and some Indian stuff..Breakfast is so called open buffet but there was nothing at all and you can not order anything else if you need..And do not ever think about arranging a trip with them they literally conned me. When I understood it was too late and they did not even reply my emails.I paid 12000 rupees for a trip which costs maximum 8000 rupees.And they demand for cash. The cashier guy told me that &quot;this is too small money give it in cash&quot; I think India became rich..So I would not recommend to anyone.. 
ajanta hotel ,"Decent Hotel I was a little bit suspicious of Hotel Ajanta, based on some of the reviews on here. However, the hotel was perfectly fine to use as a base to explore Delhi. It was generally clean, the rooms were a decent size and the shower was warm, albeit a little temperamental. The complimentary hotel pickup was very good. The first room we were given was a bit cell like as it was small, had no window and the bathroom looked a bit grubby but after asking, the staff were happy to move us to the slightly bigger room next door where there was a window and a better bathroom. The hotel was a bit noisy but what can you expect from the location? Staff were freindly to us, and the lobby etc... was clean. The restaurant was fine too. Some people on this have complained about a &quot;pushy&quot; travel agent at the hotel trying to force you into overpriced tours. When we checked into the hotel we were spoken to by a friendly man in the office about our travel plans, but because we knew what we were doing, he didn't try and sell us anything (though the hotel might want to note that some people on this website have found this approach a bit pushy and unwelcoming.) Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Ajanta and would recommend it as a budget place to stay in Delhi. "
ajanta hotel ,Not a guest friendly hotel Please carry cash at the time of check out (credit card is not accepted in this hotel) else you will have to walk for five minutes to take cash from ATM and pay your bill. 
ajanta hotel ,"Ajanta Hotel was clean and hospitable in an impeccable location. We appreciated our clean, cool room in the hot season, and the friendly, helpful staff. This hotel has a lovely view of the Taj Mahal from the rooftop eating area, and the car and driver we hired to drive to Jaipur and back to Delhi were comfortable and clean. This was an excellent value and we would not hesitate to stay there again. We were a party of three adults traveling together, my husband and me and my sister-in-law. "
ajanta hotel ,"Much improved from the first time I stayed I have stayed at the Hotel Ajanta on 2 occasions, The first was not a good experience however this was maybe because I had not prepared for the differences in lifestyle and other things. I felt pressured to take taxi's everywhere and lost money doing so but I decided to give it another go and returned.This time I found it much easier, the food was very good, the service was excellent and yes the rooms were a bit noisy but its New Delhi!!!I would recommend this hotel as its a really good place to chill out whilst aclimatising to this beautiful country. "
ajanta hotel ,"Ok but I'm sure there are better options for the same price. Our stay at Hotel Ajanta was fine, but the hotel isn't especially nice. The staff were at times a bit rude and also quite pushy to arrange trips/trains/activites for you. The food was ok but the restaurant wasn't a nice place, although one night we ate on the roof and that was better. Our room had everything we needed but wasn't very well kept. The location is quite good, as it is very close to the New Delhi train station. Basically it's fine for a place to sleep and an ok option, but maybe look around for a better option first. "
ajanta hotel ,"Nice rooms noisy location good for a budget hotel We had a really spacious room, but was at the front of the hotel. It had very thin windows, so little sleep was had, as the hotel is located in the 'flea pit'/backpacker area', Pagarhni, of Delhi. The travel agent man within the hotel, is a good saleman and booked us 5 day trip with a driver around Rajasthan. overall a good hotelshort stay, but I wouldn't stay in Delhi too long anyway! "
ajanta hotel ,A good place in the heart of New Delhi A clean and quiet place in heart of New Delhi within walking distance from New Delhi railway station. The bustle outside is not affecting the stay inside the hotel. The rooms are clean and maintained. The restaurant seems to be good though I could not use the same due to my itinerary. The room service is OK but the time taken for service can be improved upon. The hotel offers one free pickup / drop from / to the airport. The hotel is reasonably priced. 
ajanta hotel ,"Nice and safe hotel in Delhi I stayed at Ajanta hotel in several occasions. The staff are friendly and helpful, they help you organize your trips, you get safe taxis, good advice on travel. It has 24 hr room service and hot water. It is a government approved hotel, that means that you are safe in there. The restaurant has good food, you have breakfast buffet, which is very delicious. It is good value for the price. The location is also very convenient, it is very close to New Delhi railway station and to the Paharganj commercial area (you can go by walk) You can take an auto to Connaught place as well and it is quite close. A good and friendly place to stay in Delhi for a good price!! Plenty of foreigners choose this hotel as well. "
ajanta hotel ,"Great experience at an amazing cost Oe has several apprehensions about booking hotels from another city. BUt what I saw on the net is what I experienced on reaching Ajanta Hotel.The ambience and the staff at this hotel - Hotel Ajanta make you feel welcomed and the comfortable stay thereafter is worth mentioning.Highlights would be the cleanliness and the prompt service. After a hard day's work it does make a difference when you enter a good, well kept, clean room. And then when you need something extra, it reaches you promptly. I would be making this review incomplete if I did not mention about their food. Give this place a try. You will come back "
ajanta hotel ,"Excellent Value for Money It is really great value for money hard to explain in words. The staff is very helpful and what to say about the location it is just perfect. I had no problems at all, and being my first trip ever to Delhi i really needed a lot of guidance for what places to see, what to eat etc and staff gave great suggestions and helped me get around the area.

ajanta hotel ,"Its an excellent hotel with great service location and value for money We really enjoyed our stay, the staff was very helpful and provided great service.

ajanta hotel ,"Bait and Switch I am not sure how this hotel has rated 3 stars. Maybe it is the low prices, but this was not a pleasant stay. When we arrived we were shuffled off into a small room where we were told that they had no rooms. However the hotel in the rear of the building had rooms. We were logged into the books of both hotels, evidently as proof should we complain on [--] where we placed the reservation that they did not honor the booking. I believe these are the same hotels as tehy both use teh same systems and the same credit card machine located in teh Ajanta. The Hotel is in the nastiest part of town and has a club next door that plays very loud music well into the night. The picture of the front of the building is definitely photo shopped. "
ajanta hotel ,"Don't let the photos fool you. It's a budget hotel and that's exactly what it is. It's a good budget hotel but their webiste seems to fluff things a little too much. So LOWER your expectations as in way way low if you want to stay there. When I was checking in there was a big group of rather unfriendly guys, it felt like some local government office rather than a guesthouse. And then another Indian guy kept asking me to follow him out of the hotel, I didn't know what's going on, some other guy has my passport.... it was a mess. They didn't scam me or anything, but having just just arrived to Delhi, this sort of disorientation at the place you are staying isn't ideal. I made two reservations, one for when I arrive and another at the end of the trip. I cancelled the second reservation.That was my experience and I stand by my word. "
ajanta hotel ,"Good Location Rooms we Went with my own tour group had 10 of us occupying 5 rooms ,the staff knew what everybody wanted and we all had a great 2 nights here at ajanta ,this is right next to everything and a great location we booked this through sanfred travels and was a good decision.They serve food 24 hours a day which was great but yes we overate ,they have awesome balcony rooms overlooking the city and easily the best looking hotel in the area.They gave us an upgrade on our return from udaipur which was a welcome surprise.Kudos to ajanta hotels "
ajanta hotel ,"warm drinks we stayed in July 2009 in this hotel. We occupied two rooms, one single and one double.The single had no window ! Room price 40 $ !The double had a fridge which did not work. After complaints some housekeeping boyscoming three times to look after but without success !So we ordered cola which came warm, same with mineral water. Not to forget the beer,They told us to go outside for a cold beer, but this also never came.A special service was a small bucket with ice cubes for 30 Rs !!The hotel has a nice roof top restaurant but what a sense without cold drinks ?After one night we checked out and went to the neighbouring Grand hotel which wasreally great. "
ajanta hotel ,"Mrs. Ravi Kher Again This is the best hotel in the Pahargonj Area mainly in the Arakashan Road. The hotel arranged free transfer for us from the airport at midnight which was an excellent service.I visited Delhi in July. The weather was very hot with scorching heat. My son got high fever after arriving at Delhi and we had to stay in the Hotel for three days for his nursing. But we found the hotel very comfortable to do that. We stayed in 3 different rooms in the Hotel in a span of five days. 404, 215 and 319. Except 215 the other rooms were excellent. I should mention the name of Mr. Gautom whose cooperation we cannot forget.Lastly we would like to mention the the name of Mrs. Kher who arranged an excellent tour for us to visit Ajmer, Pushkar, Jaipur and Agra. Before the tour me and my wife asked her to give us comfortable vehicle and hotels, since my son was sick. She showed us the photos of the hotels in her computer. But we were a little bit afraid. She promised that all the arrangements would be as committed. During the tour we found nothing to complain to her. Rather my Father in Law joined us from Jaipur and Mrs. Kher arranged an additional room in Jaipur and Agra immediately. Again she arranged a good vehicle for us to tour Delhi in eight hours. I would highly recommend Mrs. Kher if anyone wants to tour from Delhi to other cities. She knows the customer need and keeps her commitment.I would also recommend Hotel Ajanta if anyone wants to stay in the Pahargonj area. "
ajanta hotel ,"MRS KHER I had a very good stay in the Ajanta Hotel. I could recommend this Hotel to everybody. The staff is very nice and helpful, they are always smiling. :-)I also like to recommend Mrs. Kher (Travel agency managerin in the hotel, [--]) and to thank herShe organized my trip very well and I felt alsways very, very safe. I (women, 32) travelled alone. It was very nice and very safe. Thanks Mrs. Kher.I hope to come back soon :-)See you and enjoy itGreets from SwitzerlandSeraina "
ajanta hotel ,"Highly recommend I was in Delhi last year for a quick business trip and wanted to find something centrally located and economical. I had never stayed at Hotel Ajanta before but was pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the room. The staff was very friendly and the room was very well kept, the linens were clean and crisp. Overall a great experience for the price. I would highly recommend it. "
ajanta hotel ,"budget hotel I stayed at this hotel a couple of times with my husband as we had to transit in Delhi. The first time we saw the hotel, I was really worried. I have never back packed before and the hotel was in a very crowded area and I really did not like it at all. However, as I was with my husband, I did not mind it too much. But do not believe the photos you see on their home page! The rooms were not too bad. They were quite spacious. When our flight was postponed, we stayed an additional night and they upgraded us. However, I thought that the semi-deleuxe room was better than the upgraded room!! Also, I am not so sure about the staff at the front desk. Some of them are nice but the others... I am not so sure! On my last stay I met a lady at the front desk and she seemed quite nice. The rooms could be a bit more clean. We decided not to stay here again when it took us nearly 2 hours to go to the hotel from the airport and at the end of a long travel, we were not too keen to go to some crowded place! But I think it is ok value for money (given that most hotels in Delhi are quite expensive). "
ajanta hotel ,Safe and very Friendly They made arrangements for me to be picked up from the airport &amp; gave a nice meal at 3 am at night and woke me up the next day with the breakfast ready as per my request in the email i had sent them earlier. The hotel staff spent time to answer all my questions and helped me with all my queries. I will definitely be back whenever i am in New Delhi next time. 
ajanta hotel ,"Tickets travel and holliday thanks to hotel ajanta in new delhi Myself and nelson and kelly from stellar trip management in the usa planned our journey to india and nepal with tickets to india plus our stay all with hotel ajanta ,being travel professionals we know we can be a pain when were travelling but we as a 3 team would encourage via this review whoever is behind the ajanta operations and say You guys delivered fantastically (if thats a word) we are your clients for Life !Very professional extremely hard working Team ....They did however take their sweet time to check us in but we reckoned security protocols are better adhered to than not ...Will be sending you a written recomendation soon "
ajanta hotel ,"sophisticated and affordable!! Ajanta hotel is one of the best places to stay in Delhi. Not only is it cost effective but the ambience, food and the service is superb!! Definitely recommend it to everyone to choose this as their first preference to stay in Delhi. "
ajanta hotel ,"As a single woman I needed a safe and relatively cheap place for a few hrs in the middle of the night I got into Delhi at 12:30AM and Delhi as a city has a horrible reputation for the safety of single women. I was greatly relieved to see the hotel arranged driver was waiting patiently as my flight in was delayed for over an hour. The only glitch was even though I had paid via cleartrip.com, the hotel guys said I had not made payment. However, I was able to connect to my bank and the call centre people spoke to the hotel receptionist and convinced him that my card had been charged. I was leaving at 4 the next day, so spent only about 3 hrs in my room, but it seemed a perfect fit for my specific need. The staff was very curteous and the room and bathroom was clean. "
ajanta hotel ,"Convenient location and great service. We spent four days at Ajanta enroute to Europe and found this budget-priced hotel a great bargain with clean rooms and hospitable staff. The location is very central and the hotel provides good guidance and transport for city tours. We found other facilities such as free Airport pick-up,Internet, Licensed Foreign Exchange Bureau very useful.All in all we had a very pleasant experience and would look forward to return here on our next trip to India. "
ajanta hotel ,"Terrible experience I booked a twin room in this hotel for 2 days via telephone (thats one way of booking this hotel). But when I finally reached there with my foreign friend, they said they cannot let us stay in one room if there is no relation. I tried to argue but there was no use. They shifted us to another hotel instead. The location of the hotel-Paharganj, is terrible too, no decent restaurants or cafes there. The food in hotel's restaurant is also very average. Overall, an experience woth forgetting. "
ajanta hotel ,Clean friendly hotel for a great price Stayed here for a weekend in Delhi. Location was good and central for sightseeing.We booked cars from the reception for both days - rates very very reasonable. Both drivers were reliable &amp; informative and the cars were in good condition.Only ate breakfast in the restaurant which was fine.Room was clean and bed was comfortable.Security seemed very good.For a tourist hotel it ticked all the boxes and was perfect for a weekend which was more about sightseeing than spending time in a hotel. 
ajanta hotel ,"4 Star rooms 3 star service and 2 star pricing working for a leading international hotel chain I write reviews all the time on all hotels that i stay at ,this holiday trip of mine started with the ajanta hotel in delhi.Ask them for an upgrade and they mostly oblige and I wanted to mentally challenge their every claim so went to order their butter chicken which they claim is the best in town and I was blown away super delicious served with these indian naanaz.All in all a friendly stay everybody always willing to talk help lend solution t every issue i might have even though sometimes i didnt ask for it.I will surely recomend this hotel to everybody looking for great rooms and great food on a limited budget. "
ajanta hotel ,GREAT LOCATION FRIENDLY SERVICE For the Budget traveller with a long stay in India ...all in Hotels...this one really fits the Bill..Real value for money and easy access to everywhere in Delhi and the Railway Station on its door step. 
ajanta hotel ,"Never Ever Coming Back first impression was worst I made a resrevation on Phone and I was told they will provide me Pick up and drop pff at teh airport so I cancelled another reservation which was near the airport. Pick up was horrible took time to get to Hotel then I was told at teh check in they provide one way only as either pick up or Drop off, have I been told on the phone when I made reservation I could have used Drop off as I had my car for the that time. They forced me to pay for the Airport drop off, its not matter of 400 , its matter of giving fasle information!!!So I will suggest dont rely on what you are told on phone get a written confirmation for everything and More over Dont even stay here , Airport hotels are much better, safer and more customer oriented , If it was any other hotle they could have accpeted thier mistake and provided the tranport as it was their fault of giving wrong information.Their Resturant is said to be AC but not worth sitting there its always hot some how "
ajanta hotel ,"Cant wait to go again My girlfriend and I are architects and arrived in delhi and found The ajanta to be an amazingly built property with rooms which are so royal exactly what tourists would love,later we saw other hotels and realised that this hotel looks like the grand imperial hotel in delhi from inside and its rooms except its smaller much smaller and one fourth the price,I sincerely wish they would offer rooms with a view but I guess delhi doesnt have any real views to see.All in all great service and excellent rooms Will be back "
ajanta hotel ,"Good friendly for the Price n amenities Its safe and reliable it is and that its a family run professional hotel and u took a tour to rajasthan and felt safe as they had a person in each city to help u and ensure u have a great trip... Car used for the 15 day trip was very comfortable and all hotels booked were carefully picked later learnt that they are recommended in all guide books for this travel agency called capital city travels ... I would however suggest that they should serve more sandwiches and other easy snacks etc rather than only restaurant food .,All in all good "
ajanta hotel ,"The perfect hotel for your stay in Delhi Hotel Ajanta, has been used by my family and friends since 2005. The service provided by the staff has always been excellent. I have personally booked three tours of The Golden Triangle with them and recently booked a trip for my parents who stated that Hotel Ajanta made their trip a memory they will never forget. The hotel is very well run and the facilities are more than adequate. The restaurant in the hotel provides some of the best Indian food I have had in India. You can simply sit at home in front of your computer and plan your trip of India with Hotel Ajanta. They have never let my family or friends down. I strongly recommend staying in this hotel, and definitely booking your tours through them. "
ajanta hotel ,Wide variety of rooms The facilities are good and comfortable with a wide variety of rooms to choose from. The rooms are well maintained. Only problem is the location which is a bit shabby. 
ajanta hotel ,"Mixed feelings The hotel is located at a busy lane near the New Delhi Railway station. Thats the primary reason I chose the hotel for my three day stay. Also, they offered a pickup from the airport (free). We arrived at Delhi airport on a Saturday and the hotel driver was there at the airport to pick us up. I was slightly taken aback by the appearance of the street where the hotel is located, being very crowded, however, the hotel itself was neat and well maintained. The stay at the hotel was comfortable. However, both the restaurant and the room service lacked promptness. The food quality was average. I think its best to avoid the travel desk at the hotel. The rates are high and no where near value for money. Another negative point was the fact that they did not accept credit card for final settlement and I had to run to find an ATM to draw cash in order to make the final settlement. "
ajanta hotel ,"For sure worth the stay The rooms were comfortable, staff was warm and helpful. Food wad great and is centrally located to get around the city. "
ajanta hotel ,clean safe place to stay-good value for money I was travelling to India with a girlfriend and was warned by several friends about the safety factor in delhi for girls. We were greeted by a friendly driver at the airport and taken to the hotel. The room service was good and the fact that there was an in-house restaraunt helped on days that we wanted to spend time relaxing. All together the stay was safe and comfortable and good value for money. I would suggest offering non smoking rooms. The staff was very warm and friendly. 
ajanta hotel ,"Defiantely Worth the trip back home :) As soon as I arrived in the hotel, I was impressed with the warm and sincere welcome of the staff who offered to assist me in any way I needed. Check In was superb and and done so in an efficient manner.The room setup was beautiful and exceeded my expectations to a much higher level.The staff from all departments of the hotel were very professional and courteous and always had a friendly smile on their face, no matter what time of the day, "
ajanta hotel ,"Value for Money I stayed here March 3-9 2009. Check in was quick and painless. The room was HUGE, very nice and extremely clean. With a king size bed, there was a coffee maker, microwave and mini-fridge in the room. Bathroom was very nice with a marble sink, tub, shower with extremely hot water. Plenty of towels and toiletries! TV was excellent - with an extremely good range of channels Its greatest asset is location, very close to the popular shopping places like CP and Karol Bagh. Staff were friendly, efficient and helpful even though they were extremely busy. "
ajanta hotel ,"NO VALUE for MONEY The room was neat and clean. But the TV provided by them and NO wi-fi connection makes u feel that u entered into some low budget hotel. No doubt a bath tub will be provided but i dont know wat they xpect us to do without proper water storage in dat tub. (there was prob wid d valve n culdnt stop draining of water)Even the water bottles, chips &amp; cold drinks provided in the room are charged, nothing is complimentary. And more over the food in the restaurant is NOT at all worth that price, bad taste and bad quantity. "
ajanta hotel ,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone Recently I stayed at Ajanta only to be ambushed on arrival by Mrs Kher - the inhouse travel agent - who arranged for travel for the remaining time that I spent in India - on the following day I requested that all travel plans be cancelled - which I was told was not possible - but was given a reduuction of INR 21,000 of total of travel costs - After leaving New Delhi I again requested that all plans made by Capitol City Travel be cancelled - and was ignored for a few days - then to be told that yes it can be cancelled &quot;but you will loose some money&quot; - I have been back from india for over a month and still have not recieved any refund from these people - BUYER BEWARE - I thought that i was just checking into a hotel initially - not booking a holiday - I would not recommend this Hotel or Capitol City Travel to anyone - check more reviews for confirmation of this at TripAdvisor.com "
ajanta hotel ,"Nice hotel Shame about the location This is a really nice hotel. We had a free airport pick up, the room was clean with a good shower and the restaurant was excellent. It is only a shame that it is located more in the old part of Delhi rather than New Delhi as advertised,(It is a 50Rs rickshaw ride to connaught place) which means that a white tourist is some what a novelty. Be prepared to have more stares when walking round. I dont think I would recommend a lone female traveller to stay here. The room was very noisy through out the day and night; dogs barking, horns beeping and general crowded area sounds. On the whole a good hotel. "
ajanta hotel ,"An okay choice for a short stay and for the price We stayed at the hotel for two nights on our way to Varanasi. We organised a transfer from the airport through the hotel and we had a seamless trip and check in.We booked a room for two people and it was a little small and cramped although comfortable for a short stay. They are clean and our shower was very good with plenty hot water! A bonus in India.We were not so overly impressed by the service at the hotel. We found that their quotes for drivers, taxis and day trips were very expensive. We never really got the feeling they were trying their best to help us. This is an issue with Delhi in general and we would recommend researching tours, drivers before arrival so you have options. "
ajanta hotel ,"Ok Hotel in Delhi My wife and I have stayed in this hotel around 4 times between January and March. The good thing about the hotel is that the prices are quite reasonable compared to Delhi standards. It is also in a central crowded area close to the Delhi railway station. If you want a quite residential area, this is not a place for you.. The room are clean and generally well maintained.. They have different types of room but more or less all of them look same. So no point in spending more money on a higher room. If you arrange with them early, they also provide free airport pick up. But during our last stay, the car didn’t come. But they provided free airport drop instead. The room service is also quite good. But my major prob with this place is that the bell boys who hung around you all the time for tips.. Sometimes it gets on to your nerve.. Although the reception is generally good, some times they can be a bit rude.. From a safety point of view it looks ok as we noticed a lot of female tourists.. However I would be reluctant to allow my wife stay here alone, as the street is quite crowded and not sure whether it is safe for a single female traveling alone. Also if you are just looking to spend one night in Delhi due to flight connection, it makes more sense to stay somewhere else close to airport.. "
ajanta hotel ,"The staff made the difference Well, I have to say that all the EMPLOYEES have been so nice with me, caring alot about my staying...and this made the difference about my journey in New Delhi, making me feel comfortable and safe like home. Rooms are not like those shown on the website (on the website you see only the best ones ..:-) :-) , so at the arrival I was not satisfied about mine and they upgraded me immediately for free in a Superior Room N. 419 (this room need a real closet, the one inside is invisible a small hole). BY THE WAY, THANK YOU EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY MR. ARVINDER. I left the hotel for 2 days going to Agra and they let me leave my 2 heavy lugguages at the hotel. Coming back I had a Standard Room with A/C n. 218 with a very good bathroom just renovated, even better than the Superior I had before. Beds are comfortable. Restaurant is nice and good, closing late at night and buffet breakfast in the morning is 200 RS. I found very useful the pick up service at the airport included in the price. There is a 24 hours Internet service, but sometimes you can have problem with lines (30 min 30RS - 1 hour 60RS) The street is very noisy, very very noisy, so bring something for your ears otherwise you wont be able to sleep.Now one thing important to say to my WESTERN FRIENDS (cause i red some bad staff reviews)......the reception sometimes is a little bit messy, crowded, people come and go and you dont understand who is a guest and who is an employee. Probably staff will stop you hundred times asking you where you go, what your plan is....etc etc ...SO, DONT BE SCARED OF IT... ..WE ALL KNOW THAT BUSINESS IS BUSINESS, it is just the indian way to do it.....in Europe we do the same only in a different way...so my advise is BE ALWAYS NICE AND FRIENDLY TO STAFF...listens to what they have to say, and their proposals, anyway remember that the last decison is always up to you...To the hotel staff I should recommend to always introduce themselves and smile to guests before jump on them... :-) :-) :-) remember that some Western people might be scared and impressioned by arriving in the hectic and caotic Delhi.....so give them time to get used of it and make them feel safe like home. "
ajanta hotel ,"Not as cheap as you would expect altogether bad value for money The main problem with the Ajanta is that it is run by a management team that has no centralised system of communications, so that you have to record yourself anything you pay for in order to make sure that you can defend your case when they do not find a trace of your advance payment.But what I found the most suspicious about them is the way that they charge you a 10% 'service fee' on top of the usual 12.5% luxury tax tourists normally pay. This dramatically increased the cost of accomodation, making the Ajanta almost as expensive as some 4 star hotels in much nicer areas of Delhi! Funny enough, one of the manager proposed to reduce that service charge to 5% if I chose to pay in cash, which I refused. Do I smell tax evasion? Anyhow, I have never seen anywhere charge 10% service on top of your room fee, especially since porters and others employees still expect to be tipped. It is all very dodgey and I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone unless you enjoy being ripped off. "
ajanta hotel ,"Fair Hotel for just a overnight Our permanence in New Delhi would be only for one night. We wouldarrive in Delhi the 23:00 hs and the flight to Kathmandu would be inthe following morning and we found convenient the location and the free pickup in theairport offered by Ajanta Hotel. I found the driver very easily and itwas nice welcome to New Delhi by avoiding the grounds of all the taxi hawkers attn the airport. But a good clue is to buy the pre-pay taxi at the airport that cost 230.00rupees (about of US$ 5.00). You don't have to bargain with the driver!At the hotel the room was clean. Bathroom was clean. I didn't see anycockroaches or mosquitoes. I was quite pleased with my room, number 9,outside of the building.Seemed to be an annex. Unhappily the room didn't have a window .(??)But the big surprise was when we check out and we came across a&quot;luxury tax&quot; of 12.5% and a service tax of 10%, what did of the HotelAjanta a &quot;fake 4 stars&quot;. (just in the price of course!!)What should have cost US$60.00 cost us US$ 80.00. Also they charged us 400.00 rupees for thetaxi of turn to the airport. (turist trap).If you don't have plans for the nex day take care!! It will be followed in breakfast by a personnel that had tried to sell the anycost a full day trip for any place.Very pusher!! "
ajanta hotel ,"Bad start to India trip Having read a number of reviews I feel relieved that many experiences mirror mine. Pick up from the airport was good, but we 'paid' for that by having a small, dingy room on the first night for which we paid appx AUS$60. Taken into a room and interrogated about our travel plans. We were backpacking and didn't want a tour, but they were like a dog with a bone and wouldn't leave us be. By the time we left, we'd gotten used to ducking for cover each time we saw the travel agent lady! Extremely pushy. Extremely nosy. Extremely bad manners! We couldn't leave the hotel without someone asking where we were going and who we were meeting, and where we were going next, and where we were planning to stay. It was a terrible start to our holiday and unfortunately put us off staying in any hotel which ran a travel service as we assumed they would all be the same. Thankfully we found out later they weren't. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone and I would never stay there again. "
ajanta hotel ,"Great Customer Service - good coft stay Overall experience was wonderful, very comfortable stay right from the pick-up till the drop back to the airport. Customer service was great and the rooms were very clean and quiet gives you a feeling of staying away from the hectic city.Great facilities like neat and hygenic food at the restaurant, Business Centre, Internet access, Shop. Good food and quick room service.. I would consider staying at the same place again :) "
ajanta hotel ,"A Traveller's Haven in New Delhi The best mid-range hotel we stayed at in India. Good food, good company, good service, and a clean bright room. Thanks to Mrs. Kher at the travel desk for organising a wonderful tuk-tuk sightseeing trip for us. Free collection from the airport.ANNA and ANTHONY SCHLESINGER, BATH UK. "
ajanta hotel ,"Ajanta Hotel Delhi: Good place good people Stayed at Ajanta fHotel not far from the very central Old Delhi train station or a week or so for ain international conference I attended in Delhi. Very comfortable and clean room, very happy to discover free WiFi in effect, nice restaurant on ground floor and on the roof. I upgraded to two better rooms on the last two days when my wife joined up along with a friend-couple our travelling companions from back home.Mrs Kher and all her good staff made all of us feel very welcome, and we are very glad we set up our generic post-convention tourism away from Delhi through Mrs Kher, making our arrangements upon the group's arrival at the hotel. The Chandigarh and Benares hotels, and all the Delhi and other town drivers and guides Mrs Kher arranged, were fine. We particularly appreciated that when we missed our train one early AM due to unfamiliarity and tricky &quot;helpful bystanders&quot; (touts) at the nearby railway station, Mrs Kher promptly arranged new tickets, provided us a ride back to the station where she met us and got us safely on our way.Best time to travel India in Northern hemisphere terms: mid-late fall through mid-late spring. It was terribly hot and humid when we were there mid-sept to early October. Ajanta air conditioning made a big difference; it's optional/extra but midspring through mid fall be sure to get it! "
ajanta hotel ,Nice Central Hotel A great central hotel near the train station and a helpful Manager Mrs Kher who organised out trip to Varanasi. The hotel is clean and the staff will get you anything you need for your rooms quickly. Mrs Kher also arranged a pick up from the train station and airport. The restuarant next door is nice food was nice aswell. The street at night was illuminated with all the hotels and travel agents names in very bright lights. All in all always agree a best price be it hotel or tours or clothes. India is an amazing place. Yet like in any country buyer beware.We went around Jaipur / agra / Ramthambore and saw a Tiger on our first cantar ride. AWESOME. 
ajanta hotel ,Great value It was a great value and extremely good service. 
ajanta hotel ,"Great Holiday Experience at an Affordable Price. we went to delhi in december to attend my cousin's wedding &amp; stayed at the Ajanta Hotel. the service provided was excellent! very conveniently located near my cousin's place. We were picked up from the airport by the hotel staff for free. on the drive from the airport the driver updated us on all the new places that had opened up such as restaurants, malls, etc. very friendly &amp; nice fellow. At the hotel we were greeted by the manager of the hotel who was really helpful in helping us plan our travel itinery. we told him that we wanted to see the Taj Mahal in Agra &amp; the Fatehpur Sikri Fort after my cousin's wedding was over. Our room was really nicely done and was very clean (I'm very fussy about hygiene &amp; cleanliness). didn't expect it to be so nice considering the deal we got. the restaurant was nice too but breakfast was a bit expensive. The location too was really cool. just 5 mins drive to connaught place which is the centre point of delhi &amp; has amazing shops &amp; restaurants. Janpath was my favorite shopping haunt for handicrafts &amp; junk jewelry &amp; colorful embroidered bags. very bohemian stuff at prices that are exorbitant but you can manage to fit it in your budget by hardcore bargaining. I loved haggling with the vendors! never get to do that here in Vancouver. The highlight of our visit to India was our Agra trip. We rode to the Taj on a camel cart. Darn exciting experience. it was our First camel cart ride. The Taj is the most beautiful monument we've ever seen. the hotel arranged for a guide for us to explain the history of this gorgeous monument. Excellent guide! he was very informative and witty. the hotel guy arranged for a professional photographer who clicked our pictures very artfully. After the taj, we went to Fatehpur Sikri Fort which is a very intriguing monument. its sitiuated on top of a hill and has this massive gate that made us feel so tiny. the fort has a white marble mosque where it is believed that whatever you wish for will come true and has had visits from top celebrities and bollywood stars. huge compound but very crowded. children selling stuff really pestered us. but on the whole a great fun place to visit. the ajanta staff really made our stay worthwhile. we will definitely stay with them again whenever we visit India again and recommend this hotel to everyone! Cheers guys! Thanks a ton for making our stay Memorable!Best Regards,Rachita &amp; Gang "
ajanta hotel ,"good value! Booking was easy, got a great price for the central location in Delhi. Near the railway station, super easy to travel outside delhi. Hotel arranged pick up from airport, got me tickets for the train to Agra, set up sight seeing around Delhi, reccomended authentic place to see. They even have their own restaurant and travel agency, which was very convinient for me. Room was nice and clean. All in all, exceptional service! "
ajanta hotel ,"Not bad... remember to haggle with Mrs Kehr!! My girlfriend and I arrived in Dehli and grabbed a taxi straight to the Hotel Ajanta.We were both exhausted from our flight and also a bit nervous about the start of our planned 4 months of backpacking before arriving in New Zealand.As soon as we arrived, we were ushered into a little room where we met Mrs Kehr, a representative of Capital Tours.She asked us what we had planned for our 2 months in India, and we replied that we were just going to wing it.She planned everything for us.A driver called Dinesh, who was a really fantastic guy... very knowledgable, with really good English.He took us around Rajasthan, to Agra then another driver (who was rubbish) took us to Khajuraho, Bandhavgar Tiger Reserve and Varanasi.We haggled with prices a LOT... so felt that we got an average deal.I must say though her first price (which we halved) would have been a HUGE rip off.The hotel Ajanta itself was well located in Delhi. The room average sized, could have done with a paint job and not that clean... but you do get what you pay for.Overall, I would say that it was a really good place to start our experience in India! "
ajanta hotel ,"Good pick up We booked one night through Expedia for A$52.15. My main reason for choosing this hotel was that we were arriving at 10pm on New Years Eve and the Ajanta offered a free airport pick-up. The pick up from the airport worked perfectly.Our room was clean but plain and too small. It was like a king-sized bed in a single room. There are reasonable rooms at the Ajanta but you may be lucky to actually get one. The second night we stayed there, on our return journey, was better furnished but still too small and just stank of smoking. The clothes in our bags smelt of smoke days afterwards. It was disgusting.The final room that we stayed in before flying out was better furnished and more spacious. But that was after paying for a very expensive tour that we purchased from the in-house travel agent. There are six different standards of room according to their website and I do not know the standards of the rooms in which we stayed. Whatever the initial cost of a room, that is the place from which to negotiate a better price. Everything here has the rider of 'by Indian standards' and should be negotiable.The Hotel Ajanta is in a street of hotels. It is fairly close to the New Delhi Railway Station but with the degree of difficulty in just walking down the street, you still need a rickshaw or autorickshaw to get there with luggage, or back, start from Rs20. The area is walking distance from Connaught Circle, without luggage.The restaurant is small but quite attractive. First morning there was a breakfast buffet for Rs200 which was expensive, but convenient. Another morning, at a reasonable hour, we had to walk into the darkened restaurant and tell them to open up. The food is okay and the service is 'Indian standard'. "
ajanta hotel ,"Great service!! We were in New Delhi last month for my cousin's wedding. We stayed at the Ajanta hotel for about a week and a half, and it was a great experience overall. The staff was very polite and friendly. The lobby staff went out of their way to help us find the things that we needed around town, like finding shops, etc. I would definitely recomment all my friends to go stay there if they go to India. Thanks Guys!! - Sunny Parmar &amp; Family. "

ajanta hotel ,"Constantly mislead I arrived in Nov in Delhi with my mom. We booked Ajanta online because it was easy. As expected we were picked up at the airport. The rooms were not as nice as the photos online, at all. We arrived late so had little choice. The next morning a woman introduced herself, we later found out she ran Capital City Tours, Mrs. Kher. She asked us our plans. She made us believe she was booking trains for us and mid range hotels. The price for 2 was $1700 for 10 days, we thought it was a lot, but it was 7 am and we were in a foreign place. Next she said it was complimentary to be toured around Delhi, so we went. That was when we discovered we hired a personal driver for 6 days. He was nothing but annoying! He would only take us to places where he got commission, fed our mind with crazy stories about being poisoned and raped, and complained about his job the entire time. He also was falling asleep while driving and refused to pull over to nap. Most of the hotels were really nice, one was disgusting. He was supposed to stay with us for 6 days - but we let him go a day early because he was so obnoxious. Then we were on our own for the next 4 days- nothing included in the original $. The last day of our trip we had prepaid for an overnight train ride and a hotel in Mumbai through Mrs. Kher. Unfortunately we were in a bus accident (side note: dont take busses most of the drivers are drunk). My mother couldnt continue to travel so we began booking flights home early. We called Mrs. Kher she was super nice saying she would help us with what ever needed and she would refund us our $100 for the last portion of the trip. It is 2 months, 3 phone calls, and many emails later and we still havent been refunded. On the phone she would say check in 2 days, it just went through, I'll send you confirmation. NOTHING. She fed us with lies to shut us up, so now I am writing this so people know it is a bad business and if something unfortunate should happen they will only lie to make you happy but not follow through. "
ajanta hotel ,"great hotel Stayed here in November for 2 days- friendly, curteous staff, clean roomstravel agency in hotel was v useful and got a great deal to stay overnight in Agra travelling down by train. Incidentally, hotel is v close to the train station in delhi.would gladly recommend this hotel to friends/family staying in Delhi. "
ajanta hotel ,"What a Gem Traveled to Delhi in December 2008 from San Francisco last minute with a few buddies and booked the Hotel on a friends recommendation who had stayed there before.I was glad to find the hotel better than expected, and great value for money compared to other hotels in the busy touristy neighborhood.The rooms were clean and spacious, Internet connectivity was great. The hotel staff was courteous, with good service and helped plan our trip in Delhi. We were also able to book tours to Agra &amp; Jaipur through the Hotel in a private taxi last minute at very reasonable rates. On the way out our flight was delayed due to fog in Delhi and missed our connection back to the states. The Hotel accommodated us last minute for 2 days and provided to and from transportation from the airport promptly in the middle of the night.Highly recommended place to stay for travelers. Thanks Ajanta. "
ajanta hotel ,"Decent hotel convenient to train station We had a really hard time finding a hotel in Delhi but chose Hotel Ajanta for its proximity to the New Delhi train station as we had a early morning train to catch to Agra. The hotel is not in the best neighborhood but I think you could say that about most of the hotels in India. It was only a short walk to the station and was quite comfortable, save for the extremely noisy neighborhood. The best part though is probably the attached restaurant. Breakfast wasn't anything special but after a long day of sightseeing, dinner at the restaurant was superb. "
ajanta hotel ,"Great Hotel in Delhi We highly recommend this hotel!We booked our trip through lastminute.com and then found www.hotelajanta.com and organised our FREE complimentary pick up from the airport.We booked the superior room which was very spacious with a super-king sized bed, air conditioning, TV, table and chairs, kettle, mini bar (with shop price drinks &amp; snacks), shower en-suite and towels.The restaurant was lovely too - proud staff, tasty food and bargain prices!About a 15 minute walk to Connaught Place or a cheap 50R ride by auto rickshaw. "
ajanta hotel ,Overpriced but adequate hotel We booked a deluxe room with airport pickup before we left for India. The airport pickup went well and was appreciated since we arrived about 2 am. The deluxe room had no window and the toilet leaked. They showed us two other deluxe rooms but one had no window and the other had a tiny window however the toilet didn't leak in this room. The TV worked in both rooms. The rooms were clean enough. The restaurant was adequate but nothing special. We used their travel service to book a tour and that went well. I would recommend Capital City Travel. 
ajanta hotel ,"Not a bad hotel but noisy outside This was not a bad hotel and the rooms were fine - though we had booked two double rooms for two couples, and one couple got a room with ensuite bathroom and double bed, and the other couple got two single beds and use of a bathroom across the hall. The hotel has a pretty good restaurant and there is a shop selling bottled water etc just across the road. The worst thing about the hotel however was the noise - I could barely sleep all night because of horns blasting and dogs barking. Having said that, a lot of the other hotels I was considering booking seemed to be on equally busy roads if not worse. The Ajanta did seem pretty expensive for what it is - we paid the same price in a smaller town (Gwalior) a few days later for a much better hotel. Having said that, the Ajanta is probably a lot better than some of the more 'budget' accommodation available and we had no problems other than the noise. The reception will also exchange foreign currency and travellers cheques which was helpful. "
ajanta hotel ,"Better than the street; good if desperate. Needed a place for 10 hours between flights (overnight).Booked it as they had a good website (with OBVIOUSLY carefully selected angles of photos). We were exhausted and were shown a bad room in some mildew corner of the hotel. No windows, basic bathroom, sterile vibe. So, went to see another. And another. Al the same bad boring feeling. Probably worth about 7-8$ a night if not for AC. But really just a very dark place with a nice (and far too busy reception with rather dodgy people). I you have taste and are with a lady, forget about this place for anything more than one emergency night. "
ajanta hotel ,"More than adequate Hotel Ajanta was ok with us. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, my wife and I were apprehensive about staying here. Well, the airport pickup went without a hitch. They claim to be close to the airport, but are more like central Delhi, about 40 minutes from the airport. The neighborhood is the real Delhi, lots of interesting stuff going on in the street. We even got to watch a performance of the Ramayana in a small park adjacent to the hotel. Staff was friendly, but we didn't book anything through the hotel. You can avoid that kind of pressure by staying on a night-to-night basis. Our Superior room was a little small but quite clean by Indian hotel standards. In retrospect, the bad reviews on this site reflect more about Indian hotels in general than Ajanta specifically. We only stayed one night as a layover and this was fine, we got a little taste of Delhi with no problems. If you’re staying for a week a more in Delhi, it might be fun to treat yourself to a fancier place for a couple nights. But considering some of the other possibilites for Delhi hotels, Ajanta is more than adequate. "
ajanta hotel ,"We really like this hotel We have been coming to India (so in and out of Delhi) continuously over the last 10 years and now we do business out of Delhi. Having tried the very cheap (100 rupees) end of hotels and the very expensive (£50 a night) we have settled very nicely in the middle with Ajanta. We have never experienced anything other than friendly and polite service, clean rooms, excellent food in the restaurant and all our business contacts are impressed with standards too when they visit for meetings. So we give it the definite thumbs up and will continue to use as our Delhi base without hesitation. Nicholas and Laura Barwick, UK "
ajanta hotel ,"Stay Away! My email correspondence with this hotel should have been enough warning to stay away however I persisted and put it down to lack of English communication. Upon check in we were requested to go into a room which can only be described as a customs integration office. After this lengthy process we were advised that our room was available, numerous times I asked if the room type was the presidential suite that I had paid for before arriving and the check in lady advise 'yes this room type is the one you have booked'. Upon arriving in the room and further questioning of the front office staff it was apparent that we were not given the room type requested however given one that was three or four times a lower standard. It was also very apparent that if we did not question the matter that the hotel staff was happy for us to stay in the lower room type without refunding us the difference. After a lengthy discussion at the front desk the following day, the check out person reluctantly refunded us what was rightfully ours.During our stay we found the hotel staff to all be very unhelpful and rude. The lack of communication within the front desk was very annoyning having to report the same thing to three different people. The only thing going for this hotel was the friendly driver that greeted us at the airport. If staying in Delhi I would not recommend to stay at this hotel. There are numerous other hotels along the same road that be suitable. The rooms do not look at all like the ones displayed on the internet. "
ajanta hotel ,"Booked Stayed Regretted Ok so this is a few years ago, but still... I booked the Hotel Ajanta for my first trip to India. I figured out myself how to get there, having read up on the various taxi scams going on at Delhi Airport!The hotel itself isn't bad. The rooms are not as clean as they can be, but whatever. My problems began when I told the inhouse travel-agent that I wanted to see Rajastan. They sold me a 7-day trip with driver etc. etc. etc. Needless to say, it was a complete disaster, and after the first day I demanded to be returned to Delhi, and I got back to the hotel I demanded my money back. After some serious arguing, they caved and refunded me. So that was good. After a second terrible experience with an organised tour (with another agency) I steered clear of tour agencies for the rest of my trip.All in all, it's an ok place to stay, they're fairly honest, fairly clean, but quite expensive (700rp a night). For the rest of my time in India I never spent more than 400rp a night for a room. "
ajanta hotel ,"Fabulous My buddy from L.A recommedned me. I came to stay here with my friends. Awesome stay. Great staff and must try out the &quot;BUTTER CHICKEN, DAAL MAKHANI (Lentils).5 Mins from Conaught Place and late night pick ups available from airport. Above all we felt very safe and comfortable. Checkout the newly renovated rooms. "
ajanta hotel ,"Among the best I have experienced Being an avid traveller I have travelled all over the world and have stayed in hotels big and small. Staying at Ajanta was a very pleasent experience - made my trip more comfortable and memorable. Location is excellent and ameneties are at par with most botique hotels around the world. However the best part was their customer service. They took care of me and my family and made us feel at home. What better can you ask when you are in a non-familiar environment with kids. Friendly, trustworthy and eager to serve staff - man, I will definately go back there and will highly reccomend it to all my fellow travellers. "
ajanta hotel ,"Excellent service It's really the best hotel you can get at an affordable price, good service &amp; at a convenient location. Kudos! "
ajanta hotel ,"Amazing hotel because it's got the 'People' touch. Unrivalled hospitality. The hotel is run by genuine, warm and caring folks who actually welcome you as more than a guest. At Hotel Ajanta, you're family. Leaving you wanting for nothing, the management and staff have the unique ability to satisfy even the unexpressed needs of their guests. Highly recommended place. "
ajanta hotel ,"The worst hotel in the world I have ever stayed in We were constantly arguing with this cheating hotel. It ruined our holiday and cheated us out of money. DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL. On the first day it took 6 hours to check in on a pre-booked room. The room had cockroaches and they changed our room but it was missing a bed. It then took 2 hours to get the bed. They also accused us of not paying despite having a receipt and they tried to make us pay twice.As soon as you arrive they make you see the tourist lady, a lying cheat. DO NOT buy trips from her. She sold us trips which were not possible and a car we couldn’t use due to Independance Day. She tried to sell us trips totalling 20, 000 rupees (£250). Thank god we took the cheaper option. She knew the trips and the use of the car were not possible but she sold us the trips, with no conscience, to make money. She then wouldn’t give us our money back. She also constantly lied when we were trying to sort things out and constantly changed her story. She was not sorry at all for her actions. I have never met a lady as bad as this lady in my life.There are a lot of hotels in Delhi to stay in and this is not one I would recommend to my worst enemy. "
ajanta hotel ,"Tried to make us pay twice for the rooms! We booked two rooms to stay one night at Ajanta hotel on July 13, 2008. We gave our credit card number before our arrival for payment. After staying one night and checking out, the man at the front desk asked for payment again. When we told him we had already made the payment via credit card, he said that payment hadn't gone through yet so he needed cash. When we asked what if later, after paying cash, the credit payment came through. The man said that he would refund the money back! As though we are fools. We told him we it was his look out to check about payment and that we are not fools to pay him double.He also was going to charge us for food we never ordered the night before. We only asked for mineral water. But also tried to add in some bill for food items.The front area has been renovated and so were some of the rooms. But the pictures on the website was nothing like the rooms we stayed in. It was in much more dull.The door locks with an olden style key which kept jamming.My room was very basic with small bed and a small tv. The other room with a double bed had no tv and a mini-fridge that didn't work.Please be wary when you stay here. "
ajanta hotel ,"Most horrible place I've ever stayed This hotel is a joke. Don't stay here. I know there isn't much choice in Delhi of clean, decent value places, but there has to be better than this dump. Our sheets were filthy, the staff were HORRIBLE and very shifty, waiting outside our room until we left the next morning, and the bathroom was dirty too. Avoid at all costs. Such a rip off. "
ajanta hotel ,"Bad Experience I have to say that staying in this stupid hotel was the most horrible experience in my life.i stayed there in 1st week of may 2008.i was picked up by the hotel chauffer from my midnight flight (only nice thing during my stay as it was complimentary as promised) . was escorted into a smelly indica car with no a/c. (i was promised over phone that a/c car will be there for pickup and drop by a lady who talked to me).the drive was smooth. i was expecting a big hotel as for appearence from what i saw from website picture. i was driven to a road which was congested , unclean, bustling with activity even in the midnight. i was ushered to the reception.( i was supposed to be given a welcome drink as the website promised . but i was not even welcomed inside). after asking for a room the manager told me to give my icard( i have heared about iphone but icard seems to be something that i cannot discover) atlast it came to my mind that it was i-d card and so gave it to him. i was alloted a standard a/c room. the hotel ppl navigated me into a labyrinth of maze and i was given room no 303 in one corner. it was a very small room with a tv and a fridge that did not work and was meant to hold a couple of fanta bottles. the door did not have a proper secure lock so i had to use my room key to lock each time. the bed was tooooosmall to hold two ppl. and the bedsheet which was given was meant for one and to be shared by 2 people. whole night there was light from outside glowing and we heared sounds of autorickshaw pying. so didnt get proper sleep at all.the bathroom was ordinary. next morning after bath (luckily luke warm water was available) and we went into the hotel restaurant which had no south indian food items . i was forced to eat badly burnt bread and omlette with tuttifruities in it. we had planned to go out so we gave the keys to reception and asked them to clean the room. we came back in evening and asked for keys. the reception manager was fumbling coz the keys were not returned to reception after cleaning. we had to wait for 1/2 hour to get the duplicate keys. finally we had to suffer the same insomnia next night too. and the worst of all when we asked for the car to drop us in the airport we were told that only pickup was complimentary and drop was chargable at a nominal price of rs 350/-. so i hade to once again fish out money to get a car since i had to board the flight urgently. overall it was a very bad experience staying in ajantha "
ajanta hotel ,"Decent tourist class hotel Checking in was an experience. We were taken to see so many people when all we wanted to do was get to our room (Trying to sell tours/excursions/flights.....do not do it....sort it all out yourself as it's much cheaper)When we eventually got to the room, it turned out to be simple, basic but clean enough. Consierge tried to sell us an upgrade when we arrived in the room, but we refused. Don't think those rooms were much different to the one we had!!! Air conditioning and ceiling fan a must India in April and we had them!!!Restaurant was good for breakfast and dinner. Buffet breakfast only available when you arrive in the morning. If you pretend to leave a full al la carte becomes available hahaha...Try it yourself!!!!!Gave us a a lovely cake for one of our birthdays when we were staying there. Would have enjoyed it more only for the dreaded Delhi Belly, but that was not their fault!!!!!Internet is available at a small cost "
ajanta hotel ,"Treated like a Criminal I booked a room at this hotel with a Nepali friend before flying home. As my flight was due to leave next morning, I only reserved one room for us both as I would have to leave the hotel at 1.30am.The hotel refused to give us a room, despite the booking and the fact that there were rooms available. The reason? Apparently it was because my friend is Nepali and male and I am English and female, and there was no way they were going to give us a room together, despite the fact that I would only be there a couple of hours.It took us an hour of arguing, being stuck in an office with the staff staring at us, before we were offered a room in another hotel. We were either treated like criminals or ignored like a problem they hoped would go away.I do not think we would have been treated like this if my travelling companion had been of another nationality. This is one hotel I will never ever stay in again (not that I did) nor would I recommend it to anyone. "
ajanta hotel ,"Average rooms very efficient travel agency We stayed in this hotel for two nights first and one additional night after taking a four-day trip to Agra and Jaipur through the hotel's travel agency. First night's small room was a small disappointment, since we had reserved a semi-business room. However, the travel agency manager of the hotel asked as the first thing in the morning, if we liked/disliked the room and gave us another room for the second night. It was better. The room for the last night was ok as well, but the toilet didn't flush without first pouring water in it from the bucket. Food in the restaurant was average, but there are some well worth restaurants nearby to go to.Roof top bar is very basic, but internet facilities very adequate. The hotel has currency exchange and prepaid-taxi desk and a complimentary pick-up service from the airport (worked well).The travel agency in the hotel is surely worth recommending. We got a good deal for a four-day trip to Agra (own accomodation already reserved for two nights) and Jaipur (one night accomodation in the package) including airconditioned mid-size car with a very professional and nice driver and separate guides for both cities and a one-day sightseeing with a driver in Delhi plus the last night accomodation in Ajanta. Altogether very efficient, convenient and easy. No use for trying to gather the package together on our own with bus/train tickets and the hassle with baggage. "
ajanta hotel ,"Ripped off i, and a female friend, booked into the Hotel Ajanta before we left England. neither of us had been to India before so i checked the internet and booked our holiday on there.on our arrival in Delhi Airport we were met by a driver who took us to the hotel. that's when we faced our first obstacle. we were given a poky windowless room. after much arguing with the staff we were allocated a room at the front of the building, this was also poky but did have a balcony overlooking the street. we stayed the nights of 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th February 2008, leaving at midday on the 18th. in all that time our room was not cleaned nor the towels changed. the roof-top restaurant was a building site, with no service at all. luckily we only used the hotel as a base. on the 16th February we asked about a trip to Agra, taking a car for the day. we were quoted Rs4000, which we declined. we found a more reasonable rate across the road.we had also booked two nights, 4th and 5th March 2008, so that we had someplace to go at the end of our visit to India. on arrival on 4th March we were told they didn't have a room for us. after much arguing we were given a room, windowless, but larger than the original one. as it was for only one night (we booked for the night of 5th March but was leaving at 11pm for the airport) we decided to make do.all was well until we went to settle the bill. (we had previously heard others arguing about their bills but thought nothing of it) we ended up paying more for the two nights than we had for our original stay of four nights. as time was pressing, to get to the airport, we had no choice but to pay up. included in the bill was charges for cleaning the room twice,.. it had not been cleaned whilst we were there. When we arrived at the hotel on 4th March we had already paid Rs 1000, on enquiring what our balance was i was told Rs1460. on checking out we had to pay Rs2430. i will be returning to India late 2009 but will not be staying at the Hotel Ajanta again.am i satisfied with the hotel, would i recommend it? definitely not! "
ajanta hotel ,Service with a scowl Pros - Close to New Delhi train station and about a 10-15min walk from Connaught Place.Cons - Service with a scowl. This place is terrible. We've been traveling in India for 6 weeks and the Hotel Ajanta is one of the worst we've stayed at. The rooms are ok (a little pricey for what you get) though don't expect to get your room cleaned. The location is decent. The staff are generally miserable to interact with. The seem to actively dislike their patrons which makes for a rather unpleasant hotel stay. There are better places to stay in Delhi so avoid this hotel if you can. 
ajanta hotel ,"Good location reasonable price Not in New Delhi, but close to the main railway station and on the edge of Old Delhi, this hotel offers reasonable value for money with an airport pick-up included.. The location could be a culture shock if you`ve no experience of the third world.Bedrooms can be noisy, we had a large suite which was well equipped and no problems..Breakfast was extra at 175rps but very good. There is a travel agency within the hotel. "
ajanta hotel ,"scams - watch your back here when we arrived we were told we had to check in through the travel agent, he faffed around with our voucher in reception for a while and after a night on the train then the delhi tuk tuk drivers I insisted i would check in at reception not the travel agent. The receptionist told me they were check out not check in even though the Indian woman in front of me was checking in. Grrrr, had to go back to travel agents.Fortunately he could not do a hard sell as we were not even staying all night.Room clean, windowless. All we needed. Breakfast most excellent.Travel agent came in to breakfast and was trying to accost breakfasters for a tour.Lots of people loitering around on each floor. Some sort of banging/building going on in a room on our floor''Rooftop restaurant'' a building site, did get a tea and sat on dusty chair! View goodBIG DOWN SIDE - when we came to check out, they tried to charge us again, they claimed we were checking out after 12 - no we said, we're not due to leave till tomorrow, we are checking out early. Then it was, 'where is your voucher?' we gave it you this am, we said. They said they couldnt find it, although didnt really look for it and wanted to charge us again. Fortunately we had a second invoice, though not strictly the voucher and they copied this and let us go. Surely they must have a system, ie they dont let you in your room without the voucher, It is my personal opinion that this is a deliberate scam. "
ajanta hotel ,"Average We stayed in a presidential suite for 4 nights. The rooms are a good size, the bed is comfy and the shower is fab. You have to accept that Delhi is noisy and the rooms are not soundproofed. We only used the hotel as a base and it is central. The room was never cleaned over 4 days, but this is India! We chose not to use the hotel's travel agency finding much cheaper deals elsewhere. They did'nt appreciate this and tried to cancel our room, but we had the confirmation and they let us stay. Because of that we chose to stay in a different hotel on our return. I would stay there again and it is a fair price. The hotel pickup was fine, but they quote $20 for return to airport. Taxi's charge 400 rupee's for the journey! £5 or $10. We chose a taxi! "
ajanta hotel ,"Terrible Hotel Please note: This hotel is advertised as New Delhi but is actually in Old Delhi.We stayed at the Ajanta Hotel for a total of five nights in early February 2006. It was our first stop on our round the world trip. We were picked up ok at the airport and immediately shepherded into the travel agency by Mrs. Shah who dove straight into her 'hard sell'. Before we knew it she had charged our credit card with 47,000 INR for a trip to Jaipur &amp; Agra that should have cost about 20,000 INR. We argued that she'd ripped us off and she gave us 20,000 INR cash back and a further 7,000 INR when we argued more with her. Despite the rocky start, we were determined to enjoy our time in this beautiful country and had two really nice days in and around Delhi with our friendly, honest driver. He tried to take us to some emporiums but we stood firm and told him that we weren't interested. He was totally ok with it and we gave him a 100 INR tip and he seemed much happier with that.Our trip to Jaipur and Agra was great and both hotels (especially Jaipur) were nice with clean rooms and good food. Of course we came into contact with scammers but the best way to deal with them when they ask you if it's your first time in India is to say 'No'. They usually back off if you are firm with them.When we returned to Delhi we had the same rubbish from the staff of the Ajanta but just ignored it and ate in other places and hailed our own rickshaws (really easy, just raise your hand at the roadside and about fifty of them race towards you!).All in all, India is an amazing place, but if you're in Delhi maybe consider staying somewhere else. "
ajanta hotel ,"Basic but OK Our first impression was that the place and especially the street it was situated in looked seedy. The room looked somewhat tired, there was a lot of noise from the street, and a family of pigeons had made the air conditioner their nest. Apart from that, though, the room was clean, the shower powerful and warm, the bed comfortable. Breakfast at the resturant was pretty good, dinner not so good.The hotel taxi service was very good and on the first morning, one of their in-house travel agents cornered us to ask if we'd planned the rest of our two week stay in India. We decided to hear him out as he proposed an itinerary around Rajasthan for us. Since the itinerary and price sounded reasonable, we decided to go for it. It turned out to be two of the best weeks we've ever had!We had one more day at Hotel Ajanta at the end of our holiday and stayed in the same room. Somehow, the standard seemed a lot higher and the room a lot quieter than the first stay. I think after spending two weeks in India, we'd just gotten used to what seemed noisy and chaotic at first. "
ajanta hotel ,"trap trap trap When we arrived at the airport there was no pick up service, we had to call the hotel to send a driver who was supposed to be there in 5 minutes which ended up being 2hrs. The hotel is situated in a very busy and unpleasant part of town. Although the hotel itself does not reflect the outside there were plenty of blemishes: we had to pay for the supposed complimentary driver plus the expected tip. we were then escorted directly into a travel agent room instead of check in where he proceeded to rip us off by offering outlandish prices for tours and cars. The staff expected a tip for everything (Including pointing to your room even though you already know where it is). The advertised Wi fi did not work and i heard it still wasnt working after a week. The internet was slow and did not work most of the time which frustrated the tourists there, that and the fact that they still expected you to pay for the internet that didnt work. The exchange did not have enough INR for 6000. If you are hiring a driver be aware that they will take you to emporium after emporium and if you have any specialised shopping (in our case it was a camera) they will not take you to the cheaper government stores but to the more expensive stores where thay have commision. You will save a lot of money by catching auto rickshaws and getting around on your own. Although the rickshaw drivers do exactly the same thing if you are firm they will know not to muck you around. We made friends with our driver and established a quick understanding which saved us a lot of money and time. This hotel like others i suppose, will at any cost milk tourists for their money. Although it is nice be warned, be aware and remember that doing all your travelling arrangements is possible even though the travel agent will say that it is not!! the food is good and the superior and supposed presidential suites are good (dont expect a great view like the net shows) but anything under these are very basic. Hope this helps especially the first timers to india... "
ajanta hotel ,"Dirty noisy expensive Dirty bathroom (hairs on the floor); noisy (carpentry going on at 9.30 pm); and expensive (I estimate 500 rupees' worth of hotel for 1200 rupees). I complained about the noise and was offered a single next to the carpenters for the same price. Sour staff and expensive shuttle (not free, as indicated on their web deals). Would not negoitate, although I mentioned their web prices. "
ajanta hotel ,"Avoid This Place !! - A lot of rooms have no window- Room rates are far too high for he rooms and service provided- We paid rooms in advance but when we arrived one room had been given to someone else so that one person in our group of 3 had to stay in another hotel which was even worse.- They tried to cheat us with the tax by trying to charge a tax on the rooms which is only applicable on food and beverages- Bed sheets were dirty and seemed not to be changed after each guest.- Roof top terrace is a place where they dump rubbish and old furniture, can’t be used to sit- We saw many other people complaining about the rooms, cleanliness and prices during our stay.- The attached travel agency is very aggressive and trying to sell their tours which are heavily overpriced. Usually people arriving in the hotel will be asked to come to the travel office straight away. We asked them to quote for a 3 days tour and got it for one third of the price somewhere else later. DO NOT BUY TOURS AT THIS PLACE!!!- I can clearly say that I am not going to put a foot again into this hotel and can only recommend avoiding staying there. "
ajanta hotel ,"Not great I think the only way to describe this hotel is disappointing.The room we stayed in was reasonably sized with a comfy bed, but wasn't particularly clean and the shower is best described as a lukewarm drizzle.The food in the restaurant is very tasty and reasonably priced.The location is handy for the train station but is a bit seedy and very noisy (but then this is Delhi so that's not too surprising).The worst part in this hotel is the constant hassle. The manager/travel agent is constantly trying to sell you tours, train tickets etc. At first it's not a problem but he carries on asking everytime he spots you, including when you're having a meal and it starts to get quite annoying. "
ajanta hotel ,"Tower of Terror! We stayed here for 2 nights, 11th &amp; 12th December was meant to stay another night but didn't, read on and you will understand why!!Positive Location is only a 5min walk to New Delhi Train Station perfect for the early morning train to Agra Cantt station to see the Taj Mahal! (if you want any hints or tips on how to do it yourself don't hesitate to contact me).excellent free transfer from airport to hotel, took about 40 mins but this was in rush hour. Room 206 - massive bathroom and clean. TV, air-con (not needed in December), cheap mini-bar, hard bed (our preference). Restaurant served nice &amp; reasonable food however, if you don't like your meat on the bone then go vegetarian! No beer served in the restaurant but you can go up to the roof terrace and get a Kingfisher beer.NegativesNot enough toilet paper, I know it seem petty but why should you have to tip someone just to get the basics? The same went for towels. Why clean the bathroom and take away your dirty towels but not replace them unless you give them money?As I said earlier the food was nice in the restaurant, however the constant harressment from the waiters and manager meant that you could not enjoy your food! Also be aware of your meat on the bone, they use every part!No hot water at all on our last morning and when I went to speak to the manager he just ignored me and shrugged his shoulders when I asked if the water would come back on. This was the worst, constant building work on the 2nd floor - I mean all through the night. I think it actually started about 1am, you could actually taste the dust! It felt like they were building next door! When I went to reception and asked to be moved the manager again just ignored me. I had enough at this point and left, when we checked out my partner went over to speak to the manager who just stared at us and didn't say anything!I know that it's all down to personal choice but please do not stay in this hotel but if you do, good luck!!For our last night we stayed at the Hotel Palace Heights in Connaught Place. Please see review. "
ajanta hotel ,"Room cleaning optional! Funny place - I've stayed in literally hundreds of hotels over the years, and this is one of the strangest. First of all, they don't automatically clean the room everyday - you have to request it! Secondly, they were renovating the rooms next door - till 4 in the morning! ... see photo. No amount of complaining made any difference. Although its close to the railway station, its very hard to find, and the website gives very poor directions.On the plus side, its friendly, reasonably clean and has a good internet cafe.The best thing,though, is the travel agency which the hotel operates. Mr Kamal Gupta helped me organise a trip up to Haridwar on the Ganges, which was very well run - and he suggested an excellent hotel. Thanks Kamal, you stopped the Ajanta from being a terrible disappointment. "
ajanta hotel ,"Do not trust the travel agency! We booked a hotel in Goa with the travel agency in the hotel. When we arrived in Goa, the hotel was disgusting, linen stained and unclean, swimming pool so unclean, couldn't see the steps, let alone the bottom.So, we called Ajanta to ask if we could get a refund, he said yes over the phone.....a month later, we are still trying to get a refund. We have emailed and called countless times and still no refund. We also found out since he was making 50% commission PER NIGHT on our booking.The hotel was not great either, poor location and our room had no windows! "
ajanta hotel ,"Grand little place if they cleaned up stayed here for a weekend,first room was on the 2nd floor beside some building site, very noisy and dusty, when i asked to be moved they reluctantly did so, to a far superior room on the 4th floor. It's in a noisy area and there is an open air venue right outside to the left of the hotel. The whole area is quite lively actually and this adds to the rough around the edges charmof the place.Staff are pretty gruff, but that didn't really bother me, just don't tip in those circumstances. The restaurant served lovely well priced food, and there were locals as well as tourists in the restaurant which is a good sign. It's reasonably priced if you are on a budget,with comp pickup from the airport and they also arrange trips to Agra and beyond.If only i was convinced that my bed had been made with clean sheets the first day and if only they had bothered to service my room the second day i would have said above average! "
ajanta hotel ,"Good travel agency! The hotel is okay and recommended for short stays in Delhi however it is situated in an crowded an noisy area.I found hotel's travel agency very helpful due to it's capable, experienced and friendly travel agent Mr. Kamal! "
ajanta hotel ,"It was an experience that I will always remeber fondly Frome the very first moment we walked into the Hotel we knew that we were going to come back again and again. We have never felt so at home and comfortable at any other establishment. From the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff, everyone was very pleasent, helpful and warm. I would surely recomend this hotel to any of my freinds and family. "
ajanta hotel ,"Fawlty Towers of India! I rate this as &quot;terrible&quot; because it was...er...terrible! Actually, Ithink the hotel is perfectly comfortable in a seedy, old colonial yetbohemian sort of way. It has one lift which I wouldn't trust to be infor more than 2 minutes, a concierge on every level who likes to knowexactly what you are doing and how many tips he can make from you in any one conversation and who'll report you falsely to the boss for trying to give you own clothes to local builders. Hot water was intermittent. Creepy managers near reception loiter to ask how you are doing only as a foil to get you to use their restaurant, their taxi services, their facilities. However, once you tell them you are leaving or are not pleased with certain aspects, they drop you like a dead donkey to fend for yourself. That said, their restaurant is pretty good and certainly convenient and their rooms fairly clean, although we slept in our own bed covers as the dirty marks on the sheets looked suspect. The most disturbing creepiness of all though was when a manager came to us on our first night as we were about to sample the delights of the street informed us that at night the road was not safe from muggers and thieves. I felt this was a strange, overkill way of getting us to use their restaurant. When we booked a second night (for convenience) they had hiked the Expedia price by more than double. If you like quirky, creepy, soiled and disingenuous, this is the place for you. What Expedia are doing to team up with these people is beyond me! "
ajanta hotel ,"Decent Hotel The hotel was nicer than expected. The rooms were basic but fine for the price. Our room had a balcony which was great to see the hustle and bustle down below us. Was a little noisy at times, but that's expected in the city! :o) The restaurant food was delicious and all staff very helpful. It was also convenient having internet access onsite. Overall, I would stay there again as the location is great (not too far from Connaught street in Tuk Tuk). "
ajanta hotel ,Great place to stay in Delhi Firstly the location is just excellent. It is in the heart of the city and accessible to shooping and sight seeing districts.Next is the pricing. Real value for money. But I do not mean that is is devoid of luxury and amenities. Its a clean and confortable placeStaff is courteous and the over all stay was a rather pleasant one 
ajanta hotel ,"Decent hotel terrible surroundings This is a relatively clean and organized place, but is located in a chaotic area near the New Delhi railway station. Be aware of touts waiting right outside the door!The restaurant offers decent food and there seemed to be a crowd of other tourists. Prices are fair, but if you dont have a booking, negotiate before accepting their offer. "
ajanta hotel ,"Over-rated Hoax!! Noting the pretty decent reviews about this place, my friends &amp; I had the unfortunate 'luxury' of staying at this hotel. The airport pickup was on time. Checking in past midnight was almost a nightmare... Save that we were not in mood to argue with Jetlag setting in. The rooms given us were probably not cleaned in the last month. (and those sheets- ugh!) Especially the toilet. If it wasnt for the ungodly hour we landed there, we would have just picked up our bags and walked down the street in search of another place. (there are plenty of them on this street) The surrounding area is vibrant and full of life, though the dust and noise intermingles.The guys at the counter tried their best to rip us off at every turn, and I can only imagine how some of those 'good' reviews have appeared. The next day checked out, despite their attempts to intimidate us... and found a nice, clean place just down the street called Godwin at a much lesser tag. "
ajanta hotel ,"Horrible experience! The rooms are not very clean and our air condition was so noisy it was difficult to go to sleep. I would never stay here again! and would recommend everybody else to stay away. There are so many better places on the same road.This is not a hotel but a travel agent! We arrived with a late flight from London and all the hotel was interested in when we arrived was to sell us one of their trips. Since it was our first night we thought we should be polite and listen even though we had made our own arrangements before leaving home. We were told that the route we had planning was stupid and that a stretch we wanted to take the train was impossible - although we actually had a ticket for it and the train was definitely running. We had booked a car to pick us up the next morning to go to Agra. We were again told in a rather aggressive way that it was ridicolous for a car to come from agra to pick us up to then drive back to agra, the only way sesnible to do this was to drive from delhi to agra and back to delhi... Further the hotel made every effort for our driver not to find us and when he asked fo us they even said there were nobody with that name staying at this hotel. There are so many other places to stay in Delhi, pick any of them just not this one! "
ajanta hotel ,"Tour operator After to have read positive comments on this website, we decided to book for 2 nights in this hotel.According to the quality of the facilities offered by the hotel, the price for a room is expensive. Moreover, on the spot, we booked a 13-days trip with the tour operator of the hotel Ajanta. We were very disappointed by the gap between the initial prestations presented to sell the trip and the real quality of the activities and the hotels. We paid indeed an expensive price to get air cond and hot water in each hotel, and it was not the case for many nights. In addition, we booked for a camel ride in a desert with a &quot;wonderful&quot; night under a big tent in the desert with local dances and a huge diner ... but once in the desert, the guy in charge of this activity explained us that it is not possible to sleep under a tent and he never heard about these local dances ... We decided to cancel the remaining days of our trip to go back in Delhi in to discuss &quot;hardly&quot; with the hotel Ajanta to refund money back. We are very angry to have paid an expensive price for bad prestation and, finally, to get bad holidays. "
ajanta hotel ,"OVER RATED!!! trust me..its crap for the price Ok, I read the reviews about this place and took it for granted. Its not a bad place...but NOT worth the price. I went to stay there for 4 nites but only stayed for 2 becuse there are better hotels along that streach for much cheaper and better quality. I stayed at the Godwin. Much better. Food was excellent and the servious was fabulous. Ajanta didnt even change the sheets. ITS CRAP! absolutly OVERATED...Dont fall for the pics on the web site....just Trust me.They also try to cheat you if you check in at mid nite onwards...they no you are tired and try to manupulate (Just as the previous reviews stayted...they charged me extra TAX after confirming one rate and wanted full payment upfront. (Do not fall for this). there is no such thing as paying full payment upfront.Overall its an ok place, the airport pick was on time....BUT it is absolutly NOT worth the price when you compare the hotels around that place. I will never book the place or recommned it to anyone. NO WAY!! they are over priced, even if you think its cheap. If you are not convinced...stay there one night and then walk around and ask the hotels around you...check out the rates and the rooms...I bet you will check out the next morning! Good luck! "
ajanta hotel ,"Terrible place - bad experience Our stay at Hotel Ajanta just went from good to bad to worse in the three days we stayed there. Here is an account of what happened. We had a reconfirmation (not just confirmation) from their reservation agent before May 1st regarding our booking. But when we arrived on May 1 at 2 pm at Hotel Ajanta, they had no idea about our booking. Our name did not show up in their list or anywhere else. So, they took us in as a walk-in customer. They promptly went into their marketing gimmick of showing us a really small room first and then a larger family room (Room 416) which was available on discount that day. The rate was Rs. 1500 in place of their regular Rs. 1800. We accepted it and took the room. The room was nice and I have no complaints about this room for the price we were offered. However, later on they must have checked with their agent and found out that the accepted rate between us was Rs. 1575. So, they charged Rs. 1575 to us the next day which was fine for me as that was the contracted rate. Their rate fluctuates depending on circumstance and the person in front of them - that is dynamic pricing for you.We then left for Agra the next day (May 2) with our baggage left at the hotel saying that we were coming back in a day to stay at the hotel again as per my reservation with the agent. The manager at the reception (Mr. Kaushal) gave me his contact numbers and said I should confirm with them before I leave Agra so that they can keep a room for us. I did so at 12 noon on May 3 by making a call from Agra and letting them know that we were arriving at 11 pm. Obviously their processes are not in tune with the needs of the travellers of today. So, when we arrived at 11 pm, there were no rooms for us and most were already booked. So, they sent us to a room (Room 402) which was a suite with inadequate bedding for the four of us but large open spaces. Seeing the room I knew that the room would cost a lot more than Rs.1575. They did not mention the rate to us while sending us there anyways. When I called them up to enquire about the rate for the room they said it will cost me Rs. 4000 for one night (again at a discount of course as it is usually priced at Rs. 4500). This was not acceptable to me and they reduced it to Rs. 3000. Finally after some haggling and fighting in the middle of the night they agreed to let us stay in the room for Rs. 1575 for one night. The next morning we had to pack our bags and keep it ready so they could move us to another appropriate room since this suite was at our disposal only for one night. We packed our bags and left them there and went for the sight seeing tour which we had booked through the travel agent who sits at the counter at the same hotel (the sight seeing trip was another disappointment which I do not intend to describe). When we came back tired at about 9 pm that night, we had no room again and our bags were still sitting in the same place where we left them in the morning. I argued with the guy at the counter about the reservation and our experience of the previous day etc. . Finally, he gave me a family room for that night (Room 316) which I thought would be similar to the first room we got and liked, but it was not so. It had fewer beds and less moving space. They said they would charge us extra if we wanted extra beds and so we decided to adjust with what we had. And then to our horror, we found that the cold water taps in the bathroom were dry. All we had was hot water from the taps. We were too tired to argue or get anything done as it was already late, so we just grinned and bore it. We resolved not to return to this hotel ever again in our lives. Moral of the story: Hotels like these are not tuned to taking care of modern day travellers. Indian budget hotels have not grown up with the times where reservations are honoured. They do not take advance payments (I asked the agent about making payments in advance and she said I need not worry only that I should just show up). They are only tailored to take in walk-in customers. So, you better show up between 12 noon and 4 pm and you might have options to get a good room. After that, they will just chuck you into any room and charge you whatever they want, reservations be damned. I do not know how they got listed on Lonely Planet and otehr publications.....I did see a number of non-Indians who had checked in thinking this is a great place. I am not sure if they are treated any better (reverse discrimination....) Regards Jay "
ajanta hotel ,"Good for the Price This place was a pleasant suprise, I have to say. Everyone says Delhi is a nightmare with hotels and to be honest this was good at a good price.Room was nice. View was not so good but I wasn't for sitting in my room gazing at any view so that was fine. The bed was comfortable. There was a mini-bar, which I think the prices were fine. It had chocolate too. Television was fine- medium sized.Location is good. 5 minute autorickshaw from Connaught Place. I liked the area. It's a bit dingy but the energy was good. Such a stretch of hotels on the street, a row of neon. Found it nice to breeze through. A lot of people complained that it was dirty. It was a bit but the energy was generally good. Some stores nearby were grand too. There was a market nearby where there was a random security entrance unplugged and planked in the middle of the road. Strange looking thing.Restaurant on the ground floor was another surprise. They had a nice buffet and I liked the way they kind of replaced rice with porridge flakes in a curried pea dish. Very subtle and tasty. The evening meal was also nice. Actually had a pizza here that was a delight. Chai was lovely. It appeared to do a good trade too, which was encouraging.Each floor had a hall monitor type guy who ran to you when you moved. This was helpful but a bit crowding. The staff were fine but there was a lot of drama and theater with receipts and everything really. You stood there as they started to lose their heads over a simple request you made. Sometimes they just chased you shouting questions. They were good natured for the most part though.I can see why some people were a bit wary of the travel agency. We got the pitch there, well actually we didn't. They bring you in and make a fuss of you and then get mad as hell when you don't want their services even though you're upfront from the start. This is a bit of a turn off. Some prices quoted to us seemed to be really excessive based on us looking them up afterwards. But we didn't book anything so we have no need to complain about being burned. Be a bit careful with this one though.Also, when you get there shop around the rooms because the condition varies wildly. We visited a person we had met in Jaipur in their back room and it was something else. There was a full scale construction thing going on outside and I'm not talking that the noise was near. The construction was right there. If you put your hand out the window you could have gotten your hand crushed by some kinda hydrolic shaft thing. There was a backdoor to the room that was not the most secure thing. Therefore be very careful in choosing wisely. The computer room was great and fast. The taxi service as good. We got a good price to the airport compared to the fleecing we had gotten from someone else in another direction.Thanks to Lonely Planet washing their hands of the hotels and inns in Delhi in general our expecations were low and we found that this place was fine really. The staff were a bit hyperactive but if you insist on picking a good room it's a good choice really. "
ajanta hotel ,"The Ajanta is trying hard I stayed here about 15 years ago and it was a dump. In March 2007 I found it changed almost beyond recognition. They are obviously trying hard to capture the tourist market. The airport pick up worked perfectly on both occasions I used it. Front rooms with windows can be incredibly noisy - ask for a change. Many rooms have, in effect, no windows but they are very clean and well maintained. The restaurant is very good and can get crowded. At present a lot of work is going on within the hotel and this can cause noise and disruption - and they need to get the lift upgraded! All the front of house services worked well. Room service could be slow but it was ok. The staff are pleasant and helpful. So far as I know you are not going to do better, for the price, in Delhi. "
ajanta hotel ,"Great hotel in a not great location This hotel was not my first choice, but the first choice was booked. That said, it turned out to be better than I expected and we stayed there twice for a total of 5 nights. It is family run and there are lots of people in the lobby waiting to help you. The hall porter on each floor is also eager to help: he is your main contact for anything you need, from room service to laundry. It is very clean and well decorated: exterior rooms have lots of sun and marble floors (and street noise). Interior rooms have no windows and wall-to-wall carpeting, and they are quiet. It also has a restaurant with a good breakfast buffet and the butter chicken at dinner is excellent. This hotel also has a travel agency on the premises that operates on the &quot;strong arm&quot; sales approach. While you may not like their sales style, the travel agency is reputable and can help you plan and book your travel throughout India.We used them with no problems. We also liked the hotel Internet room - about 8 computers with good connections at a very good price. One caveat: this hotel is a short walk from the train station and the neighborhood is congested, dirty, and noisy. But once you're in the hotel, it feels like an oasis. "
ajanta hotel ,"Only prepay if turning up early to ensure decent room We read the good reviews for this hotel and thought it sounded pretty reasonable, but when we turned up at 4am (admittedly a few hours late) for our room which we had prepaid for, they must have given us the worst room in the place. There was a wooden board in replacement for the window, dirty pillow cases, hole-in-the-floor toilet and manky bathroom. It looks like we were in the only part of the hotel that hadn't been refurbished. However we only had to stay for 2 hours before catching our train at New Delhi (only 30R in a tuktuk to reach). The best thing about this hotel for us was that we were able to prebook all our train tickets and pick them up before moving on which was really handy. Moral of the story, if you turn up late having prepaid - toughluck, you get what you're given! I would go back but only if I could see the room before paying and ensure a refurbished one. "
ajanta hotel ,"Over-priced We stayed here for 3 nights in December (2006), We arrived late and had arranged an airport pick up, but once we arrived at the hotel desperate for some sleep we were left in one of the side rooms while the check in staff stood around and talked, we were then given a talk about the services offered by the hotel, when we declined we were finally shown to our rooms.The room was clean and functionaly, though there was erratic hot water in the bathroom.The staff were of limited help and seemed more interested in offering paid services rather than giving helpful advice (They also have a member of staff on each floor who each time you go back tries to escort you to your room and expects a tip - we ended up trying to tip toe back to our room to avoid this)Dont use the pre paid taxi booth in the reception - this is vastly over pricved, go outside and get an autrickshaw (the pre pay booth charged us 100 ruppees to the train station, the autorickshaw was 20 and its only a 10 min walk away)One very positive point is the roof top restaurant. The food was fantastic, the staff friendly and very helpful and the value was tremendous.Overall, there are many better and substantially cheaper places in Delhi "
ajanta hotel ,"Okay but depends on what you pay. Stayed at the Hotel Ajanta in November of 2006. Our airport pickup was there at 4am when we arrived, but when we checked in we were given standard rooms (no windows, no working air conditioning, barely functioning toilet and broken locks on the doors) instead of what we had reserved. As promised they gave us their 'best' rooms the next day, which they call 'presidential suites' but which are really just rooms where everything works. We were in town on business so we irked them when we said we had no need for any of their tour arrangements. I once overheard the matriarch of the hotel trying to convince a Swiss couple not to take another tour by a different company because it was run by 'untrustworthy Kashmiri's'. In India you have to take spruiking for granted but the Hotel Ajanta does take it to another level.They won't clean your room unless you leave them your room key. The risk with that is that you may not have a room left by the time you return to collect it again. Do so at your own risk. The internet cafe is functional and probably the best on the street, though the guy who runs it is always trying to screw you. The Hotel Ajanta is a standard experience for those looking for budget hotels in Delhi, so if you're looking for a more relaxed, comfortable stay, perhaps try somewhere else. Being in the thick of things at the Hotel Ajanta might be something you'd prefer to avoid. Delhi is full on as it is, and someplace like the Taj Ambassador Hotel might be more to your liking.Still, it wasn't a completely negative experience - breakfast is decent for what you pay, but avoid having lunch or dinner there. Guaranteed food poisoning.Avoid, if possible. "
ajanta hotel ,"Not a good choice We stayed in Ajanta with my s.o. in the beginning of November ´06. We definetly are not picky, but this time the hotel really managed to disapoint us.We arrived late at night and were given a small room with no windows and two beds instead of double bed - not what we had ordered and paid beforehand, and definetly not what we had seen in the pictures on hotels website. After a moan we were given a new room, which did have a double bed, but where there was only boiling hot water in the shower and where the toilet didn't flush. We complained again and were given the first, small and dirty, room again, for there were no other rooms available. Next day we moved again, this time to another room with a double bed. There were windows - which gave to the hallway! The personell started to work there every morning at 6.30, and as they were very loud and the walls did not stop the sound at all, we simply could not sleep. The bathroom was uncomfortable and infested by insects.Our room was cleaned only after I asked for it for the second time. Not one of the rooms had sheets until we asked the personell to bring them. This repeated every day. All the towels were dirty - really, all of them, also after we had asked for new ones.The personell didn't seem to care about us - they didn't, for excample, apologise once during the late night when we moved from one room to another and back again. It seems they simply don't have to do that - they had the hotel booked full anyway. Something positive? My mother, who stayed in Ajanta couple of days before us, was treated decently and transferred to an ok room, but only after two days of hardcore tipping.The location was ok.Summary: unclean, noisy hotel, where we felt ourselves not wanted. Could serve as a one star -hostel, but definetly not worth the price. "
ajanta hotel ,"Good value if you don't mind being in the thick of it This Hotel is above average because it is good value. We stayed in a semi businessness room for 1,300 Indian Rupees per night including a decent breakfast. The room was big with a lounge, coffee table and desk. With good light and an ok bathroom which was clean. A basic clean place with a roof top restaurant. It is in old Delhi so it is a bit full on as soon as you leave the hotel "
ajanta hotel ,"Vey disappointing My partner and I stayed here for 3 and 2 nights in Sept/Oct '06 at the start and end of our holiday having booked via Hotel Club in June.Although we had paid for a superior twin, initially we were assigned a tiny room with no windows. After a moan we were given a better room with a shared balcony.The lavatory would not flush and despite many requests to get it fixed nothing happened and for two days we were obliged to flush it using buckets filled in the bath. The bathroom had a wooden louvered window which could not be closed. Overnight the bathroom was infested by insects which totally covered every horizontal surface.The air conditioner tripped about every couple of hours and each time we had to seek out someone to reset the trip. This was a common problem with all three of the rooms we had.After a further round of complaints we were moved to another room where at least the lavatory worked.We did not receive the ‘hard sell’ from the Travel Office and in general the staff were friendly but just hopeless. We witnessed several disputes at Reception one so severe that we were moved to an office to complete our check in. The Buffet breakfast in the dinning room was stone cold even at 09.00.Ignore the lovely pics of the roof top restaurant, it is a tip and apparently used for storing junk. There is, however, a sign stating that you can have a coke and a pizza for about a quid.On the whole very disappointing and by far the worst hotel we stayed at during out two week visit and by no means the least expensive.I believe that ‘The Rough Guide’ should review their recommendation which is prominently displayed all over the Hotel. "
ajanta hotel ,"Ok go for it The place is not bad after all. I guess it depends on the room you get.We booked the 1st night through expedia and where charged 23 euro. The room (was spacious and with a nice bathroom but no aircon. Very noisy due to the street.The price would not go down, so we asked another room and we got a smaller one (218) with aircon, for 900 (16 euro) which I thought was better. No idea why the other one is more expensive.The restaurant is great value, the lady of the travel agency is nice but asks you all the time what are your plans, a bit pushy.The room service is fast and does not overcharge, so you can ask for a tea and get it in 5 minutes for 22 rp (0,40 euro cents).I checked some hotels in the area and this is the average, maybe even a bit better.They all loook great from the reception and then it goes down once you are in the rooms. "
ajanta hotel ,"Skip the in-house travel agent! Good room, but wasn't fully clean when we arrived. Short walk to New Dehli railway station (7 minutes), but a fair step to Connaught Place (15 minutes). Reasonably priced restaurant with good food. Reliable internet and phone service. Only real downside was the pushy guy in the travel agent who offered us a vastly overpriced trip and then became unhelpful once we said no. "
ajanta hotel ,"Avoid in Summer On arrival everything seemed ok, but on entry to the rooms they seemed to be falling apart. We stayed for 4 nights, not all consecutively and eventually hadto change because of the poor quality. If you pay budget you get budget. Our stay was in June when the weather is hot. The a/c cuts out everyday between 6pm and 9pm. The rooms have fridges, which seem to be ornamental, they didnt fucntion!! The lift did not work alot of the time. Location is right in the centre with all the hustle and bustle so do not expect peace. Restaurant Service extremely slow. It took the waiters around 10 minutes just to give us the bill! Each floor has a janitor, they were the only pleasant things about our stay at the hotel. Very hard working and will attend to all your requests (apart from gettin the ac working). When we made our complaints no discounts were given, instead a 'deluxe room' was offered at the same price which had exactly the same facilites as the standard rooms, including a non functioning fridge and non functioning air con. "
ajanta hotel ,"Noisy Poor Service Avoid it very noisy, could not sleep at all, ordered eggs, came with shells, just avoid this hotel and as always look at the room before you buy. "
ajanta hotel ,"Awful ! ABSOLUTELY avoid this hotel : dirty, expensive, very unpleasant people, we are furious, we paid a lot and in advance, and our rooms had been given to somebody else when we came back from a trip to Udaipur. They invented an incredible lie to justify it, and were very unpleasant with us. You have to ask for your room to be cleaned up, (and just forget it for the bath), we asked for a presidential suite and had one big and one little bed, without any fruit basket, people always ask for money, we stayed blocked in the lift, we were given wrong hour for the plane trip and waited 4 hours in the airport to go to Udaipur, etc, etc). "
ajanta hotel ,"the ajanta trap con merchants seems an adequate description , the rooms are clean by indian standards , the so called free airport pick up seems to be a downright lie , you will be prssured to take out a tour to the golden triangle and the management will sulk if you dont book it...the staffa are at best indifferent and at wost rude....the floor staff will talk loudly all night just outside your room and will take every opportunity to ingratiate themselves , without actually being of any help.your room may well smell of some weird chemical that i presume they use to kill bugs...you can get much better much cheaper in delhiso my advice would be book a room for one night then move on and watch the management sulk...sorry ajanta but we customers are important and very few of us are millionaires , hard to descrbe how unwelcoming the staff are undernath their smug exteriors , incidentally keep your eye on the email man who will make sure you spend the maximum amount , take a usb if you need one and use the small intenet caff across the road which is half price and friendlyish. "
ajanta hotel ,"Stay clear of these con artists!!!!!!! Stay clear of these con artists!!!!!!!Do not make the mistake I did and stay in this hotel only because it has a website. There's far better options out there. This is how they operate. You book online thinking that this will be a great place to stay after seeing the pictures on their website. When you get there you're not allowed to have a look at the room before but you have to sit down and talk to the incredibly pushy sales woman who's trying to sell you one of their tours. You have to be really firm here as she will not give up very easily. We we're not interested at all in any of there tours as we'd come to India for a friends wedding and to see India on our own in our own time. She stopped smiling when she found out that we weren't interested. She took us out to the reception and said something in hindi to the receptionist sounding very annoyed. Probably because she didn't get us into booking a tour. Before leaving UK, we had booked the second most expensive room at hotel Ajanta thinking this would be one of the nicer room among their pictures on their website. However, as we didn't buy a tour they were't interested in giving us a nice room or providing us with good customer service. They claimed that the dirty room we were given was the room we had paid for. So, if you intend to buy a tour with these guys then you might find this hotel ok (but still overpriced) as they will give you the better room and suck up to you. But if you;re no interested in tours...STAY CLEAR OF THIS DUMP. I discovered a great place on my second trip to Delhi. It came recomended from other travelers I met. It's called &quot;Cottage, Yes Please&quot; and is located in the same area as Hotel Ajanata. It's very close to the cinema. We got a spotless room for 600 R. "
ajanta hotel ,"Terrible Dont make the mistake of booking your first few nights in Delhi at this place simply because its one of the only budget places to have a website! Rooms nothing like the pictures, payed over twice the price of similar style rooms you could get elsewhere. Dirty shower and toilet etc etc. Fair enough the airport pick up is handy and free., but this is more than made up for by the high room rates you pay. Just get a taxi and have a look around a popular central area in Delhi and youll find something better - i did this the second time i came to delhi a month later (after a long flight) and found something better for half the price - namely - 'cottage yes please' strange name i know but good. "
ajanta hotel ,"Do not trust the Lonely Planet's recommendation for Hotel Ajanta!! Like many others, I was duped into booking with the Hotel Ajanta because of the Lonely Planet's recommendation.What a mistake!!First, keep in mind that to secure a reservation on-line, the hotel charges you in advance for the room. You can imagine my surprise when I was met at the Delhi airport for pick-up an hour late, and then kindly informed upon arriving at the Hotel Ajanta that they had given my room (that I had already paid for in full) to another, but that they had a room for me in their &quot;sister&quot; hotel down the dumpy street.Unfortunately, the &quot;sister&quot; hotel insisted on being paid for the room separately, and did not appear to know much about its &quot;brother&quot; hotel (the Hotel Ajanta) up the road. When I complained about this the following morning at the Hotel Ajanta desk, they refused to refund my money for the Hotel Ajanta booking, and offered me their wretched breakfast instead.Second, after this awful experience, I proceeded to cancel other reservations I had made with Hotel Ajanta for later in my India trip. Although Hotel Ajanta has been assuring me for the last 40 days with multiple e-mails that they have processed my refund for these later nights, I have yet to receive a refund, and have had to turn directly to my credit card company for assistance. The bottom line is that Hotel Ajanta knows very well how to take your money and charge your card, but God forbid they give it back to you, even when they have agreed in writing to do so!If you believe that frustration, wasted time, and broken promises are part of any India experience, knock yourself out and stay at the Hotel Ajanta. I never will. "
ajanta hotel ,"Good hotel seedy area I stayed at this hotel with my son in January. After having read more than 30 reviews, with such variable responses, I was a little cautious. Many reviewers were angry at the aggressive selling of tour packages. We arrived in the middle of the night, and I expected an aggressive sales routine, but there was none. The room was plain, reasonably clean and cheap (for Delhi). I booked on-line for $10 US. The staff was courteous and fairly efficient. I did get a sales promotion the next day, but after shopping around, found a better deal (but not hugely better). I simply declined, and that was the end. The restaurant was good, although the breakfast buffet was expensive, and it was much cheaper to simply order a parantha from the menu. I would recommend this hotel, but the surrounding area is quite dirty and possibly shocking for someone new to India. "
ajanta hotel ,"You get what you pay for I stayed at Hotel Ajanta this Feb 2006. Basically, you get what you pay for. The hotel is old but clean. The rooms are very basic but do have a television with cable. The hotel has a money changer, internet cafe, travel agent and a pretty good restaurant all under one roof. There were many foreign tourists there from all over the world who seemed pretty happy there. The one major drawback is the area in which the hotel is located which is Paharganj and is a total dump. However, the hotel will arrange a car/rickshaw for you to get you out of the area as easiliy as possible. I suggest taking your own blanket, soap, towel and an extra sheet if you are picky. These are things which will make your stay at this hotel more comfortable. If you can afford to stay in an area other than Paharganj I would do so because the rest of Dehli is actually very nice. But if you are on a budget, the Ajanta has a lot to offer.One more thing, if you do rent a car and driver from the hotel. Be firm with you driver. Our driver kept trying to take us to the &quot;Tourist&quot; shops (Cottage Industries, Gov't approved etc.) and these shops charge you more than double than the price in the markets. The driver pretty much refused to take us to any local markets without first having us waste our time at these &quot;gov't approved&quot; markets. Hope you have a great time in Delhi "
ajanta hotel ,"Ajanta Hotel -Nice but couple of things to watch out for My girlfriend and I stayed in the Ajanta hotel in Delhi in Jan 06. Its convenient for the station and sights of New and Old Delhi and a nice haven from the bustle of the Ram Nagar area outside, Food's OK - nothing spectacular, and they gave us a complimentary pick up from the airport. I would recommend it but watch out for a few things:1) Make sure the room you are given is the standard you have booked and are paying for. We got shown a &quot;nice quiet room&quot; (windowless) but which was clearly not the Semi Business Double we had booked and were quoted for.2) We did not use their travel agency services, but found them overly persistent and pressurising. They will try and catch you with your guard down when you check in and give you the hard sell before you get to see your room or key. Say no and demand your room NOW! They also used the old &quot;delhi isn't safe - you must book all your cars etc through us&quot; tactic. Good practice for the level of touting in India generally, but you could do without it from inside your hotel.3) When we left we booked a taxi (through the hotel's taxi desk) to take us to the airport and strangely found ourselves giving a lift to the hotel rep who was travelling to the airport to pick up some other newly arriving guests. This is how they afford to give complementary airport pick-ups - by getting departing guests to pay for the taxi. Dead cheeky! "
ajanta hotel ,"Nothing special but not expensive First, I really appreciated the free airport pickup.Second, the neighborhood leaves much to be desired. Granted, we were leaving from the nearby New Delhi train station the next day, so it was all we needed. Still, not a place I'd love to spend time in.The rooms were OK, especially given the price. I too was put off by the touting of tours -- especially during my phone call from the U.S. to book the room! "
ajanta hotel ,"Rude Management I had booked six rooms for myself &amp; my colleages. On arrival at the hotel, they didn't have the right rooms as we booked for and one of the room was not available for my friend. We had asked to see the owner/manager Mr Arya. When we confronted Mr Arya, he just ignored us &amp; didn't even bother to solve the problem of accomodating us. I think in view of attracting foreign customers through their joint travel agency service, the whole management of this hotel is terrible. The hotel is overpriced for the service it gives. Better off getting hotels (Godwin/Crystal/Yuvraj etc)nearby with better service &amp; cheaper. "
ajanta hotel ,"Can Not Trust The hotel staff taking my reservation on the phone was rude and sounding as if doing me a favour (ok, I can understand that a low-grade hotel cannot afford to hire polite staff). So far so good. Then he wanted to charge to me for my airport pickup request (their website says its free) so I declined the pickup. Inspite of offering my credit card details to confirm the reservation, he said will hold my reservation without the card details. I informed that I will check in after midnite.Upon reaching the hotel, I found the same staff who took my reservation on phone. First he declined he had any reservation in my name. When I insisted on seeing the reservation register and found my name in it, he gave the following assorted reasons for not having a room for me:1. You arrived late.2. Your reservation is for the following day, not today.3. You didn't use our airport pickup4. You didn't provide us with your card details.5. You didn't email to confirm the reservation.He offered to put me up in his friend's hotel next door (a shabby room at exorbitant price) for the night and move me into his property the following morning. As it was midnite, I reluctantly agreed. The next day he flatly refused to check me in at his property. I noticed that other guests at the hotel reception area were being treated extremely well and offered rooms. I was not because:1. I am not white skin2. I don't hold an American or European passport3. I was not going pay in dollars but in Indian rupees.Reserve your stay here at your own risk.Kumar3. "
ajanta hotel ,"You get what you pay for. There seems to be a lot of room for differences in quality of your stay here based on which room and/or floor you are on. My room was nothing great, but acceptably clean except for the serious musty smell of the mattress and curtains. My air con worked fine, but a woman on the 3rd floor (I was on the 2nd) said she had to choose between being very hot all night, or trying to sleep over the racket from her air conditioner. The airport pickup worked well, which is a big advantage. But I thought the onsite travel agency was a bit pushy. The restaurant was quite good, and reasonably priced. Overall, this is a decent deal for the money, especially in Delhi, where prices can be outrageous. Definitely ask to see the room before checking in, and don't be afraid to ask for another room if you don't like the first one you see. "
ajanta hotel ,Free Airport transfer close to Train Station We arrived in the middle of the night at Delhi airport and had a 7am train to the Punjab the following morning. We booked the hotel very easily on expedia and arranged a free hotel pick-up (not detailed on expedia but on their website). They were there waiting for us and took us safely to the Hotel (we therefore avoided the much commented on Delhi airport scrum of Taxi drivers). Given that we paid £27 for a room for 3 of us the pickup was worth that alone (it is a fair whack to the airport). We spent only about 4 hours in the hotel room which had no window but for somewhere clean to put our head and it was fine. Check in was fine and friendly. The station was an 'enlightening' 5-10 minute walk at 6am but being so close made catching the train very easy. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want somewhere to put your head on day one for an easy exit to the train station but not exactly the place to have a long relaxing holiday and I don't recognise the photo on expedia. The photo from the window posted on trip advisor is a good reflection of the neighborhood we saw. 
ajanta hotel ,"An OK hotel in one of the worst locations in Delhi We have just returned from a one week stay at the hotel. We had a windowless room that was passable. It's clean and decent. However, the staff walking the hallways are loud and disturb your sleep. The lobby is narrow and long and I guess because of construction, dining is also there.The staff at Hotel Ajanta tried to sell us overpriced packages to visit Jaipur and Agra and tried to convince us that this was a better deal. It's cheaper to take the Shatabdi express and do day trips to each city. There are a number of staff during the evening and it is fair to say, they all hover around you and some of them need to know your personal business, and your day plan.The Internet Café was perhaps one of the best facilities that the hotel offers. The location of the hotel is unfortunately unappealing. Outside, the street is filthy and narrow, packed with cars, rickshaws, vendors, taxi drivers and everything else imaginable. The staff is super-nice only when you do things their way, but don't be fooled. They're are there to take your money. Buyers beware!The room was clean and decent. Seeing the room for the first time, I was extremely pleased, especially since I feared the worst from its outside appearance. As they say, never judge a book by its cover. The service in the restaurant is extremely slow. My husband and I ordered at the same time. About ten minutes later, a couple arrived. It was ten minutes after everybody was served, that I received my order and by then the toast had turned into &quot;biscotti&quot;.Overall, I wouldn't not stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it. "
ajanta hotel ,"poor value We have been backpacking round India for over a month and got the Ajanta hotel from TripAdvisor. The room rates are variable, they charge what they like. The reception is pushy, they try to sell you a tour of Jaipur and Agras, as soon as you arrive, by taxi for 12000 rps for 2 people which is certainly not good value even with accomodation - you can do the round trip by train for just over 3000 + accomodation at 200-350 per night for decent places.The rooms are clean(ish) but a bit pokey and the shared toilets are dirty. The final nail in the coffin is the staff, one guy who always seemed to be hanging around just outside our door had the cheek to demand a tip for &quot;my good service&quot; when we were leaving despite the fact that he had done nothing more than say good morning to me!We have to go back through Delhi and we won't be staying here.

ajay guest house ,Dont bother! We paid for the best room ! - The electricity was constantly going off for long periods. OK this may be part of the Indian way but why advertise it as 24/7 electricity. Even when the electricity was on the shower NEVER worked - not good for the price of the room!!it was dirty and grubbyThe staff were unfriendly and rude.The only decent person there was in the roof top restaurant - he was a really nice chapDont go there - spend your money elsewhere!! 
ajay guest house ,"Great value place for backpackers A great place to stay for backpackers and those travelling on a budget- probably one of the more decent choices in the area as the adjacent hotels we had seen were disgusting. We paid 700 INR a night for a double room which was clean with a/c, hot water, and even a plasma screen tv! Great value for money. The hotel had a relaxed communal area with pool tables, a German bakery and cheap internet/ wifi service. The only thing I didn't like was the food service in which I found the staff quite slack and the orders took ages to arrive.The location is fine if you want to be part of the hustle and bustle (the hotel is surrounded by local bazaars), but if not it can be quite chaotic. Generally, Ajay Guest House offers good budget accomodation and I would definately return there again. "
ajay guest house ,basic accomodation - Good area We have stayed at Ajay's 2 times and would stay there again.It is basic accomodation in the busy Paharganj area.The rooms can be a bit gloomy and typical indian bedding ( thin mattreses) but you get what you pay for.The bathrooms do have a western toilet and hot and cold water which is another bonus.They also have cheap internet on site and a travel desk to book tours and change money. The restaurant down stairs is alway busy and has nice toasted sandwiches and cakes they call it the german bakery.If you want to stay in the paharganj area then this is in the middle of the hustle and bustle and is ok for the price ( the prices have gone up since i stayed there last). 
ajay guest house ,"Terrible Terrible Terrible We had made a reservation via e-mail based on recommendations in a guide book. Our reservation and price were confirmed as were our travel arrangements. However, when we arrived after an overnight train, we were told the only room available was double the price we agreed. The staff were rude, aggressive, totally unwilling to explain to us why the reservation had not been held. They accused us of not having made a reservation and then when we could prove we had, they then told us we were too late arriving, 90 mins after our train was due to arrive at a station 40 mins away, even though they had our train details. The room we were offered did appear clean, however, it was the appalling manner in which we were treated which left a lasting impression. If you are staying here, confirm, re confirm, print your e-mails from them and have a back up plan. "
ajay guest house ,"Everything a backpacker guest house should be and more! I have regularly stayed at the Ajay hotel over the past 10 years, mostly in the budget rooms (basic: room, bed, bathroom - that's it). This most recent visit, I stayed in one of their refurbished rooms on the third floor and I was most impressed. 600 INR per night for a good sized, immaculate AC double room (with sheets and blankets), with wide screen TV, cable and en suite bathroom.As well as an excellent location, what i like about the Ajay is that it provides everything the India backpacker could want - lots of communual meeting/hang out areas (roof top cafe, seating areas on each floor, a bakery/cafe, pool table and internet cafe - and all at a budget price for those trying to stretch their pennies as far as they will go.On the downside, few of the rooms have a window, which can be disorientating if your body clock demands daylight to know what time of day or night it is, and the large open design of the building means that noise travels rather too well within the building. Use ear plugs. On the plus side, tucked up a little side street off the main Parharganj market road, it misses much of the street noise. Overall, the Ajay is an excellent and dependable budget hotel by Indian standards and I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful (actually, about 10 years ago, I got a bit of a bollocking from the manager for not locking my room properly one time, but that is a different story - it did show me that he took security seriously) and is a safe and secure place in the &quot;downtown&quot; part of New Delhi. "
ajay guest house ,Terrible place!!! I found address in internet and contact with them. They replied so I deside to stay there. Thanks for God I pay only for one night! That place is horrible! And absolutely agree with other comments! 
ajay guest house ,"Horrible place to stay This was my first visit to Delhi, and I have to say i was really horrified by this guesthouse. I'd already been travelling for 4 months and i dont think my standards are particularly high. It put the grubbiest of my student flats to shame! I arrived at about 3am, so was tired after a long flight and was picked up(arrnaged through guesthouse) in a small van which didnt start, we had to get pushed several times by strangers in the street! The room i got was tiny, like a prison cell. The white walls were covered in dirty grimy marks and dead insect stains.The bed was old and though i think the sheets were relatively clean, the place had a grimy dirty feel to it. The bathroom was disgusting, old, falling apart and felt dirty. I also had the nasty experience of someone waking me up at about 3am the next night knocking on my door. I said hello a few times but no one answered me and i could hear feet shuffling outside.I didnt open the door as im a lone female traveller but it made me very scarred. Thankfully i had bolted the door. Needless to say i left after one night. "
ajay guest house ,"Grubby and unfriendly My husband and I have just spent 2 nights at Ajays. It's not at all like the guide books say. The bathroom was filthy, the sheets were stained, there were men lurking on each floor. The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. We asked for the bathroom to be cleaned as it was so filthy it obviously hadn't been cleaned in months, they didn't clean it. We won't be going back. On the plus side you do get cable TV which is a good distraction from the dirtyness! "
ajay guest house ,"Who likes sticky beds? It may be recommended by many guide books, but frankly speeking, I found the Ajay Guest House in Pahar Ganj (the Main Bazaar) really horrible. Our room was dirty, the bed was sticky - I don't know whether the bedlinnen was cleaned at all, but they should definitely changer their washing powder, if yes. Staff wasn't helpful, either, and they overcharged on the airport pick-up (450 Rs instead of 300 Rs at the prepaid booth). It might be cheap for Delhi (ca 500 Rs for a double room) but in my opinion, it's not worth even that. There are better places at the same rate around.Ajay Guest House, Delhi, India, Paharganj, 5084 Main Bazaar Tél : --- Email : --- "

aman new delhi ,"Top Notch I was a great fan of the erstwhile Lodhi Hotel on whose site hotel Aman now stands. Located in one of the best locations of the city on Lodhi Road, Aman is another name for luxury.Right from their branded luxurious Ambassidor taxis to private pools in every suite they have it all. I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for two nights on the 4th floor with my family and we were treated like royals. Every small bit was taken care of. The staff was helpful to the core. Unlike other hotels the uniform of the staff was ethnic Indian and really smart. One of the unique thing about Aman is the &quot;jharokhas&quot;, in the corridors which allowed partial light to pass in making very beautiful and unique atmosphere. Well worth a visit if one can afford. "
aman new delhi ,"Oh My Gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From the view of a 13 year old.The Aman New Delhi was the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in! I am 1 of 4 children in my family. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite on the 7th floor of the building. We had a huge balcony, a private plunge pool and three plasma screen TV’s. We got two rollaways in the room making it big enough to sleep all of us. We only stayed for one night then caught a midnight flight to Hong Kong the next day. The parents went out during the day to do some shopping while we chilled at the hotel swimming in the pool, playing squash in the air conditioned courts, playing on one of the 3 tennis courts, exercising in the gym etc. They got back at 4:00 and we chilled some more. Then we got room service for dinner (which was very special because our dad does not like room service) and packed up for the airport. We were driven there in the specially made luxury made Aman ambassadors. The Aman New Delhi was awesome!![--] "
aman new delhi ,"Stunning My spouse and I live in New Delhi, but we stayed at this Aman to celebrate our anniversary. I agree with the previous reviewer - having lived in Delhi all my life, I can say with some confidence that this is by far the best hotel in the city.The highlight is the rooms. We had the basic one-bedroom suite, and it was absolutely gorgeous, and this I say even though I slightly preferred the rooms at Amanbagh. Judging from the other Amans' pictures, I'd say this is probably one of the nicest looking rooms in their repertoire. The plunge pool area with the daybed and large balcony is especially gorgeous, what with the light streaming in through the jharokas. The service was very good and the the massage rooms were well done. The head assistant manager was amazingly helpful - he helped my wife set up the surprise, showed her all the rooms she wanted to see so she could pick the one with the best view, and many other little things.On the downside, the lobby area as well as some other areas were unimpressive, the food was ho-hum, not at all tailored to the Indian palate, and the choice of vegetarian food was sparse. The hookah they made for us was terrible, so steer clear. They claim that they have a mughal architecture, and aside from one or two design features, they don't (but who's complaining?). The pool is nice, but not nearly as good as some other Amans. Also I would suggest going after September (that's when they properly open) if you want to avail of any of the following services - hammam, steam and sauna, one of which we did but were not told aforehand of its unavailability.We were there on a Sunday, and the church nearby had a huge procession going on from like 4 in the morning. They sang very loud, and the songs were atrocious to boot, and really ruined my night... I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours. So check up on this - I don't know if it's a Sunday morning thing or if it was some occasion.Despite it's shortcomings, hopefully all temporary, the room is so amazing that I can't justify taking off a star. "
aman new delhi ,"Best Hotel in Delhi The Aman New Delhi was not fully open on April 29th when I was there. Only 3 suites and about 2 dozen rooms were open, but all were occupied. Even the local taxi drivers do not know it yet, so ask to go to the 'Lohdi Hotel' -- the site of the new Aman. If you are an Aman Lover, this place will not let you down. Ask to stay on the top floor of the aman wing. You can see Humayan's tomb in the distance from 803. All the rooms and plunge pools face inward and are very private. Service is insane.Don't miss the Tapas bar or the spa. Each spa room has its own steam and make sure to book the room for at least 3 hours between treatments. They are currently running a 550$/Night special (Plus fees and luxury tax) so it definitely worth the splurge during this soft opening period. "

amarya garden ,"Can't say enough good things about this place. After traveling throughout India for three months, I can say that this was one of my favorite places of the entire trip. I think Amaraya Garden really colored my experience of Delhi, and it's a big reason why I enjoyed the city so much.The location is great, because it's in Defense Colony which is a lovely neighborhood. The rooms are beautiful and the staff was the best we encountered the entire trip. Breakfast is included and they tell you to order anything you want. And they mean it. Most importantly, it's obvious that the owners want you to walk away having the best experience possible. That is supposed to be the motto of any hotel, but the people here actually follow through with action. Amaraya Garden is owned by two Frenchmen, but one was out of the country when we were there. The other owner, Alex, was a fantastic host. We stayed for four nights, but I would have been happy staying there indefinitely. I think the reason we loved the hotel so much was that they were able to make an incredibly refined B&amp;B that felt like a home we had been living in for months. I can't explain it better than that. If you're staying in Delhi, this should be the first place you try to stay. It's a great value and it will greatly enhance your time in Delhi. "
amarya garden ,"FABULOUS If like us you like this kind of hotels where you just feel like at home, where you are expecting for a welcoming friendly and personnalized service, here is the place you should go in Delhi. We stayed there 2 nights after a nice trip around India right before flying back to Europe, and if it had been possible to stay longer we would have signed immediately. The rooms are lovely, very well decorated and EXTREMELY clean (which is a great point in India!). The hotel is tiny and that might be one of the reason why the staff is taking a so good care of you. Baptiste, one of the manager, was absolutely lovely to us and made us feel like at home. Anything we were asking, he could do it or find it for us, he recommended us a wonderfull restaurant, give us the perfect spot to try yoga, and the dance show he proposed us was just extraordinary great. Even if it was very hot outside, the garden is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a book with a cocktail. We wish we could go back next time we visit India. If you are looking for a room in Delhi, do not even think twice and go there !! "
amarya garden ,"A real treasure - what a wonderful introduction to Delhi While my partner had travelled to India many time on business, it was my first time. The Amarya Gardens was such a wonderful way to ease myself into India - spacious room, beautifully decorated, very clean with incredible service. Staff very friendly and owner gave us great advice on how to approach Delhi and our days there (Go to Karim's restaurant - I still dream of the food there). Breakfast was fabulous, very fresh and delicious. The building itself was unique and the garden a welcome respite from our sightseeing. We loved it - would definitely go back. "
amarya garden ,"An oasis of calm. Excellent food, lovely ambience, quiet &amp; restful. Its like a home away from home. Nice location with the Defence Colony market within walking distance. Rooms are very clean and so's the bathroom. Excellent service, very friendly staff - an oasis of calm in a city like Delhi. We liked their use of hand crafted soaps and toiletries as well as the clean linen. Much better than many places in Delhi which charge you more for less. Will definitely stay there again. Only downside is that locks on the doors need to be changed. "
amarya garden ,"Charming Boutique Hotel with great ambience a beautiful garden and so centrally located! We had the most memorable stay here and would love to return again and again! We stayed in the &quot;Golden Room&quot; - it was so grand and spacious, beautifully decorated and very very clean indeed! The bathroom was spacious and very clean too. The Dining Room and the lounge had a lovely ambiance and it was so tastefully decorated, I loved the chandelier in the Dining Area. We were served lovely breakfast in the garden, and were greeted by one of the French owners, who was so charming and caring. The entire staff was very attentive and polite and always attended to our needs. I would definitely recommend this charming, beautiful boutique hotel to everybody - just experience it! "
amarya garden ,Perfect in every way!! My daughter had been on a gap year in Southern India and we decided to meet her in Delhi and spend a few days together. We chose the hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. Tthe hotel is run by a French couple who are in the textile business. This is almost a new venture for them as they were responding to the needs of others in the textile industry that come to Delhi frequently. Its not a normal hotel and I would best describe it as staying at home with concerned parents. It even looks like a family home and has the same feel. When my daughter came up from Goa they picked her up at the airport and provided her with a driver to get around during the day and fed her for three days before we showed up. The driver plus car cost about £12 - £15 per day which is very reasonable. All the staff are very attentive and the breakfasts were excellent. The hotel is in a gated enclosure of a couple of square miles and all the gates bar one close at night. That can be tricky later on when you eat outside the community. Fortunately the shops and restaurants inside are very good and varied so there is no need to venture.outside. 
amarya garden ,"Exceptionally well run staffed and comfortable botique hotel This review is authored by a 66 year old Professor from a major research university in the USA who has stayed in countless hotels, large and small, around the world. From the arrangements for a driver to initially meet me and subsequently return me to the airport, the managers and staff of the Amarya Garden hotel worked tirelessly to ensure my stay at their hotel was comfortable and that my every need was given personal attention. Alex and Matheu are excellent managers of the hotel and truly care about their guests every need. Athaliya, Pasha, Charles and the other members of the staff act as if they are also owners in that they attend to every need with a smile and a &quot;can do&quot; attitude. The rooms and beds are large, very comfortable and quiet. The garden area contains many beautiful plantings and serves as a lovely place for meals. The chefs are well trained and can prepare an exceptional meal around almost any theme: Indian, vegetarian, Continental, etc. The hotel has arrangements with an excellent taxi service staffed with drivers who know Deli well and are attentive to their customers needs. As such, I personally award this hotel the maximum number of stars for an exceptionally comfortable five day stay in a bustling capital city. "
amarya garden ,"This is the one in New Delhi This is the most lovely place. Friendly, clean, great food, comfortable rooms and beds, in a safe convenient little enclave in New Delhi. Thank you other TA members who reviewed it. We met Alex who is one of the owners and he is just great. He employs lovely staff, Delphine, Gregoire and Jaspreet (who dealt with our booking in such a prompt and sweet way) deserve a very special mention.The hotel is in a very safe area, they have a guy on guard during the night outside just in case. Its lovely and quiet with trees in the garden yet Delhi is right out the gate and turn left or right and walk a bit, lots of shops restaurants within easy reach. Its not far from the airport.We used the hotel as a base during our month away returning there in the middle and at the end, 6 nights in all. They kept luggage for us that we didnt need on the various parts of our trip. Our room was perfect each time we returned with lovely flowers, clean beds, lots of lovely soaps, (see the previous review), towels, bath robes, in fact everything you would expect from 5* but most definitly not at a 5* price.Can not miss a mention for their cooks and chefs. They offer 24 hour restaurant/room service and they really mean it. You can get any kind of food you fancy any time. Just ask, Indian, fabulous, French, delicious, Mexican literally anything. They have got chefs from some great places including the US Embassy I believe. We had some of the best food of our trip at Amarya Garden.Thank you Alex and all the staff we hope to be back again one day soon. "
amarya garden ,Excellent response to reservation query I sent an email query and received a prompt and pleasant answer. They efficiently followed up again to remind me that they were still holding the room for me. Unfortunately my trip plans changed and I can't stay at Amarya Garden. But I am impressed with their professionalism and I will certainly stay there in the future. 
amarya garden ,"Amazing Amarya!! I simply cannot praise Amarya Garden and the staff enough! We stayed 4 nights over Christmas and it was just a fantastic experience, especially as it was our first time in Delhi.The room was lovely, the breakfast room, lounge, garden were all just beautifully decorated and kept. The staff were all really nice and helpful, especially Delphine, and well, I do not think I have ever praised a place this much!It is not cheap for India, but what a treat it is and when summed up it is total value for money.I can highly resommend Amarya Garden "
amarya garden ,"Absolutely brilliant the best antidote to a busy day in Delhi We booked directly with the hotel and stayed there in December on either side of a friend's wedding in Gujurat. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone, it is lovely. We were bowled over by how belpful everyone was, and even though the hotel only has 4 rooms it has everything you could need. We ate in the hotel several times and were very pleased with the food, the chef is around most of the time and you can pretty much decide what you would like and when, instead of having a fixed menu.It's not far into the centre of town - about 20 minutes by moto-rickshaw. I have to say that Delhi is quite hard work, in my opinion, but I would say that having somewhere as restful as this to go back to at the end of the day was well worth the money.We stayed in the Gold Room, which was really lovely. The room was enormous and had a comfortable bed (!!!), occasional furniture and nice bathroom. Really nice decor, it's like being in a quirky friend's house.Just an indication of the thoughtfulness of the staff, it was my husband's birthday on one of the days we stayed and they gave him a lovely bouquet of flowers! In short, if I was going back to Delhi I wouldn't think twice about staying here again. In fact, I wish they would open some in other places too! "
amarya garden ,"an oasis in Dehi; a wonderful find If you are not particularly into generic five star hotels, then stay at Amarya Garden or Haveli during your time in Delhi. I have been to Delhi many times and stayed at a variety of hotels. Amarya Garden was by far the best - the location is great (Defence Colony in South Delhi), the rooms are beautifully decorated in a funky and individual way and the service is excellent. Both the Garden and Haveli (in Hauz Khas) are more guest houses than hotels but that is part of the charm for me. Neither have many rooms but both operate a 24 hour kitchen, do laundry and can arrange transport services. They both have wifi internet and one night we decided to stay in and they prepared us a lovely dinner. Breakfast is also served as the norm and in the Garden you can eat it in the garden. If your budget stretches to it I would chose the Garden but we also stayed in the Haveli and it was lovely. I will definitely stay again and recommend it to all my friends. "
amarya garden ,"Funky and wonderful! What a delightful place the Amarya Garden is! I have not experienced a nicer place to stay in any of India's metropolitan centres. Staying at the Amarya Garden is like staying at the house of a friend with good taste, but with all of the comfort and service of a good hotel. With just four rooms, the place is cozy, and guests get full run of the funky sitting and dining rooms. The service is wonderful, and there is 24-hour room service, including reasonably priced wine and beer. Delphine, the manager, and all of the staff were incredibly kind and friendly throughout our short stay.Our room, the Green Room, was very nicely appointed - scented candles, comfy pillows, a little balcony shaded by a large tree, and a modern bathroom with a rainhead shower. The breakfasts were wonderful, including French-style crepes and perhaps the best cup of coffee we had in our 2 months in Delhi.There are lots of other small touches - free wireless internet; they can arrange a car and driver, and charge it directly to your room bill so you don't have to worry about negotiating with the driver; they even do mobile phone hire at a decent rate. The location is great - just 5 minutes' walk to Defence Colony market, with its plethora of good restaurants, bars, and shops. There is no question that I will stay here again on my next visit to Delhi! "
amarya garden ,"Amazing If you do only one thing in Delhi, then stay at Amarya Garden! this place is amazing and probably the best place i have stayed. Its a little boutique place - only 4 bedrooms (so book ahead!). We had the gold room which was just stunning and the service is exceptional. Breakfast is amazing as is dinner and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area and v quiet (which is heaven after been in India for 2 months). It was my last stay in India after 2 months and I'm glad I stayed there - just wish it could have been longer! "
amarya garden ,"Tranquillity amongst chaos What can I say about this place...........pretty special and one that goes down as a must when recommending to others. The room, the people, the service, simply impeccable. My partner and I stayed here after three weeks touring around India and this really did represent the best way to sign off a great three weeks. Unlike the big five star hotels which provide exorbitant fees but not much else, Amarya Garden's represent value of money if there is such a thing.A big thank you to the hotel manager Aparna Sethi and her attentive staff who couldn't have done anymore to make us both feel welcome. The homely atmosphere was even more welcome when my partner developed a bout of Delhi Belly and Gandhi's revenge at the same time. Their caring attitude was a real plus for which Anna will be always grateful. I could go on, but I think you get the message. You can stay at a lot cheaper places and a lot more. This is the best of both worlds. I just hope anyone staying on my recommendation likes the place as much as ourselves. Enjoy. "
amarya garden ,"Haven If you've heard about Amarya Garden (or it's sister Amarya Haveli which is apparently wonderful) then you'll probably already know how exceptional it is. It's away from the main tourist areas but you'd be lucky to find a hideaway like this anywhere in the centre. My room was a cocoon in the mayhem of Delhi, combining European taste with Indian history. The staff made me feel incredibly welcome - like a guest in their home. In fact it is more like a home than a hotel. It is in a residential area but that means you can come and go hassle-free and take an autorickshaw or taxi wherever you need to go. Worth every penny (and it cost quite a few!) but still cheaper than some of the ropey hotels on offer in Delhi. "

ambassador hotel ,"Delightful period hotel with scope for improvement If, as seems inevitable, you're landed with paying extortionate prices for Delhi hotel rooms, you may as well go for the period charms of the Ambassador. Lovely ambience and location. Solicitous staff. Bedrooms furnished in a tastefully understated manner. Here are some suggestions for improvements: 1. Beds are a bit military in their springing. Something a little bit more luxurious would be appreciated. And pillows with a natural filling really should be the default in a hotel of this standard.2. When every bedroom overlooking the centre court enjoys the luxury of a balcony, why not make more of it? Put a couple of chairs out on them, perhaps?3. The public areas are not used as well as they could be. The 'Yellow Brick Road' really doesn't make the grade as a coffee shop in a hotel of this status. With its hard chairs, lighting and surfaces, it enjoys all the ambience of a works canteen. Escape from its noise into the softer surroundings of the bar and you're assailed by a Philippino karaoke duo. Please, a little bit of quiet. And the only smart restaurant in the hotel is Chinese. Am I missing something here? Why do I want to eat Chinese food in India? "
ambassador hotel ,"The worst ever Poor hotel which needs an urgent renovation. Baware that &quot;balcony&quot; does not mean &quot;nice view&quot;. My room was in front of the Air Con system of the hotel, ugly view but also extremly noisy nights and days.But the WORST.....If you like to be bothered during your night by MOUSES running into the air conditionning system of your room then you'll be delighted (I mention MOUSES because I've SEEN them into the grill of my Air Con in my room...).. Insane! "
ambassador hotel ,"Good location spacious rooms The Ambassador is a charming hotel with a soul. Excellent service from check in to check out, clean and spacious rooms and bathroom. Khan market is in walking distance. Draw back: Small breakfast room and limited selection of food for breakfast. High cost for internet access: 662 IR for 24 hrs. The Ambassador would be my first choice for New Delhi except for the small breakfast room and the very limited selection of breakfst choices. "
ambassador hotel ,"Taj Ambassador - Damaging the Taj brand This hotel is not worthy of sporting the Taj brand - had this been the first Taj that I had been too, it would have also have been the last. I associate the Taj brand as one of quality but the Ambassador is simply not worthy.The experience begins as you drive up to the hotel, the poor quality barriers to stop traffic alert you to the cheap and nasty nightmare that lies within. As you approach the building, with paint fading, peeling and the landscaping needing serious attention then it starts to feel like a substandard hotel.The lobby is small but acceptable but the reception desk is small and old-fashioned. The service is acceptable but nothing more. The cost of a room is far too high for what is being offered.The walk to my room showed the hotel decor to be tired and dated, it smelled musty and was crying out to be refurbished. My room was terrible - nasty furniture, uncomfortable bed and awful bathroom. I would rather have stayed in a $30 room in Delhi - at least I would have got what I paid for.The quality of the food at the restaurants was not up to the quality of the Mumbai Taj hotels and I could not get myself to stay longer than one night. I checked out and moved to a nearby decent hotel.Taj - drop the brand or spend some money. This hotel is doing you a disservice.The d "
ambassador hotel ,"Close to perfect stay- and will be coming back Was here for a week of business at the beginning of July and as I am here in Delhi again for another week I booked again at the Ambassador as I had such a pleasant stay my first go around. I will be coming back to Delhi several times over the coming months and I fully intend to stay here.The room themselves are excellent- clean and spacious with great work space (important since I spend a great deal of time working at my computer from my hotel room). Service in the hotel is great as they have a very polite, efficient and helpful staff. They can almost be too helpful at times and I've taken to leaving the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; light on to avoid the seemingly incessent knocks at my door asking if I need anything.The food is also excellent in all 3 restaurants as well as from room service. Only criticism I really have is for the lounge- InSomnia. It could be a great place to relax, if the music weren't so bad- apparently he feels that at the end of a business day a lone business traveller wants to listen to heart-jarring disco beats...Overall great hotel- terrible DJ. "
ambassador hotel ,"Lovely stay I stayed at Ambassador quite a few times in the past, but this time it wasnt really the same. No dont get me wrong, it was largely because of the metro construction close by that the approach to the hotel became quite a pain. Anyways, i did spent three days in the hotel and the place - once you get inside - has its own quiet charm. The rooms are pretty spacious and I did like the fact that they still have the old kind of balconies in the room where you can go out and stand. The restaurant - Yellow brick stone is quite a hit both for the in-guests and outsiders. It surely has a nice warm feel to it and the menu card in the form of a newspaper was very pretty. The pub is mostly deserted and i didnt find much crowd there and you do feel a bit silly sitting all by yourself in a pub - although the interior and the decor is done quite well. But there is a bit of an old legacy feel to the hotel - in the way its constructed, in the way you see the interiors and also the way you get treated. Room service was pretty good as is the case with most Taj hotels. Overall a pretty good stay at the hotel and i do hope that the metro construction finishes soon so that the approach to the hotel becomes as smooth as it used to be in the past. "
ambassador hotel ,Good spacious rooms Huge rooms and bathrooms. Taj service as usual impeccable. Dont expect great views from your balcony. Nearby metro construction can be noisy sometimes. Has a great Non Veg Thali in room service menu 
ambassador hotel ,"Business pleasure I found the Ambassador Hotel very convenient. It is certainly well-located, next to the airport. The rooms are clean and comfortable. No complanits about the service. "
ambassador hotel ,"perfect location for a short business trip While on a short trip for a conference nearby, I found the Ambassador Hotel very convenient. It is certainly well-located, next to the airport. The rooms are clean and comfortable. No complanits about the service.It may not be the best hotel for the money you pay but it is certainly convenient for a business trip as you avoid travelling on the busy Delhi roads. "
ambassador hotel ,"I loved the location and the service quality. It was way back in Feb 2008, when me and my family members decided to visit New Delhi.We were advised by our relatives that the Ambassador, (A part of the Taj Group), is the best hotel available for us, reason being Khan market just next to it.We really had a good time, though or stay was short, but the location and the service quality of the hotel is excellent. The staff is so polite and co operative, which is something I really liked. "
ambassador hotel ,"great hotel in good lcoation Very good hotel, rooms are large and the staff are friendly and efficient. Good choice at breakfast, insomnia bar is a good choice for drinks and dinner in the Chinese restaurant was good. Taxis are available on demand at the door and the hotel is in a good location. Khan market is a few minutes walk with a good selection of shops for essentials or gifts and some restaurants. "
ambassador hotel ,great rooms Rooms are large as well as the bathrooms. Very comfortable. Loved the large tv screen. 
ambassador hotel ,"Business with pleasure As a formal guest of the United Nations(UNAIDS),going back to Delhi(the city of my alma mater,AIIMS) was indeed very exciting-both in anticipation and also in real terms..The visit was very different from the other official visits to Delhi for formal meetings at NACO,Govt of India where I have queue up to get a pre- paid cab and go through the rituals of shouting my name and destination to the traffic cop supposedly working for the convenience and safety of the passengers.It was real treat to be welcomed by a turbaned and liveried chauffeur with an attendant carrying an exclusive placard with my name calligraph ed as in my MBBS and MD degrees.The big limousine (or at leas t it looked like one to me -used to travelling in black and yellow ambassador taxis with noisy body parts and noisier drivers) or whatever that 'AMBASSADOR vehicle' was, had air conditioned at the right temperature and humidity levels.Before taking my permission to stay back at the airport treated me royally by offering a glass of cold water in a tray which also had the newspaper and two magazines to be read in a drive which any case could not last longer than 25 minutes .Quite expectedly the services in the hotel definitely matched with the 'mobile' outreach services extended to me in the car itself.Indeed an experience I cherish to this day.

ambassador hotel ,good location location is close to the airport. lobby is good but the services are not great. 
ambassador hotel ,Great Place Excellent place to stay. i would defintely like to be there again 
ambassador hotel ,Bit surprised by the reviews we didnt find this value It is a while since we stayed here but well over 300usd a night is not value for this level of hotel. Delhi clearly has a lack of supply when it comes to hotel rooms as everything was booked solid. This was the most expensive accomodation of our trip and yet the most average accomodation - compared to the TAJ in Mumbai and Goa very basic. The room was large but very basic (felt a bit like an old boarding room with a nice tv). Front desk service was ordinary but the concierge woman was fantastic. Location is quite good being a short walk from Khan mkt and Lodhi gardens. We used a car service one day from the hotel and it was fine. The pool is a tiny above ground pool (the type u used to see in aussie backyards in the 70's and 80's). Brekkie in the little coffee shop was pleasant. Would stay here again if the price was considerably lower. 
ambassador hotel ,"Delhi's best value 5-star service The decor may not be quite as ritzy as its sister Taj hotels, but this is a great hotel for the price. Amazing service, delicious room service and top-notch linens, toiletries etc. I cannot say enough about the hospitable and helpful staff. When this hotel is discounted on websites, it is well worth the extra $30-$50 over other mid-range hotels. Outstanding location too - walking distance to Western-catering Khan market. "
ambassador hotel ,"Very Nice Hotel Great Staff, Nice Decor, Big Rooms, Very Comfortable Beds, Good Food. Downsides were a hotel pick up from the Airport that was 45 minutes late, very small lifts and the price of the hotel is a bit too much for what the hotel provides. "
ambassador hotel ,"If you have to stay in a Delhi hotel ........ Delhi is under-hoteled and therefore over priced. Ambassador is not the best hotel in town: it may be the best value for money. Some may say that it cries for a refurb. There are past their time tenanted shops on the ground floor outside. The retail concessions inside are modest. The nearby Khan Market is one of Delhi's best shopping areas, and blessed with interesting small, international-menu restaurants. For India it is relatively quiet, just out of town, mercifully free of beggars and con-men at the door. We appreciated the large rooms, fairly well appointed, even if they were done some time ago.During the extension of the Delhi Metro the pool was out of bounds. Management kindly provided free transport to the better pool and gym of the nearby Taj Hotel. "
ambassador hotel ,"Ambassador was pretty good The Ambassador hotel is a clean, western style hotel that made a good base for us for our first few days in India. The rest of the trip we stayed in much less posh hotels, but this was a comforting place to first land. It looks like your average American 3 star hotel. What made it great for us was that the staff was extremely helpful, the driver they provided was really great, and they went out of our way to help us navigate Delhi and arrange the rest of our trip. I'd recommend this to people looking to ease into India. "
ambassador hotel ,"Highly Recommend this Hotel I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel for 2 nights. The room was large, comfortable, and nicely appointed. This is an older hotel with a nice ambiance.The construction for the Delhi Metro was right outside my window. When I saw it, I immediately asked to be moved to a different room. I was told it would be impossible that night, but they could move me the next day. However, I was not overly bothered by the noise and decided to stay in the original room for my second night.The restaurant provided an adequate, tasty breakfast buffet.There are three roof top patios’ (all on the same floor). They are hard to find but nice to sit on.The hotel staff are very friendly and efficient.I would definitely stay at this hotel again. "
ambassador hotel ,"Very conveniently located I spent a most enjoyable 2 1/2 days at the Ambassador just before Christmas. The location was perfect for the places I wanted to visit, and when the metro subway station that is being constructed next door is completed in a couple of years, this will become one of the most conveniently located hotels in the city.As at other hotels in the city, in response to the recent terrorist attack in Mumbai, security measures were taken quite seriously. All vehicles were searched before being allowed to enter the grounds, and visitors and guests were required to pass through metal detectors, in addition to being physically searched and having any packages scanned for suspicious contents. In fact, there was a veritable army of security personnel on hand at the gates and the entrance (I saw more staff there than anywhere else in the entire hotel).As noted in other reviews, this is not one of the premier Taj properties. If you are looking for glitz and glitter, or are booking a room for your honeymoon, you'll do far better to look at the sister Taj down the road. But if you are just looking for a safe, clean, and comfortable place to lie down at night, you should consider the Ambassador if you can get it at a reasonable price.I had searched for a room on kayak.com, which led me to a discount hotel room broker where I was able to book a room for Rs. 6580 per night before taxes (about US$ 136). (Note that, as at other hotels, the taxes substantially increase the total cost.) Right before booking through the internet, I had called the hotel to inquire as to the lowest rate available and was quoted approximately Rs. 11000 -- so check for internet discounts before you book!Wireless internet access cost an additional fee -- about Rs. 750 per 24 hours. I had no problems at all getting a strong signal from my room. (But internet access in a business hotel in this day and age really should be included in the price of the room.)At check in, I requested a quiet room to avoid any noise from the metro station construction, and I was given a room in one of the triangular hotel's wings that faces away from the construction site. The room had a balcony that let in a lot of light, but overlooked a rather unattractive inner court. I wasn't disturbed by any noise from the metro construction site during my stay, but then I really didn't hear much noise coming from the site as I walked right by it several times over the course of my stay. On the other hand, I could clearly hear the voices of people in the hallway from my room. And there were occasional, tolerable noises from renovations that were apparently underwear elsewhere in the hotel.The room was immaculate and very comfortable, although the mattress was quite firm. There were faint traces of unpleasant odors in the hall outside my room (I think from painting or other renovation work) and from the airconditioner in the room (mouldy smell), but the temperature was such that it wasn't really necessary to turn on the aircon since there was also a fan in the room.All of the staff with whom I interacted, from check in, to housekeeping, to laundry staff, were gracious and friendly. (And, I might add, astonishingly attractive.)The fitness center was pretty rudimentary -- a couple of treadmills, a couple of other cardio machines, and some free weights. The pool is under renovation, but a car was offered to transport guests to the sister property down the road if a dip in the pool was desired.I very much appreciated that when I asked the staff the typical cost for a taxi to the airport, I was told that a hotel car was available (I think the fee was Rs. 1050 plus tax), but that an alternative was a black-and-yellow taxi for Rs. 350, which is what I took, after having to wait only a couple of minutes for the taxi to drive over. (Certain other hotels would not have mentioned that the lower-cost option was available.)My only complaint apparently arose from a misunderstanding at checkout. I had planned to pay for a 3-night stay, intending to check out on the third evening to catch an 11:00pm flight. As I was checking out, the clerk noted that the terms for the discounted rate of my room prohibited any modifications to the scheduled stay. He said that since I was checking out &quot;early&quot; (8 pm on the third night rather than before noon the following morning), I would be charged a full-night as a cancellation penalty. We got into an argument over whether or not this was a cancellation. In retrospect, I think he must have mistakenly thought I was trying to get the hotel to allow me to just pay for 2 nights and be allowed to check out very late on the third day (either that or he was just clueless).Overall, I would recommend a stay here if you can get a room under US $160 per night (maybe even $200 if it's high season and the supply of rooms in hotels of this caliber around the city are tight). I can't see paying anything like $300, such as mentioned in other reviews. "
ambassador hotel ,"Odd Mixture of classic and modern Like India itself, the Ambassador is hard to describe in a few sentences. It is a grand old property, with large &quot;staterooms.&quot; Mine had a huge balcony as well as a fireplace -- neither serving any purpose beyond decoration, but evoking some bygone era. The location is convfenient. The clientele is diverse and appears travel-wise. The restoration of the hotel is schitzophrenic. The hallways and rooms have some pictures and features invoking the Raj. To get to my 4th floor room, you had to walk outside on a funky roof terrace to get to the other wing. But these are offset by bad imitiations of charmless 1970's Holiday Inn room design, e.g. shower/bath and boxy, uncomfortable chairs. The breakfast restaurant is equally odd, a cramped space, painted yellow, far from the lobby, that could have been some roadside dive in the U.S., but incongruously decorated with colonial era posters and knicknacks.The staff is unfailingly cheerful and helpful on the whole, but i had some issues at checkout as they attempted to charge for airport shuttle service, which had been promoted as a free benefit. (They did erase the charge.) Internet wifi was unreliable. From what I've seen, there aren't many Delhi hotels that are neither pretentious nor seedy. The Ambassador fills that niche. "
ambassador hotel ,"Functional Hotel nice and quiet Its an old colonial property perfectly converted into a great hotel. The service was excellent and just loved the restaurant, which reminded me of a typical American breakfast restaurant. The food was simply excellent and when we booked, they were offering a huge discount so got it at a very good price. It is very close to a central business area of New Delhi. I will suggest it for business travelers as well as for tourists. :-) "
ambassador hotel ,Beware Construction Site night time work!!!!! We arrived at The Ambassador on October 5th and checked in at around 10:30pm from the airport and were &quot;upgraded&quot; to a room which overlooked the construction site!!! working thru the entire night!!! Even with earplugs I could hear it!! Trying not to be rude or impolite I tried to deal with it but at 5am I had to go downstairs to complain... the front desk person said that the hotel was completely booked... they had a sign up apologizing for the noise ... if I had come down sooner she would have switched the room (it was fully booked? she just said) offered to let me sleep for a few hours in a room that someone just checked out of!!! I had to wait until Mr Vishal Sekhri arrived to resolve it. We were checking out at 9 am!!! he offered me 25% rate reduction and a snack for the road trip to Agra. Total charge for the room 210.00 USD after the discount. He also said that had I notified them earlier that he could possibly have worked something out with the other Taj Hotel in Delhi and moved us to the other hotel. We paid for our own breakfasts. He promised that he would contact the Taj View Agra to make sure that we had a nice stay... We arrived in Agra and the hotel is no longer the Taj View ... it's called The Gateway and is no longer part of the chain. I'm warning people not to stay there if they are offered a room on the construction side of the hotel... It was TOTALLY NOT FAIR ... not give us an option or tell us personally when we checked in. WHY!!!! would anyone &quot;UPGRADE&quot; a guest to a room which is affected by the construction noise that goes on all night!!!?? they should have told us personally when we checked in and NOT assumed that we read the sign about the construction noise... we didn't . It is so disrespectful and unfair to try to make people pay for that kind of room with out giving them an option. My niece stayed in an interior room and didn't hear the heavy machinery..her stay was fine. aesthetically nice hotel... I'm sure it would have been great if we weren't affected by the construction noise... please ask not to be placed in a room on that side or beware... for now. 
ambassador hotel ,"Pretty bulk standard hotel Not a bad hotel - we had just finished a 19 hour train trip and were pretty exhausted, so the comfy bed was much appreciated - but it's quite old looking and very expensive for what it is. The Sheraton was full, which was how we ended here, but that is a much nicer (and cheaper) place. It's comfy but at £150 a night you don't really get your monies worth. We were only there for a few hours though, so did not get to sample anything much except the bed.Also, beware, the front desk will try to charge you in sterling, thereby giving you their exchange rate, which, like all hotels rates, is lower than you will get from you credit card company. "
ambassador hotel ,"Very good luxury value for money Being a Taj hotel, I expected high quality amenities and service and that's definitely what we got. We stayed at the hotel for 14 days (4+5+5) during our holiday in India in their superior room, which is a bit bigger than the standard. The room was spacious with comfortable furniture and very attentive staff who ensured that the room was cleaned and tidied, twice a day, the bathroom was cleaned and checked twice a day and minibar was always well stocked. Fruit and small floral decorations were always fresh.The 24 hr restaurant is a bit small, but the breakfast is very good and the service is very good. I used the 24 hr business centre a few times, everything worked just as I wanted.We found Larry's (odd name for a Chinese restaurant) to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in Delhi - and we've tried a fair number of them. The hotel is next to Khan market, so going for a stroll to shops and restaurants is a breeze.The hotel is very central, just 1 km from India Gate, so getting to places all over Delhi is easy. I spent hours in the horrenduous Delhi traffic, so I really appreciated the 15-30 mins I saved daily (compared to the luxury hotels nearer the airport).Since the swimming pool was closed due to some construction work, we were offered a free car to drive us to the other Taj hotel just 2 minutes away and use all the facilities there just by showing them our room card. We charged our poolside expenses and retaurant bills to our room and when we were done, we just asked for a complementary car tht drove us back to the Ambassador free of charge. A bit more cumbersome than taking a lift down to the pool, but we can't grumble.Considering the price, we were genuinely surprised that this rennovated 1930's hotel was so luxurious.Will I stay there again? You bet. "
ambassador hotel ,"No Fuss Hotel Taj Ambassador is situated near the Mansingh road and is easily one of the best localities in New Delhi. This hotel is not so grand but is a no fuss hotel. A top notch taj service is what you can express. Rooms are about 350 sqft. It has all the modern amenitites of a 5 star hotel. THe hotel is small and a cozy one. Ambassadors breakfast is a little small considering its Taj. But one can expect a great deal of ala -carte menu. If you dont look for grand lobbies at the hotel than this one is the best deal for you as you will be almost experiencing the 5star quality and service from the Ambassador. But ya dont forget to visit the Taj Mahal jus 700 mts away from the ambassador, its worth a watch. "
ambassador hotel ,"The Taj - Unplugged The Hotel Taj Ambassador is one of the most affordable hotels of the Taj group. A forty minute drive from the airport and your greeted by a white dressed doorman, not in his Taj uniform but with a Taj smile. The lobby is just about ok. Nothing special; no Belgium Chandeliers or Italian fabric sofas. No forty feet ceiling either. Decent though its what you would expect from a 3 star property in Delhi. The check in was really quick. In less than five minutes I was unpacking. The room was decent enough. It had a good sized bed, a sofa and table, mini office chair and desk, a large mirror, a wardrobe with locker, forty inch Samsung LCD TV and a mini bar. The daikin air con was really powerful to take the Delhi heat. The bathroom was really big. It had a huge mirror and bathtub. Sadly the only area where you can bath is in the tub. Careful as it can be slippery. The hotel has two restaurants and one bar. The first one is called the Yellow Brick Road. A small multi cuisine cum 24/7 coffee shop. Cant call this one as cozy or star decor. It serves the morning breakfast as well. The breakfast was nothing great, limited dishes and no live kitchen. They serve Polk. Something I didn't like. Usually Polk and beef are not served in breakfast in most hotels that I have been to, keeping in mind religious sentiments of the two communities. I could not try it for lunch or dinner as it was always packed. The second restaurant is called The Larry's China. With a limited menu choice the dishing are both spicy and pricey. A gravy dish is for anything between 475 to 1100 Inr. Many of my favorite dishes like Chinese fried chicken and fried ice cream were missing. The chef promised me these on my next visit. You may want to try the lemon chicken. The bar was out of bounds for me as I don't drink. They have a gym and a spa ( affiliated to mystic ) on the fifth floor. It has two techno gym treadmills and two cross trainers along with a couple of free weights. No strength machines. The spa is with limited massage treatments. The young staff ( many trainee's I assume ) are always on their toes. Anything you want its a smile Yes Sir and its done. They never seem to refuse to anything. I do believe the property has a swimming pool but I could visit it during my two day stay. The hotel exterior looked dated. It really needs a paint job. Moreover its sandwitched between two sets of apartments giving it a rather two star look. Lot of lazy taxi drivers sleeping around. All in all a good two day stay which was well worth the money. I booked through their web site as it makes it thirty percent cheaper than booking over their front office. The Taj experience is always unique. Whether its their five star property or a three star one. They really know how to take care of a guest. I have been to many hotels across the length and breath of my great country. This group really knows a guests needs and makes sure every stay is memorable. A group which believes in acquiring historical palaces and converting them into hotels rather than building modern structures. At checkout you would want to come back soon. A feeling very few hotels can offer you. However its Taj unplugged. If you want the full Taj experience try the one right behind this hotel. The big apple &quot;The Taj Mahal.&quot; I had the time to visit it. Its simply out of the world and can be compared to none other than The Imperial Delhi. On my next visit in july it would be between these two hotels.Best wishes "
ambassador hotel ,"Not the best Taj hotel but a good stay for the price This is the lowest rent Taj hotel I've ever been to, but it was still clean and comfortable. I had the feeling that this was the hotel where the Taj organization trains a lot of their staff. We ran into at least 3 &quot;trainees&quot; while we were there 2 nights. The staff seemed rather confused in general, but luckily I didn't need to call on them for any emergencies/The building has a colonial feel. One quirk is that we had to walk through an uncovered outdoor patio on our floor to get from the elevator to our room. Next the Khan market and easily accessible everywhere by cab or tuktuk.The restaurants in the hotel were kinda lame. For a real treat, take a cab a few minutes up the street to the super posh Taj hotel and take your pick of fantastic restaurants. "
ambassador hotel ,"Good location but an 'international' hotel This hotel is a very good standby for New Delhi. By far its best attraction is its location. It is in New Delhi so good wide streets, next door to Khan Market (not a market but a small area of good standard shops) and close to Lodi Gardens if you wanted a stroll. Also close to some good restaurants if you don't want to eat in the hotel.We stayed in heritage hotels for the rest of our stay so this hotel was never going to stand up by comparison. It is more of a business hotel. The rooms had no character but were big and clean. The breakfast was very average, service good but the food is not of the high quality we experienced the rest of our time in India. In conclusion, there was nothing wrong with the hotel but it just won't be one of the highlights of your trip. If you do stay, the Chick Inn about a 10/15 minute walk is well worth the effort. It was recommended to us by our guide. Apart from us, the rest of the people in there were Indians which was good testimony. The walk to the place is mostly on main roads and we felt very safe. Try the garlic bread. "
ambassador hotel ,"Quirky Hotel I received a lovely welcome after arriving exhausted into Delhi. This level of warmth, professionalism was shown by all staff thoughout my stay. The internal restaurants were great too - very quirky - bordering in kitsch but very humourous too. The location was great, rooms good size and it was great to go for a walk in the nearby park in the mornings before the heat of the day. A little dated but that adds to the charm! "
ambassador hotel ,"A First Rate Hotel We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel, New Delhi, from the 23rd – 24th July 2007. Our party consisted of two adults and two young children. We were en route from Calcutta to Trivandrum using Rajdhani Express rail services.Our suite at the Ambassador was absolutely huge, clean and well maintained. We found staff at this property to be efficient and eager to please. Once settled in we went to their small swimming pool, accessed by walking through the ‘Yellow Brick Road’ coffee shop on the ground floor. We were there for around a couple of hours and the kids had a bite to eat whilst the adults read the newspapers and magazines poolside.I was feeling a bit under the weather, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the hotel. I ended up going to bed for the rest of the day. Staff offered to get a Doctor, which I declined. They came round with a number of bottles of mineral water at no extra cost, which I thought was a nice gesture. I had no dinner, however the other family members did eat downstairs. They thought the food was fine. In their absence I was able to connect to the hotel’s Wi Fi network.Breakfast at the Yellow Brick Road café was actually very good. Chicken sausages, beans, hash browns, cold meat, fruit, cereals, local food, croissants, eggs (fried, scrambled, boiled or omelettes) etc. Even though it was a buffet, staff were very helpful and brought tea, coffee and hot chocolate (for the children). They also organised the omelettes and fried eggs. No matter was too much for them. The Taj Group clearly train their staff well. "
ambassador hotel ,"Good choice next to Khan Market Stayed 7 nights in June and enjoyed the stay very much. The room (205) was huge with slightly old interior but very clean and the bathroom was excellent with quality toiletries (loved the lemon soap!). Not necessarily a 5-star establishment, but the price was right and the proximity to Khan Market was a great bonus in the summer heat. "
ambassador hotel ,"Very good hotel (by Indian standards though) This would probably be an overpriced, just average hotel somewhere else, but in Delhi this is actually a good choice if you get the discount rate booking through the Internet.Service at the hotel is good, with plenty of attentive staff everywhere. Rooms are not modern but they are large and comfortable. Some of them are being slowly renovated (I had a 42'' LCD TV in my room while some coleagues got an old 21''). Toiletteries and fresh fruits in your room are renovated dayly. Food at the hotel is ok, but the hotel being just a block away from the Khan Market allows you to avoid the ridiculous prices of the restaurants and eat at an expensive (again, by Indian standards) but safe and tasty place (like &quot;The Big Chill&quot; -- great food and desserts) at half the price.The low points: - Pool: Small, sometimes bad smelling, plus you have to go through a restaurant to get there.- Wi-Fi: I think it's ok to charge this service, but US$ 7 per hour seems a bit too much. Same with calls, just use the payphone at the shop next to the hotel. "
ambassador hotel ,"Comfortable but problems at the front desk The facilities and rooms at the Ambassador are good. Nothing over-the-top luxurious but definitely comfortable. My room was a suite. It was usually well cleaned except for one day in my week-long stay they did not replace the flower in the bud vase or the towels. I of course didn't care about the flower but had to call for towels to take a shower. Overall, though, the room was clean, quiet, and spacious. The hotel felt safe.The room had a lot of extra amenities: minibar, bandaids, robe, slippers, shoe wax, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc...Room service was excellent, as was the breakfast provided with the room price.Wireless was available, but for a considerable cost. I think that a hotel that markets itself as a &quot;business hotel&quot; should have free wireless. I had a snafu with booking that took several trips to the front desk to be fixed. The people at the front desk were friendly but quite unhelpful with trying to resolve this issue. "
ambassador hotel ,"Enjoyed the tranquillty of the hotel Despite what others have written, I really enjoyed this hotel. I have stayed at many of the other 4-5 star hotels in India and although this hotel is a bit older than some of the other hotels, I actually liked the charm and enjoyed the convenience of the location. The staff was great. The accomodations, although not extravagent, were comfortable. The dining area was quaint and made me a feel a bit more at &quot;home&quot; than a lot of the other big chain hotel. "
ambassador hotel ,"Ambassador a deco delight! My superior room was huge, comfortable and included immaculate bedding and fresh flowers. The hotel is a small , quiet gem, with staff who truly care. An oasis from the chaos of Delhi, steps from Khan Market (good shopping). Stayed there twice on recent trip, and felt a tug when leaving. Well-stocked mini bar with reasonable prices, and also a small 'tuck shop' at the edge of the building. Excellent breakfast at the Yellow Brick Road was included in my room package.If you begin or end your India visit in Delhi, the Ambassador will add to the fascination. If it wasn't half a world away I would return just for the enjoyment of the hotel. "
ambassador hotel ,"Ripoff After staying at some of the best Taj properties all over India, this one just stinks in comparison. We went during high season, butstill, paying $300 for a dinky little room with peeling paint, moldy bathroom with broken tiles and ancient fixtures is just one huge ripoff! I can't figure out at all how this even qualifies as a Taj hotel.The restaurants there are pretty good, but for my money, I'd stay elsewhere and just come here for a meal. "
ambassador hotel ,"HUGE Rooms! -- Pleasant Stay... This was the first hotel we stayed in when we were in Delhi. The lobby is nice and the staff was fine. The rooms are absolutely enormous. We had a balcony and sitting area. We had 6 in our group, so three rooms. Some of the rooms even had a flat plasma screen TV in their rooms. The bathrooms are enormous too. THey didn't have the &quot;extra amenities&quot; like a robe or slippers, but it was very comfortable. The bed was very soft and comfortable. Breakfast was included and it was very good -- buffet style with eggs that you can be ordered separately. We had dinner there as well. It wasn't the best, but they did have a lot of variety and it wasn't that expensive (especially for a hotel). Overall, it was a nice hotel, but not over the top in service. If you want space, this is a great choice. "

ananda hotel ,"You get what you pay for… The location is convenient and provides a real experience of Old Delhi. The staff were helpful and a free transfer was arranged from the airport.The hotel is very basic. The room was clean, but damp, and had most things promised including air conditioning and a television (no hot water though).The roof top restaurant is not too pretty to look at but the food was good, great value and with friendly service - it’s open 24hrs which was a very nice 2am arrival welcome.We used Ananda Hotel as a base for exploring Delhi independently - we didn’t spend much time at the hotel and we didn’t use the expensive hotel travel agent.Bearing in mind the price and facilities, I think this hotel is good value and an acceptable budget traveller choice – at the time of booking the rate was half that of other hotels in The Connaught Place area of Delhi. "
ananda hotel ,"Nice small hotel with friendly staff Located in Karol Bagh,this hotel was in a good jumping off point. The staff assisted me with arrangements for my trips to Agra, Jaipur and Haridwar. I found the room to be clean and attractive and theprice was more than right. "
ananda hotel ,"Nice hotel near shopping area. Nice, clean hotel near the shopping streets of Karol Bagh.The staff were helpful and the hotel had a car and driver that we hired for daytrips and airport pick-up/dropp-off. Only 5 minutes walk to the busy market-streets were we did the most of our shopping. "
ananda hotel ,"This?Hotel?Cannot?Be?Trusted We reserved two rooms at Hotel Ananda a month in advance.We exchanged some emails, including their confirmation email, our flight information email, and a reconfirmation email that we sent two days prior to our arrival date.Things went smoothly UNTIL the night we arrived at Delhi airport.We finally got to Delhi, filled with excitement and anxiety from our long flight....only to find out that we no longer had our reservation for the night.(Needless to say, there was nobody from the hotel at the airport, although the hotel had guaranteed that they would send somebody for us.)The hotel's excuse was that all their rooms were sold out the night (!!!) and that we were going to be taken to another &quot;upgraded&quot; hotel.We had no choice but to wait for another driver to come pick us up at the airport for a long while, just to go with a random driver who claimed to be sent by Hotel Ananda, and let him drive us to a hotel somewhere in New Delhi that we had no idea about.We do not know whether our alternative hotel was actually an &quot;upgrade&quot; since we had no chance to go see Hotel Ananda to compare them during our stay in Delhi. "
ananda hotel ,"ONE TO AVOID What a terrible hotel!!!!! There is nothing I can say good about this hotel. My family and myself reached at this hotel at 1.15am. Having travelled for a long time we just wanted to sleep. At the reception they were fine. They told us the basic information we needed to know and led us to the room. When we opened the room door, we were in a great shock. The room stunk of damp and the walls and ceiling was covered with moulds. My husband went down and told the reception if we could change the room because it really stunk. But they told him to adjust the night and that they will sort another room the next day. We was so tired to argue so we thought ok it is another couple of hours so we can adjust by leaving the windows open and go to sleep. My daughter wanted to sleep. So, I opened the blanket and was horrified to see bed bugs crawling everywhere. I had goose bumps as soon as I saw them. That was the last thing we wanted to see. We packed everything and went downstairs and told them we were going to leave because there were bed bugs. They apologised immediately and didn’t want to leave us instead they gave another room ‘why did they not do that in the first place’? We had no choice but to change the room because the place was new, don’t know anybody and don’t no where to get help and it seemed a risk travelling at night with a young child so we agreed to change to a better room. The second room was fine we asked them to change the bed sheets in front of us and so they did. The ‘roof top restaurant’ is a dump. I really don’t know why they call it a roof top restaurant. It wasn’t clean, the table and chairs were filthy, and they really really need to do something about it. We just stayed there for 3 nights and couldn’t wait to leave, only if we knew the place well we would have moved immediately we was like a person blindfolded in the middle of nowhere. Although the staffs understood the mistakes, apologised and tried to help we felt unhappy of the whole experience. "
ananda hotel ,Bad Experience with seepage rooms I must admit that I had a bad bad experience during my leisure time here. The hotel was undergoing some renovation and I really had to spends my nights in the seepage rooms.I would not recommend this hotel to any traveler . 
ananda hotel ,"Basic hotel unhealthy kitchen Having read positive reviews on tripadvisor we decided to stay here before traveling around north India. I really can understand why this hotel has been rated so highly on this site. It was one of the worst hotels we stayed at over three weeks. The staff were grumpy, slow and not very helpful. The room was a reasonable size but basic and not particularly clean. The bathroom was grim and the shower cold. The roof top restaurant was a converted flat roof with a staff member p*ssing in the corner. "
ananda hotel ,"cheater and careless staff. I booked it after surfing trip advisor but quit disappointed. I don’t know if these happen with me or the good review written are wrong. No pick up, upon arrival staff sleeping and can ask you for a “VOUCHER” to print at 3 A.M. when you are so tired. Then how you in a dirty room, I forget what cleanliness means here it was stained towel, smelling toilet and mosquitoes around the room. Anyways this comes to an end when I was checking out in the morning. Above all before the final and to my misery an extra 20% of the agreed room rent on the net rate (inclusive of taxes as to come) was changed. Hotel is not for Europeans or people who prefer clean place to sleep. "
ananda hotel ,a nice retreat from chaotic delhi I was picked up as promised and the driver waited even tho I forgot to give my flight number ooops. The hotel location was very good and the hotel itself was a break from the chaotic streets. The hotel was very clean and the service was excellent with a good rooftop resteraunt to relax in. 
ananda hotel ,"Friendly and simple Was greeted by their friendly driver as promised at the International airport (free).Not long after I had arrived I was asked by the helpful staff (namely Shabir) if I wanted to go sight seeing... this didn't take much convincing ;) I was whisked away not long after by their driver, singing and dancing my way around New Delhi... it was a lot of fun and he was great company!The room was spacious with two singles. Funky decor and a flat screen plasma. The air conditioner was noisy however it worked a treated at helping me escape the heat of Delhi.Unfortunately there was NO hot water... this was disappointing (I was told later that the boiler was broken and has since been repaired).The roof top restaurant is a great place to see a completely different aspect of New Delhi. The beers were cold (not something you can often rely upon) and the food was delicious :)Sharbir (front of house) was great company, very professional and assisted me with organising my onward adventures. "
ananda hotel ,"Terrible hotel for tourists. If you're a tourist read this review! I booked three rooms at Ananda after reading some of the positive reviews the hotel has received. If you're visiting India from another country, PLEASE read this review as I hope I can help you avoid an experience that we unfortunately had to go through. I cannot understand why Ananda is rated so highly. One possible explanation: many of the reviewers seem to be Indian business travelers, who have a completely different set of expectations and needs. In any case, don't stay at this hotel. You will undoubtedly be tempted by the price, which is admittedly low. But there are a TON of other cheap options in Delhi (Delhi is not an expensive city).The rooms, themselves, are comfortable enough. But the rest of the hotel has a shabby, bombed-out appearance. The rooftop is disgusting and left me with a lasting, depressing image of Delhi.The location of the hotel is terrible. Karol Bagh is full of shady characters. A routine walk around the neighborhood left me worried about getting mugged (didn't feel that way ANYWHERE else in India). Spend the extra money, and stay closer to Connaught Place. You won't regret it.Finally, and this is the most important part: DO NOT USE THEIR TRAVEL/TRANSPORTATION SERVICES! The hotel has partnered with scamming travel/transportation companies that will try and try and try again to rip you off. The story is a long one. Suffice it to say that we were quoted a price, which we agreed to. The drivers repeatedly tried to take us to places where they'd get a commission, and they got angry when we asked them politely to just take us where we wanted to go. At the end of the night, they demanded that we pay them triple the agreed upon price. We obviously refused, and they proceeded to berate us. Hotel management did not intercede on our behalf, despite admitting at one point that the company is &quot;full of crooks.&quot;All in all, this hotel was the WORST of any we stayed in during our trip. Avoid. Please. "
ananda hotel ,"Good Hotel I stayed there for one week. The location was excellent. Nearby shoping places and crowd put extra value. Room was clean, more importantly, bathroom was clean.Breakfast is sufficient and good.2nd Floor Wi-Fi was best but during my stay at 1st Floor, It was dissapointing.Staffs were friendly and cooperative. "
ananda hotel ,Delightful Such a dimaond in the rough. The staff at Ananda was amazing- incredibly helpful and attentive. The rooms were small but very clean and comfortable. Free internet and an damn good breakfast (included!). Incredible value. 
ananda hotel ,"excellent value hotel--safe comfortable friendly--would stay there again This was my first trip to India, and I went with my sister. We're both young, finished university, but still on a budget. We stayed at 5 different hotels throughout India during our two weeks there and we both felt this was by far the best. Of course it's not a 5-star hotel, but it was clean and comfortable, and we felt that we were well taken care of. I found my bed there to be the most comfortable of any hotel bed I slept in in India. The manager, Somu, was genuinely friendly and gave us little &quot;freebies&quot; here and there (internet access, some complimentary pineapple juice, extra toilet paper, helped me to not get ripped off by the international phone &quot;service&quot; around the corner) which they didn't have to do. The first night I didn't realize how to turn on the hot water, but I called the front desk and they immediately sent someone up to show me how. I don't remember the towels (as others have commented) but I usually bring my own towel when I travel anyway. Our experience at other hotels, even more expensive ones, was that every little thing cost extra. At Hotel Ananda, we were never asked for so much as a single rupee extra.At the end of our trip, we decided to stay there again, because we had enjoyed such a pleasant stay the first time. I'm so glad we did. Apparently we stayed when it was &quot;wedding season&quot; and there was a noisy wedding parade outside the hotel. Later, I went back inside and remarked how interesting it was, and the hotel manager said he was off to a friend's wedding and invited me to come along. At first I was a little hesitant, being a young woman headed off at 10 pm to who knows where, but I'm so glad I went. It was really the highlight of my trip. I was the only foreigner there at the wedding, and it was truly incredible. Even though no one knew me, I was treated like a welcomed guest, invited to join in the festivities and to eat and drink with everyone else there.Obviously not everyone will have the same experience, but I found that for a traveller on a budget, it's just as good as many other hotels that cost more. I was quite satisfied with the comfort and cleanliness of the accomodations, and I could not have asked for friendlier, more helpful staff. "
ananda hotel ,cheated by staff Hotel itself is good and located near the market but staff was the cheater. Beaware from staff tricks for making extra money from the customer by selling expensive tours. I am very depressed from the hotel staff and never recommended to others. 
ananda hotel ,"worst experience there After stayed there and other parts of India I faced worst experience in this hotel. Staff was unprofessional and misbehave with the customers. When I said them to arrange a car for same day agra tour they quote me the price 150 usd for both of us which not include the entrace fees, and the same tour I booked from the nearby travel agency in just 90 usd . food is so so. "
ananda hotel ,"Good service clean rooms excellent food. We stayed here for four pleasant nights. They picked us up at the airport in the evening as requested an got us safely through the delhi night to the hotel. When we arrived everything went smoothly - the first room we got was a bit mouldy, so we requested to change, no problem! We got a room facing the street, and it was nice and quiet during the night. The room itself was clean and nice, excellent bathroom, the ac. worked perfect. We felt completely safe there too.The restaurant at the roof served excellent food, I would recommend the ginger chicken, a nice place to have dinner in the evening. The service was very good, especially the room service guys.When we left they got us a cab to the trains station, and everything went fine, got on our train as planned. I would recommend this place as a good alternative for a quick stay in Delhi. "
ananda hotel ,"Good clean budget hotel We arrived from Jodhpur early in the morning taxi waiting as promised, when we arrived we couldn't check in until 12:00, however a room was found for us to freshen-up we weren't impressed with this room as it had a view overlooking a brick wall and a very garish bathroom. The room that we were given was fine, clean, bathroom very spacious and the furniture in the room very good quality, beds were comfy also.. Yes the towels were on the grey side but if you want white fluffy towels book a 5 star hotel At the time of our stay the hotel was undergoing renovation which made negotiating the reception area a bit tricky, but this was nearly finished when we left. The hotel restaurant was closed so meals had to be taken in the room (due to renovations and torrential rain) only ate breakfast but had no problems. No hidden room charges rate quoted was what we paid, taxi to the airport arranged no problems with that, free wi-fi all in all a good budget hotel with easy access to Delhi.. "
ananda hotel ,Excellent Hotel Not being sure what to expect as it was out first time in delhi we were pleasently surprised by both the hotel and the service. After being ripped off by people pretending to be the offical tourist office the staff went out of their way to make sure we got a refund. The manager himself spending all day in talks with the police until we finally got a full refund. Excellent staff and clean spacious rooms. 
ananda hotel ,"great location great staff great price!! As a solo traveller all the way from London i was slightly nervous about about staying in a hotel in Delhi that is more at the &quot;budget&quot; end of the scale but i have to say those worries went as soon as i stepped in the front doors.The staff were amazing, incredibly helpful, friendly, treated me like royalty and really made the holiday for me, they helped getting sim cards, currency exchange and organised trips for me, nothing was too much trouble.The rooms are simple, but very clean, comfortable and more than worth the money i paid per night for them, i stayed 7 nights, wish it could have been more, thank you ananda! *********Highly recommended*********** "
ananda hotel ,"OK hotel not so OK service I stayed just a night before catching an early morning flight. Staying at Ananda was fine, the rooms and hotel are clean, way above average in India. They were rebuilding the reception area so the lift wasn't working. I was given the promised rate (confirmed on the phone), so no issues with extra taxes and charges.However I encountered a lot of problems with extra services I requested - I asked them to book me a cab for a day and they tried charging me 100 Rs above the going rate. I neogitated it down with them and thought I was fine. However the driver was rather nasty, always trying to make an extra buck, trying to ask me for parking money at a lot with &quot;free parking&quot; sign. This kept going the whole day until I told him that unless he stops it I will simply get out of the car and not pay him. Again, this wasn't really Ananda's fault, but wel, they are responsible for choosing their partners and ensuring they stick to an acceptable standard.2nd thing that was totally annoying was when I asked them about a taxi to the airport, They tried to offer me their taxi service, but I declined and clearly stated that I want a standard pay-as-you-go cab. I thought everything was ok until I walk outside the door at 6 AM in te morning and realize they called their own cab and want to charge me their inflated price. I almost lost it there - I asked them to call a normal cab, which they said they did, but the other cab was still waiting there, probably thinking I am so pressed for time that I will just jump in and swallow the cost. After a bit of waiting, I got annoyed at them and just hailed he first autorickshaw I saw. The price was about 1/4th of what they were offering me. Normal cab would be around half. They obviously weren't that interested to satisfy me as a guest and just wanted to make extra money out of me.I would probably stay here again if I was in Delhi for a day or so, but certainly not for much longer.

ananda hotel ,"very bad hotel my personal experience in this hotel was bad , hotel was dirty and staff was bad and greedy always making extra money from tourist by. charging so many hidden and not mentioned taxes.I truly never recommend to any tourist "
ananda hotel ,"Relatively clean and quiet I'm visiting India for a month and stayed here for 1 night on a short unexpected work trip from Jaipur to Delhi. I had originally wanted to stay in the Ginger hotel but the Ananda was the only available space i found. The reviews looked good and the price was fine so my boyfriend and I took a deluxe room which they gave us for a lower price than stated on the website. The room's power went on when you put the key in a slot so it was a bit hot at first but the (loud) a.c. cooled it nicely and the room and bathroom were large and sanitized. I appreciated the western toilet for a change. The shower was cold but after a hot day I didn't mind. The room was fairly clean, with some marks on the bed sheets that were bearable (small black marks that looked like ink). The under-sheet was not fastened to the mattress and slipped a bit. The area of karol bargh is fun to explore the markets but far from most sights. Rickshaws are available right away though. I had a very sensitive stomach and ate some raita and naan from the hotel kitchen and it was tasty and clean. Good free wi-fi also. The nearby temple bells can wake you early in the morning but the hotel was basically empty, the people working there were efficient and nice, and the room felt comfortably clean and simple despite the slightly marked bedsheets and slightly grey towels. In India, and Delhi in particular, it is a good find for a reliable place to spend a night. "
ananda hotel ,"Better than first glimpse but nothing great Ok. First of all the hotel is fine. You can stay here and visit New Delhi, it's close to the metro station Krol Bagh, and about 10 minutes from Connaught Place by 3 wheel taxi which will cost you 100 rupees on a bad day and 40 if you persist a little. The hotel is not dirty, but not too clean either, lets say a bit dingy. My first reaction when I arrived from the airport was that the website sure looked good, and the reality was about 2 notches lower. This area has a busy market and also the immediate streets around the hotel are NOT illuminated at night, which made me a little nervous coming back at night., I don't know if robberies happen in the area for sure but I stayed 7 nights in this hotel and remember seeing a police man taking a statement from a couple of foreign travelers about some kind of incident at least twice during that week. The market that is nearby is interesting, but most of what you see you could find at home too, as it is a busy market area, from about 5am the noise in the street would wake me up, so I tried to go to sleep early. Also the hotel is a bit of a construction site, they are installing an elevator, but looks like progress is slow, for the moment there are only stairs. They offer breakfast on the rooftop, which to me sounded fabulous but the rooftop as well is another construction site with piles of debris and bricks, and piping and cement and who knows what else. On the rooftop they also have the &quot;restaurant&quot; which in reality is a kind of open air lean-to. After my first breakfast on the rooftop, I never returned, there's other places nearby that offer good and reasonable breakfast options.As for the room, the A/C was great. I would return late afternoon each day, soaked in perspiration and immediately enter the room, turn on the A/C and jump in the shower. One reason was because I never experienced hot water in the hotel. Just cold and less cold, so coming in from the street was the best moment to shower. As for the towels, they are supposed to be white, each day I had three in my room and would examine each one, one by one to look for the less stained and almost clean towel. Usually I could find one that was acceptable.The worse part of the visit to Ananda Hotel was the checkout. They had offered me a rate of 1980 rupees per night for a deluxe room. But at checkout they wanted to charge me 2200 rupees. Luckily I had the email confirming the rate with me. Also the gentleman at the counter tried to tell me I had stayed 8 nights, so we counted the nights together on our fingers 3 times until he finally realized that it was just 7 nights. I had ordered a taxi through the hotel to take me to the airport, at a cost of 350 rupees. Not one block from the hotel, the taxi broke down. I jumped out, at started to flag another one. It was the most jarring uncomfortable ride I had had in India, I think a 3 wheeler would have been better. Best thing about this hotel is the free wifi internet. "
ananda hotel ,"Good home base We stayed here for 3 nights upon arrival in India. We had a comfortoble room with spacious bathroom. Everything was very clean and functioning properly. the staff immediatly put up two extra matresses for our small childeren. Room service catering was very quick, the food was tasty, plenty and not expensive to Delhi standards. The owner of this hotel was very helpfull working out our travelplan and transportissues. In all, a very good home base for travels in Northern India. "
ananda hotel ,"Relaxing stay at Ananda Hotel Our booking via venere.com was successful at the first try.The staff was very friendly &amp; helpful and the rooms were clean, although the elevator was being exchanged we didn't hear it in our rooms.The location is not at the centre but very easy reachable via tuck tuck etc. The Jessa Ram Hospital (Karol Bagh) is known and the hotel is 300m away from it.It was really a nice stay at Ananda an we can recommend it. "
ananda hotel ,"A cool and quiet Place for Business People in the Bustling Market of Karol Bagh I was very happy with the hospitality and the room service and the kind of privacy they offered to me . Since I was traveling for business purpose I had to say the staff was very cordial with my clients also they never objected the continuous arrivals of my client . And the plus point is the parking , there are ample of parking place and as every one knows Karol Bagh is a crowded place so a good parking is an exception . I would definitlely recommend this hotel for business people ,it offers great value for money . "
ananda hotel ,Clean great food and friendly/helpful staff I had read quite a few reviews on various hotels in Delhi and I decided to opt for this one as all in all the reviews appeared extremely positive. Also price wise it was one of the more cheaper options. Much to my friends and my own delight it lived up to it's review reputation as a clean hotel with extremely friendly staff. As promised the taxi was waiting for us at the airport free of charge and I have to say the quality of the food in the restaurant was very impressive. It just so happened that one of the managers was also a tour agent which makes for a great selling point in the hotel but in all honestly when you are on a tight timeline it genuinely did make things a whole lot easier. 
ananda hotel ,"Ananda is an oasis Ananda was an oasis in the middle of the bustling city and some of the things I was grateful for included courteous, highly professional staff, an impeccably clean bathroom with steaming hot water and internet access. The lobby and room had a distinctive sense of style and I enjoyed my stay in the Ananda. "
ananda hotel ,"Excellent service great value highly recommend this hotel My experience at the Hotel Ananda was exceptional. The service was outstanding - the hotel arranged for an airport pick-up, the staff was so friendly and helpful and anytime that I needed anything, they were more than willing to help. The room was clean and comfortable and was at a great price. The hotel even has Wi-fi!I really just can't say enough about the staff at the hotel. It was like being among family and I definitely recommend this hotel. "
ananda hotel ,"Clean simple and friendly Rooms are not luxurious but definitely more than basic, good bed, spacious bathroom and clean. I stayed two nights, both nights I had warm water, and the air-conditioning was working well. As requested the hotel had arranged airport pick up, complimentary. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The location is good, not too much traffic, easy ride with the tuk-tuk to the ‘centre ‘and the metro station around the corner. If you don’t mind breakfast in bed (there is no breakfast room so breakfast is served in the room, at the time requested) and are looking for a friendly and clean place to stay this hotel offers good value for money, especially in Delhi. "
ananda hotel ,"fantastic stay in ananda hotel ananda is a newly built hotel as it seems to, with all new amenities.All latest facilities, like wi-fi, 24 hours hot water, courteous staff24 hours food facility.we had our personal function in Delhi, so I booked this hotel for my relatives and friends , who came from all over India and they enjoyed a lot, thats what reviews I got from my relatives.So, i can say its a place worth staying and spending my hard earnest money.Money wise also it was cheap and best.my best wishes for all Ananda staff.Thanks "
ananda hotel ,"Friendly and relaxed environment I was visiting India with my family and wanted a clean and reasonably priced hotel. This was the first visit to India for my wife and 3 kids and therefore wanted a trouble-free hotel which can cater for all our needs. I could not have asked for any more. The location is good, about 35 minutes from the Airport and 15 minutes from New Delhi Railway Station by car. The rooms were clean and spacious. We had a suite room and a deluxe room.Staff were very friendly and helpful. They had a computer in reception which the kids were allowed to use.Room service was good and prompt.For our stay in Delhi we had hired a driver and therefore did not use the public transport nearby.If travelling to this hotel, you should mention the landmark of the hospital in the hotel's address. "
ananda hotel ,"a quiet clean place in the buzzing capital of india i stayed in the ananda hotel for 2 days.as i have been traveling through india a lot i know what most of the hotels are like.but i was surprised with this one. i enjoyed my stay.the rooms are very clean,big and comfortable.nice bathtube and big windows.the staff was very friendly and the service excellent.the hotel is situated in one of delhis shopping areas-karol bagh.and the metro station is just walking distance.i was very happy with the hotel and recommend anybody who travels to india to have a look at hotel.enjoy your trip to india.its an amazing place. "
ashok country resort ,"Good hotel for an overnight stop We spent two separate nights at this hotel as part of our tour of India.As others have said, it is heavily used by and geared to tour groups, There are a lot of arrivals and departures in the night and early morning, which may be disturbing to individual travellers.This is a good hotel though. Our room was pleasant and the bathroom clean. The food was good and the service very friendly and welcoming, except at the front desk where staff were a little abrupt.The gardens are very well maintained, quiet and peaceful. On our second visit our enjoyment of them was increased by the beautiful decorations and fairy lights for a wedding reception to be held that evening.We would not hesitate to return for an overnight stay. "
ashok country resort ,"Characterless The Ashok is reasonably close to the airport. Getting there is rather odd, you have to drive down a dirt track and the hotel is at the end - we were in transit, so it didn't matter much, but you wouldn't want to stay there if you were on a trip to see the sights of Delhi. The hotel and rooms (although large) are characterless. Service in the restaurant was OK, as was the food. When we arrived at midnight we were unable to get a beer - bar closed and no beers in the mini-bar! Reception did however find us a couple of beers which were delivered to our room. "
ashok country resort ,away from the bustle of delhi useful stopover if visiting Delhi. good pool and excellent food. road works when i was there so getting to and from was a bit of a problem but was over come. taxi ride away from nightlife in delhi 
ashok country resort ,Old but comfortable On a five star scale rating this hotel would qualify as a high end 3 star hotel. It's an older resort style hotel but has few amenities. The building and the grounds are surrounded by a tall wall which is what seperates the front of the building from the busy street. We stayed in a room facing away from the street and did not have any complaints about the noise. The bathrooms were clean and so were the linenes. There are nice big flat panel televesions with tons of local cables and news stations to watch. The grounds are manicured and well kept and the pool was clean. Since it was the winter season when we were there we opted not to go for a swim but the pool itself seemed nice. The gym is a bit cramped and dark and equipment seriously out of date but if you are just looking for descent cardio equipment it should get the job done. The breakfast served was minimal but all you can eat. Overall our stay was pleasant and would consider staying again. 
ashok country resort ,"Total Rip Off This is one of the nicer hotels in Delhi and is conveniently located quite near both the domestic and international airport. While the rate on the asiarooms website was fantastic, guests should be warned that this hotel charges astronomical rates for its taxi service, so this certainly would not suit the budget traveller. Where the pre-paid taxi from the international airport to the hotel charged 240 rupees, the hotel then charged 600 rupees plus tax for their own taxi service back. (This is more in line with what one would expect to pay in Europe for the same distance). However, the taxi service was very timely and efficient.Food and drinks are also very expensive here. Where a bottle of water would only cost 15 rupees elsewhere, this hotel charges about 100 rupees, working out at about €1.40. The quality of the food in the restaurant is substandard for India. Dinner consists of a self service buffet of food which has been sitting for hours heating in a bamberree and breakfast is the same. Very disappointing. The dinner works out at three times the cost that you would pay for a lovely dinner served in a good quality restaurant in other parts of Delhi. As this hotel is quite a bit outside the main centre of Delhi it is not a good location for anyone who is interested in using it as their main base for sightseeing. I would recommend flagging a rickshaw from the main road up from the hotel to the city centre which should cost about 230 rupees (insist on the meter being used).Expense aside, the hotel is very clean and the grounds are beautiful. It is a very relaxing place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of downtown Delhi. The pool is lovely too.The hotel is fine for a one night stopover to get to the airport. Bring plenty of money! "
ashok country resort ,"Much nicer than an airport hotel! We stayed on our first and last nights in India, it was our airport hotel. There was no queue at check in and our room was super, with a very smart marble bathroom. There was also a nice garden (for a late night jet-lagged stroll). We found the restaurant to be quite convenient, when the buffet is on, that's what you have to have - otherwise you choose from a menu. There is food available late, from a reduced menu. The food was nice, with Indian and Western choices. We also enjoyed the breakfast, with plenty of choice available. The gift shop was small but pleasant (although they did try to sell us an elephant with its tusks missing). "
ashok country resort ,"Very Good Hotel Really a good hotel. Food,services room ambience everthing was really great. Not very close to town but good place to stay. "
ashok country resort ,"""Welcome to our beautiful hotel. Now pay up!"" We stayed at this hotel in April 2009.The positive aspects are:the staff is very polite.Addtionally, the Ashok is very beautiful and at least when we were there, quiet.It also has a lovely pool, despite the smell of sewage in the air at times.(I wonder what they water the plants with?)Although the rooms certainly aren’t 5 star standards by any stretch of the imagination (no hot water when we were there) they were comfortable, had soft beds and large cable plasma TV’s. All this aside, however…The hotel is overpriced and its directorial policy - greedy.The rates changed when we were there (they went lower because we were there at the end of the high season), but they still charged us for the higher rate quoted in our e-mails. During our entire stay, it felt as though the Hotel was only trying to get as much money out of us as possible.In the 30 hours we were there, (we paid a very expensive day rate as well as our overnight stay) not once were we offered as much as a complimentary glass of water. Instead the guests are charged (6 times the normal price compared to anywhere else in India) .It just made us feel a little taken advantage of since the hotel is in the middle of nowhere.And it was hot. Furthermore, just to use the internet, the price is almost 3 times that of other hotels in India and the minimum charge was only for an hourly rate (not half hour). At every turn, one feels that the hotel is doing any little connivance to get as much money out of the guest as possible. Finally, on check-out, the desk manager sent a boy to look at our mini-bar in case we were being dishonest with our declaration. It was a bit insulting, especially since we had been so courteous to everyone at the hotel.All kidding aside, we spent over 19,000 rupees in the hotel for one overnight stay, a day rate, and a modest dinner. We certainly weren't about to rip off a bag of potato chips! I think these practices are put into effect because the hotel is really an establishment for tour guests being offloaded by buses who are there for a short time. For privately booked couples, however, spending some time in the hotel, one feels pretty targeted. Even the restaurant upstairs was the only one in India in the 3 and half weeks we were there which added an additional tax in an attempt to make the prices on the menu seem lower than they were.Plus the lights are on full during dinner, so it is anything but cozy despite the fine décor.I mentioned a lot of this to the manager and informed him that had things been done differently we would have eaten dinner there instead of at the airport on departure. He thanked my for my honesty, something which was commendable and admitted that he had heard some of this before. The pictures look great, but the hotel doesn't exhibit much class despite how beautiful it looks or what its prices are.A hotel with class does not send a boy to double check the mini bar right in front of its guests!A hotel with class, which is secluded, should not over -charge 6 times the normal price for water which is a necessity- not a luxury despite its affordability. It leaves one with a bad feeling.Should you stay there? Well, it is comfortable enough, just don’t expect to be treated as anything more than a pay check. "
ashok country resort ,"Poor Value We (husband, wife and teenage daughter) stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for one night only - fortunately. Probably the poorest value for money place we stayed in during our two week holiday in Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi. Given the relatively high rates, I'd rate the resort as below average at best. "
ashok country resort ,"No Complaints The Ashok is basically a transit hotel used by holiday companies to accommodate travellers for one or two nights on their way in and out of India. It is set in tidy and secure grounds, a short ride from the airport. During my stay, I found the hotel staff to be polite and helpful. The food at both breakfast and dinner was extremely nice although service was sometimes a little disorganised. The first floor rooms in the hotel are rather dark and dismal and in need of some refurbishment. The ground floor rooms are a lot nicer, cleaner and more modern. The pool area looked very nice. Reception changed cash (Euros) for us quickly and easily, at a reasonably good rate, and gave us a proper receipt for the transaction. If you want to do online check-in for your return flight, the hotel has a single computer in reception that you can use. The internet connection is very slow. "
ashok country resort ,"cold hotel with nice garden The homepage of the Ashok Country Resort promises more than the hotel can provide. The garden is very nice, but it isn't calm because of the traffic outside. It looks so nice from outside and in the lobby. But the room was not very clean and the beds were clammy. The room were also cold, the small heater did his best, but this wasn't enough. The food in the restaurant is everage, the breakfast small. I was really disappointed. "
ashok country resort ,Very Average Stayed 1 night at the beginning and 1 night at the end of the Kuoni Taj Tour. Was nice and close to the airport so the trip to and from was very easy. The hotel seemed adequate for our hectic schedule as there was very little leisure time. The rooms on the ground floor are not as nice as the rooms on the 2nd floor as we discovered on our return visit. Grounds and pool seem nice but didn't have the time to explore that much. The food was reasonable for both dinner and breakfast. The porters were very helpful in carrying and collecting baggage however I have a feeling this was due to the group being Kuoni and not standard practise for the hotel. Changing money was a nightmare. They have to get authorisation for Travellers Cheques from a bank before they will change the money which obviously can take time. Also they never seemed to actually have money at reception we were told come back in half an hour .... which with a busy schedule was not ideal! 
ashok country resort ,the last place to stay in delhi i was supposed to stay for 4 nights but ran after 3 could not take it anymore. The worst rooms i have ever stayed in. i've even stayed in motels with better service and rooms. The only thing good was some of the foods served in the restaurant. 
ashok country resort ,"a shocking experience We were arriving late from Bangkok with my girlfriend and on our way to Agra, so we thought we'll stay near by the airports. I thought to stay in a nice hotel, not having huge expectations but for this price at least expect to get a decent room...well not even close of it.The welcome at the airport was weird, we had to look for the hotel driver in the line of all the other hotels driver at the exit gate for 30 minutes before the guy showed up, then it complain to us about the delay in addition of being plain rude...The room was horrible, look 20 years old, not even a proper mattress on the bed, the bed sheets and towels were 10 years old...We ordered some room service at 01:30 am, big mistake, it took 1 hour for a club sandwich to arrive and it look like they went to buy it in a small food stall on the road side...When we checked out we where not asked how was our stay or gave any comment card or else, meaning that they don't care what you think, just show the money, and after you pay not even a thank you for staying there or else.We then jumped in the car back to the airport after that I charged the luggages in the trunk myself as the concierge didn't even move off the door to help or propose is help.I was happy to be out of this crappy place, they have no clue of how to run their business and obviously what hotel business is all about. "
ashok country resort ,"Good for being close to the Airport Great hotel, very close to Delhi International airport, ideal for a 1 night stay before an early flight.The large pool area is relaxing, and they served a good and varied snack menu since we didn’t want to wait until the main restaurant opened at 7pm. This is a buffet style restaurant, fine if you are hungry enough, but not for light meals.Whilst I was relaxing on my sunbed, it started to rain. There was a flurry of activity, and the next minute I had 4 staff surrounding me putting up a huge gazebo. A bit embarrassing to lie in the middle of it all going on, but it saved me having to go indoors.The bedroom was quite small but functional with a nice view over the garden "
ashok country resort ,nice pool and grounds We stayed at the Ashok as part of a tour. We found this Hotel good as part of the tour but for independant travellers would probably be too far out of town.No-where to eat but at the Hotel - evening meal was ok for one or two nights and we found the breakfast very good.Our room was quite nice but some rooms are probably a little noisy as this Hotel is on the main road. There was a kettle in the room.The pool area and grounds are very nice-not as posh as some of the Hotels in town but we found this place ok and would not hesitate to stay here again. 
ashok country resort ,"Not worth paying We booked our stay for only one night in this hotel. We reserved a pick up service and upon arrival at the airport, we didn't see any one so we called at the hotel. The hotel driver said he was there waiting for us but we told him that didn't see anyone so the driver was upset and complaint and try to have an argument with us. He push us to talk to the hotel just to tell the hotel that he didn't lie. How strange. The hotel looks quite old and the room we got was not very clean. For the price we paid, we could see at the beginning that it was way too expensive. The room was not very clean and look quite old. Even their towels are so old. For paying more than 200USD, it does not worth!Do not order anything from Room Service, half of the menu are not available and it took about an hour to deliver. We order one sandwich and one simply pakora which is very easy to made, they deliver the first one after half an hour and sandwich was delivered after another more than 30 mins and the taste was quite bad too. Breakfast was quite bad too and even the check out, staff keep asking us where we are going then other questions which they suppose to communicate but at the end, they keep asking the same thing until we left.Overall, we are quite disappointed for choosing this hotel, the price they charge is really too expensive than the service and the quality they offerred, TRULY. "
ashok country resort ,"Convenient Hotel for Airport and a Great Escape After a week in Inida experiencing the Rajasthan and Agra, this hotel was a very welcome rest away from the hustle and bustle prior to leaving Delhi.We turned up on spec and were presented with a good room at a reasonable rate (£63). The well manicured gardens and the relaxed bar and restaurant were just what we needed.The hotel arranged our airport drop off and wake up call for 3am very efficiently.In summary, a good place to stay if you're flying the next day or wish to get away from the crowds. "
ashok country resort ,enchanting lovely grounds we arrived at this hotel on a kuoni golden triangle tour.upon initial impressions i was captivated by the gorgeous well kept gardens and the lovelly swimming pool.it is a tranquil retreat after say a day of the hustle and bustle of old dehli.please note if you drink wine the price is astronomical.staff friendly but we encoutered a problem when they tried to charge us for our transfer to the airport which was sorted through kuoni!!!!but you expect these tryu ons in india.food was good.i loved the omletts at breakfast.the rooms were very well decorated.so overall this is a lovely hotel with truly lovely gardens 
ashok country resort ,No Hot Water - Evasive Manager We booked this hotel as it was near the airport and was supposedly a very high standard. We checked in at lunchtime and the manager greeted us an said &quot;any problems come and see me&quot;. They then charged the full amount of our stay on our credit card - very suspicious.There was no hot water in the room - asked at reception - told to wait a bit an it would be fixed. An hour later still no hot water - call manager who on arriving at our room tried to maintain the water was hot!!!! He then suggested a different room but again the water was cold. I eventually lost my temper and called another hotel (the Raddison to stay there). It then took me 30 minutes of very vocal complaining in reception to get my money back.On leaving the hotel the porter told me the boiler had ben giving trouble for several weeks. If a hotel has a problem I expect them to be honest with their guests. 
ashok country resort ,"Convenient Stayed here as part of the Kuoni Taj Tour. Although the hotel is on the outskirts of Delhi, it is a great escape from the city and after full dys of sightseeing it was great to be in such a calm place.The pool was nice and the grounds were really well kept. I can see why they chose this hotel for us. Due to the location the hotel is the main option for food, unless you get a taxi. However, the food here was good. We were generally pleased with this hotel. "
ashok country resort ,"Convenient for the airport Like the previous entry we stayed at the Ashok at the beginning and end of the Kuoni &quot;Taj Tour&quot;. It was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli. The rooms were clean and comfortable although some of our group reported that their room smelt musty. The pool was pleasant and the staff were fine. The buffet breakfast had a mix of Western and Indian food and was satisfactory. We had no complaints about the hotel or staff and it was particularly convenient for the airport, only about 15 minutes away. However it was too far out from Dehli, we would have preferred to be closer. Also there wasn't any other restaurants nearby so we had to eat in the hotel. The dinner buffet wasn't really very good and it was relatively expensive for India.We got a taxi into Dehli two evenings and went to the sound and light show at the Fort which was enjoyable.I wouldn't particularly recommend this hotel but if it is part of your trip then it will be fine after all holidays are often what you make them. I certainly didn't find it as bad as some of the other reviewers have suggested. Happy to give further details if required. "
ashok country resort ,"Handy for the airport We stayed at the Ashok at the beginning and end of the Kuoni &quot;Taj Tour&quot;. It was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli. The rooms were pleasantly decorated, clean and comfortable. The pool was lovely and very nice to sit beside with a cold beer. We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts which had a mix of Western and Indian food. We had no complaints about the hotel or staff and would recommend it as a useful stopping point going to or from the airport. We phoned for a radio cab to take us to the Sound and Light at the Red Fort (well worth seeing) and found this a convenient and not too expensive way of getting into town. "
ashok country resort ,"Not a bad 'transit' hotel Not bad as a transit hotel for 1 night but wouldn't stay any longer than that. Stuck out in the suburbs with nothing in the general vicinity. 10 mins from the airport.Must request a 'quiet' room as this hotel is located right next to a busy road, what is it with the locals and their need to blast their horn at every living thing they pass regardless of the time of night!Had a noisy room 1st stay and 9 days later had a quiet one - miles better. Decent size though aircon pretty forlorn and controls didn't seem to work. Clean and tidy.Breakfast and dinner buffet OK. Meagre supplies in the bathroom and shower never passed lukewarm on either stay. Plasma TV (didn' turn it on). Nice garden, pool looks OK, little shop is rubbish. Free safety deposit box on reception.Had to leave at 3.30am and got wake up call at 3.00am, found reception fully staffed but weren't offered tea/coffee until rep arrived and asked why.Popular transit hotel and I think rooms can be hired for 1/2 day/night. Guests coming and going at all hours and somewhat selfishly they make no attempt to avoid disturbing everyone else within a 5 room vicinity. Perhaps some QUIET PLEASE notices might be in order.I'd stay there again if I needed a stopover but not for a proper holiday - too far away from the centre of Delhi (45kms I think, in the rushhour traffic that distance takes forever). "
ashok country resort ,"Avoid at all cost! This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I had booked the room several months prior to the stay and had email confirmation of the exact cost. When checking in they tried to charge us $50 more for the room until I showed them my email. Next, the bathroom had a strong smell of urine, the room smelled of mold and the air conditioner made the smell even worse. The mattress was about 2&quot; thick. I have had more comfort camping in a sleeping bag. This hotel may be convenient due to its close proximity to the Delhi international airport, but I recommend avoiding it at all cost. It is simply not worth it. "
ashok country resort ,"Stay only if your objective is proximity to the airport The positives were the food in the restaurant (quite good) and the pretty grounds, including the pool and resident peahen. Somehow they managed to have green grass and trees in spite of the pollution.The negatives were the room and the dust inside. The public computer in the foyer was filthy with grime and dust. The pollution in the area near the hotel/airport is horrendous and it seems a losing battle at this hotel. Although I had been in India a week, the air quality really bothered me here and not elsewhere.The room was the bare essentials. It reminded me of Eastern Europe in the 80s.I had a lot of time to kill at this hotel before my flight and there really wasn't anything to do. The gift shop was not enticing. The hotel is not easily accessible to sights. "
ashok country resort ,Nice quiet hotel not far from Delhi airport This was the nicest of the 4 hotels we stayed in on our tour of India. It had a lovely pool area and a nice restaurant (it was upstairs and no lift but that was the only problem for one of our party who is less mobile). The owner of the hotel was in attendance and keen to speak to all the guests and made sure everything was up to standard. 
ashok country resort ,"an oasis in the culture shock thats delhi this is a very nice hotel the rooms are clean and large it was cold so the staff put heaters in the rooms, the bathroom was a little old but clean all the same. the only problem was that they only put the hot water on at certain times of the day so its either cold or tepid showers overall a nice place "
ashok country resort ,"Ok for a quick stay but only OK Stayed here on our first night in India on Voyages Jules Verne Golden Triangle tour. The hotel chosen, I suspect, because of its proximity to the airport. When we arrived, Delhi was very smoggy and that atmosphere pervaded the hotel. Our room smelt very smoky, but that could have been because of the terrible air in Dehli city. I couldn't help worrying about the athletes coming here for the Commonwealth Games, I hope they clean up their air quality before then! Anyway, back, back to the hotel - the room was adequate but beds really uncomfortable. The bathroom was OK and other facilities in the hotel were rather limited. There is a small bar and a small restaurant area. Breakfast had an interesting variety of foods. The cooked omlettes looked great and there were good yogarts, fruits and cakes. There was also an assortment of curry based dishes and other cooked things too. In short, this hotel is OK to use as a base but don't expect to really enjoy the ambiance. The motorrway is very close and somewhat noisy during the night but all in all, this hotel was a convenient stop-over en route to more exciting places. "
ashok country resort ,"better then rest on airport I stayed there because It was near the aiport where I arrived at midnight and had a flight leaving next day at eight.My first iimpression from the room, was quit good, exspected it worser for 7400 rupees. But the shower didn't work , bath did.And it was very noiscy , Its located near the highway and even in the middle of the night the noice was dusturbing.It was very near the airport. The hotel taxi was parked 10 minutes walk away and with paying the carpark it took 40 minutes before we arrived at the hotel. My flight was delayed, ended up staying for 3 hours.a good advise for whn you tay shortly, ask or you can nagociate the price. "
ashok country resort ,"Fine brief stay We had a very brief stay at the hotel, but it was fine. We arrived around ten in the evening and they had the correct rooms (twin beds, non-smoking) ready. Everything in the room worked fine. We left for an all day trip to Agra at 6:30am the next day and breakfast doesn't start until 7:00, but they let us have tea and toast before we left which was nice of them. We used the half day rate that day and it was great to come back from the long trip to Agra and shower and change before our flight to the US. The long problem we had was the car they sent to the airport to pick us up was designed for two people and little luggage. There were four of us and a lot of luggage! Instead of waiting for another vehicle my husband crammed it all in and we sat on each others laps. Fortunately, it is a ten minute ride to the hotel from the airport! I don't know whose mistake it was, but on the return journey we had a much larger vehicle. "
ashok country resort ,"The worst hotel we stayed at in 3 weeks in India On a recent trip to India we stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for our final night before flying home to the UK. During our 3 week trip to Inida we stayed in a variety of accommodation from 5 star hotels to simple hostels and this hotel was by far the worst place we stayed in. The service from the reception was nothing short of rude and the prices for drinks and food within the hotel were 5 star hotel prices, had this been a five star hotel with five star food it might have been reasonable! Whilst on the subject of prices this brings us to the outragious prices they charged for an airport transfer. Earlier in our trip in Delhi we were able to hire an air conditioned taxi for a whole day for the price this hotel charged for a 10 minute ride to the airport, knowing that being on a busy main road there is little to no chance of customers being able to get a taxi from elsewhere. Together with a dark and dismal room with terribly uncomfortable beds this was a very disappoining end to an otherwise fantastic trip to India! "
ashok country resort ,"Good value stay in Delhi We used the Ashok for a first night in India and were very satisfied. The pickup from the airport worked well and the hotel was comfortable and clean with a good pool where we got over any jet lag. It is not a 5*, but then you are not paying 5* prices, and it seems to be good value for Delhi. "
ashok country resort ,"India that works 3 am is not a good time to arrive anywhere, for sure not India. The hotel provides an well signed, adequate and reliable transfer for IGI Airport to hotel, transfer time 15 mins. The rooms are big, clean and fairly comfortable. Feeding arrangements are good, but beware hordes of French groups on tour, and Kazak aircrews on layover. A good feature is the attractive garden with good swimming pool, plus a slightly under-standard gym.When you re-book, don't believe the Front Office staff when they say you are re-booked: get it in writing.A short stay helps us to prepare for the assault on the senses which India is about to bring. "
ashok country resort ,"A welcome return to the 21st century after eight nights in heritage hotels Privately owned and operated, this full service hotel is located between city and airport and caters to Indian businessmen and European tour groups. Upon arrival one can not help but be impressed by the beautiful marble floor and stair case of the two story lobby with its massive crystal chandelier. The owner's son sits on a desk in the lobby and is very accommodating, as is the staff. Our ground level, well lit, spacious room was very nicely furnished, and the king size bed with a comfortable, soft mattress, cushy sheets and pillows sported mirrored headboards. A desk, mini-bar, over stuffed chairs, glass top table, TV, phone, Wi-Fi Internet connection, quiet A/C, tea/coffee making pot and supplies,large closet, and Indian area rug made for a comfortable stay. The bathroom with floor to ceiling granite tiles was stocked with ample towels and a standard assortment of toiletries incl Kleenex. Sink and shower chrome fixtures bear witness of years of scrubbing. All was spotlessly clean, yet the grouting in the tub/wall joint was somewhat unsightly. A window onto a garden corner promised a quiet night, but that was not to be. Two European tour groups partied boisterously in two rooms with doors open near us until way past midnight while awaiting their transfer to the airport. Equally staff dealing with their luggage carried on loud conversations and did not be concerned with quietness, The marble floors made the long hallway into an echo chamber.A large, clean pool in the vast, manicured gardens invited for a cooling swim. A well stocked gym, gift shop, lobby lounge with giant screen TV, and the upstairs restaurant with a very pleasing ambiance rounded out the facility. Indian, Chinese, and Continental food was offered buffet style and a-la-carte, and it was very good, as was the breakfast.All in all, were it not for the racket during the night, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. "
ashok country resort ,"ashok country resort as hotel rates go in delhi,this is a real surprise,we paid £75.00 per room per night,and that included b/fast and airport pickup and drop.Hotel is in a quiet location near the airport,rooms are big and comfortable,staff are polite and nvery helpful,food is not bad either.swimming pool is clean and big in size,gardens are well kept.Only minus points are 1.no live entertainment,2.very basic shop 3.can get crowded,as this hotel is used by travel agencies,as a Delhi transit hotel. "
ashok country resort ,"Excellent calm in the storm We stayed here two nights in late March 2007. An excellent hotel! I worried at first, because we didn’t see the hotel’s driver at the Delhi airport anywhere in the crowd holding a sign with my name on it. When I took a second walk through the area, though, he was there, and helped us with our bags, led us to the hotel’s shiny new SUV, and drove us safely to the resort. The room was clean and spacious, and staff was helpful and polite. Breakfast buffet was good, and lunch was excellent in the resort’s restaurant. The well-maintained grounds, with lots of flowers (a treat for us, having come from a long Alaska winter), a pool, and benches, gave us the breathing space we needed after a long flight. The entire resort is fenced off and so it feels insulated from the hubbub and traffic. Its small shop sold high-quality souvenirs and clothing. They let us take the salwar tops back to our room to try them on. Checked my email in the lobby, bought bottled water to take with us on our next leg (8-hour drive to Nainital), and had them book us a room for our return through Delhi at another hotel (as Ashok Country Resort was booked)—Hotel Deemarks nearby. Their recommendation for that hotel turned out to be fine. I highly recommend Ashok Country Resort! "
ashok country resort ,"Clean Fairly quiet location just on the fringe of the city, stunning gardens with a clean pool &amp; loud peacock. I found the Reception staff to be aloof and not very welcoming esp. as we were there on the first night of our tour and had to rely on them to exchange to our first rupees. The room was fine with clean crisp bedding and a descent size, though the view was of a wall &amp; the window didn't quiet fit the frame but due to the nets and curtains we didn't have any flying visitors. As we also spent our last night in India there, so we enjoyed a banana split while we sat under the sun by the pool -highly recommend. "
ashok country resort ,"small but ok Stayed here on 1st and 7th day of the Kuoni Taj Tour. It's mainly clean, everything worked in the bedroom, although we had a very noisy fridge !! The bathroom looked a bit tired and had a very mouldy shower curtain The bar area is very small and there is not much of a sitting area. The restaurant was fine and the food good for both dinner and breakfast.Nicest thing were the gardens with loads of flowers .Pool looked ok too.Reception staff not the most helpful I have ever come accross though! "
ashok country resort ,"Average hotel When we arrived in Dehli we went straight to the hotel. The room was cold and the bed damp, we had to request an additional heater in our room! Breakfast the following morning was okay. The staff were helpful and polite. This is an average tourist hotel. Good value for money. "
ashok country resort ,"Good place to sleep after your flight This is a good place to sleep after a long flight. The rooms were clean and quiet, bathroom clean and adequate. Good varied buffet breakfast. Lovely gardens, and the pool looked nice, though it was too cool to try it in December. Staff were pleasant and helpful. I wish I had been able to have a massage in their health centre, but they were booked solid. "
ashok country resort ,"Nice overnight stay After checking lots of reviews we decided to stay in the Ashok.The comment about the dew-smell is correct, but I think it is not only the rooms which cannot be opened and are only airconditioned, but also the smell outside was damp. There was a huge cloud over Delhi and no fresh air in the garden.The rooms are nice, the bathroom a little old. The people at the reception very polite and gave us our call to the airline free.The restaurant indeed advised to take the buffet at 563 rupees each, but also mentioned the separate dishes and their price. As far as I could count, this made the buffet a better price, and the food was really good.We didn't have breakfast, as our planes left very early. We were taken to the airport on time, and I forgot to mention, also were received at arrival. This shuttle-service was included in the price.Considering the need to stay only overnight between flights, I think this is a good place close to the airport. "
ashok country resort ,disappointing hotel We stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for the first and last night of our Golden Triangle tour and again for a final night after our extention to Shimla. The room we had for the first night was OK the second stay was not so nice but had a better view over the garden. It also had information about the Beauty Shop..had we known about it the first day we could have had a massage as the hotel is very isolated and there is absolutely NOTHING in the vicinity..........we walked to the local village.... took 20 minutes not 5 as reception told us...BIG mistake.......The final night we paid a supplement for a &quot;Club&quot; room and it was the worst of the three.....It did have a big plasma screen which only had one English language channel........we had only 1 tea bag and 1 sachet of coffee....the bathroom was grubby...the toilet very noisy and the strange smell was there too.The food in the restaurant is mediocre during the day and in the evening but the buffet breakfast is not too bad. Because of it's location there is no choice but to eat there.The only good thing about it is the proximity to the airport. .. 
ashok country resort ,"disappointing This was the most disappointing hotel we stayed in in India . The room was not cleaned properly , smelt a bit damp , no information in room about hotel facilities , poor outlook onto courtyard , no hairdryer in the room , chipped paintwork and rather dreary breakfast , only redeeming features were friendly staff , nice grounds and near the airport, suggest try elsewhere , the Radisson is also near the airport and far superior . "
ashok country resort ,"Nice room terrible restuarant! Room was lovely, with a large screen plasma! Very clean. Far too expensive for what it was (I paid £76). The grounds are very nice but the buffet restuarant is terrible! The chicken I had was hardly cooked and they didn't really seem to care. Good for the airport and the atmosphere feels very relaxed. "
ashok country resort ,"A true Oasis! This hotel is a top quality hotel! The representative picked us up from the hotel with a placard, carried in our luggage, and gave us a warm welcome. The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated. The pool is large and refreshing in the midst of hot Dehli. The restaurant is delicious (a delicious indian breakfast buffet is included) and there is a nice lounge area open 24 hours if you need some masala chai or a beer late at night. The internet access is fast but only one computer is available for guests. So, you may have to wait for a turn. The hotel staff were all very friendly and they even agreed to hold one of our bags for us while we did our golden triangle tour. Finally the proximity to the airport makes it an easy place to stay at the beginning and end of your journey. The only downside is the distance to the city - it is about 45 - 60 minutes and costs about $25 by taxi. So, it may not be the best place to stay for your entire journey if you plan to go in and out of Dehli everyday. Enjoy! "
ashok country resort ,"Ok but not for a second time We (family, two children of 15 and 18) stayed twice in this hotel; one night at arrival from the airport and flying the other day and a second time two nights to see Delhi before we left India to go home. The hotel is comfortable near the both airports, nice when you arrive in the middle of the night and need sleep. What you see in brochures and on internet, you also see in reality. It is a green surrounding with lovely green lawns and palm trees. The rooms have a good size; on the bathrooms you see the complex is older, but we have no complaints about it.The restaurant is moderate. The first time the breakfast was very poor, because there were hardly any guests. The second time, when there were some groups, it was sufficient. When having dinner, you are offered the buffet. You have to ask to eat à la carte. It looks like the policy of the hotel is to promote the buffet! Although it looks like we enjoyed the stay in this hotel, I wouldn't recommend it. You get what you see in the brochures, but what I didn't like was what you smell and feel in the hotel and in your room. When you enter the hotel and your room it smells odd. It smells like water that has been kept in a bottle for too long. Uncomfortable is, that the bedding is humid. When I was lying in my bed, it felt like the staff had forgotten to tumbledry the sheets. I have complained about it by housekeeping. Although they paid attention to it and renewed the bedding, the next evening I had the same problem. It would be a good suggestion the staff dried the rooms if it is dry season in Delhi or check the airconditioningsystem. Normaly with airconditioning the complaint is that the air is to dry instead of too wet.Marcel Braakman, The Netherlands "
ashok country resort ,"Nice hotel Stayed here for one night only as it's convenient fot the airport and we were flying home next day. No complaints - helpful staff, comfortable room and good food. The gardens are lovely and there's a decent pool. The man on reception rang through to an Indian friend's mobile for us and refused to accept money for the call. These little things help. "
ashok country resort ,"Overpriced Fairly decent 3 star airport hotel. Seemed filled with tour groups. Rooms were good sized but had a distinctly mildew smell you noticed the second inside the door. Our room certainly could do with some fixing up and it looks like maintenance is not high on the hotel’s list of priorities.Wouldn’t want to spend too many days at this hotel but for a transit airport hotel it does the job and would fill the niche of a 3 star airport hotel if only they would lower the room price by about a third. And on that note, they also tried to overcharge us for the room until we showed them their email including the price. "
ashok country resort ,"No real complaints Stayed here twice for one night in different rooms during a tour with Kuoni. Overall the hotel is quite acceptable for a short stay, and it's only approx 20 minutes from the airport. The rooms were fairly well appointed for a 'medium' class hotel, the AC worked well, though the beds were very firm (we later found out that this is normal in Indian hotels). The restaurant served a buffet in the evening but there is a separate menu that the staff maybe weren't keen for us to see but is there if you ask for it. Thought the buffet was OK think it cost about 650 rp (approx £9) per head but you could eat as much as you liked and was a three course affair. On our second night my partner had 'Delhi belly' though the rest of us seemed OK. We think it could've been either the trifle or the custard served as one of the desserts. There's also a pool in the well maintained gardens if you need to chill. I think the other reviews I've read seem a little harsh and may be due to particular gripes but we didn't have any (apart from the 'Delhi belly' which affected at least some of the group at the various hotels we stayed at) so we feel it deserves a little more positive feedback. Would stay there again but only thing to bear in mind is that it's an hour by taxi to central Delhi but if, like us, your on a tour with prebooked hotels on you itinerary, then there isn't much you can do about that. "
ashok country resort ,Not up to mark I selected this hotel because it was close to the airport and also price point is good. However the level of services is not up to mark. There is no in room internet access. The gym is ok but opens late at 8am only. All else is ok. Not a suitable hotel for long business trips. 
ashok country resort ,"Disappointing I stayed for one day, and was thoroughly disappointed with what I got. The food in the restaurant was tasteless, the refrigerator in the room not working, room service willing, but incapable due to lack of experience. The surcharge on long distance calls as charged by them could not be justified on any account. Disappointing, to say the least. "
ashok country resort ,"Worst hotel we stayed in This is one of the worst hotels we stayed at during our time in India. The check-in and restaurant staff were rude, the restaurant was very poor, the carpets were stained, the rooms smelt, the sink was broken, bathroom dirty, the price was expensive compared with other hotels. Even for a quick overnight stay, it spoilt what was a superb time in India. We could not escpae since it is remote. Value for money was also poor since it was not even cheap.For a Gov. run hotel, it needs to get its act together. "

ashok hotel ,"Fine business hotel -- not fully luxurious but well above average I was put up here by a Government of India agency I was visiting. The hotel is owned by GOI, I believe, and so they get preferential rates. It was of the caliber of a nice Marriott -- clean, spacious (I was in the &quot;annex&quot; wing), relatively modern. Not glitzy (I'd stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi 10 days earlier -- that was about as glitzy luxurious as I've ever been). Service was professional but not obsequious, not overly solicitous. If I'd paid myself, I might have been disappointed, but compared to other &quot;business&quot; hotels I stayed at in India, this was fine. (I'm from the US, have traveled extensively in developing countries.) "
ashok hotel ,"Old glory that has disappeared for ever I stayed at The Ashok for 4 nights at a business trip in the beginning of November 2009. What a disappointment. Old glory has gone and it will take a multimillion investment to ever get this back. The state of the hotel is miserable, the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby. The room was middle sized and looked rather Ok, but there is a big cleaning problem here. The floor was really dirty, no way to walk bare foot here. Free wireless internet was available and it worked well, but every 24 hours you had to return to the reception desk (very long walk!) to get a new voucher. There is a problem with staff in general and the front desk staff in particular. They are not interested at all to give any service to their guests. Their only interest seems to be to get tipped! As an example, I was informed two times wrongly about meeting places because the staff just didn’t care to look it up properly, which resulted in two times a 10 minutes’ walk to the wrong place.The Ashok is a very big hotel in the diplomatic area of Delhi, so the surroundings are nice. This is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel. Next time I definitively will look for another place to stay in Delhi. "
ashok hotel ,"Definetelly not a 5 star hotel I stayed in Ashok for 2 nights during a conference. The booking has been made by the organisers of the conference so I had no choice. Before visiting the hotel I read the reports n the tripadvisor and I was terrified!Upon arrival I had some positive feelings because the lobby areas is really fine and the service I received in the front desk very good. Upon entry in my room the disappointment started. The big problem with the hotel has to do with the cleanliness. The hotel and particularly the rooms are dirty. The space of the rooms is fine, the furnitures really old (but OK) but you can see everywhere that there is no proper cleaning. I tried the room service and although efficient (it took about 20 minutes) the food was of a fast food quality.Staff was friendly and the wireless internet fast enough and free. In no case this is a 5 stars hotel, but it is not terrible. "
ashok hotel ,"Good loaction average service I stayed in Ashok last month with my family for a brief holiday. The location is quite good almost midway between the city center and the airport. The staff was courteous but a bit lazy, rooms were good but seemed a bit old as far as the upholstery is concerned. The bathrooms do need a lot of improvement and this was one negative factor of the place. The food was average and we preferred eating outside in the private restaurants situated within the building. The pricing was definitely on the higher side as compared to the services offered.The place is undergoing some massive renovation and i expect to have a better experience the next time I am in Delhi. "
ashok hotel ,"Cheapest Five star in delhi..expansive but moderate service Great expansive property in one of the best areas in Delhi.Right in the heart of diplomatic enclave, this hotel has seen its better days.Still, it is trying to modernize post privaitization and addition of Fbar and the host of events it hosts is propelling it forward.Price is normally around 8k INR which makes it one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest in Delhi.Always full of foreigners (mainly backpackers or organized trippers), Indian bureaucrats and Indian airlines crew, this is a nice value for money hotel.During one stay, i got a refurbished room which was a huge improvement over the previous ones. In room dining can easily be accomplished for 400/500 per person a steal.Sagar ratna is a recommended restaurent. The pool isnt heated and the staff are servile and still retain the sycophantic outlook always on the lookout for tips.in all stay if you want a five star at the cheapest rate in the best part of delhi.

ashok hotel ,"Subject of an Emperor As an invited participant of an' International Stakeholders' consultation,I was accommodated in 'The Ashok',Chanakyapuri,New Delhi. An aristocratic name in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city raised our expectations to perhaps somewhat unreasonable limits.There were major problems with the attitude and approach of the staff which started considering you as subjects of the royalty(a subject /Praja of Maharaja/Emperor Ashok) the moment they realized that for the 'second class guests' everything is on the house/to be paid by the organizers.Even an offer to utilize the services against a payment was looked in a dubious manner with not so polite insistence on submission of all the details of credit card etc.I am sorry but even after a passage of more than 3 years I do not remeber a moment after the seesions which I enjoyed there though it could have been very easily done.I still cherish the time spent at Hotel Japhu,Kohima,Nagaland,Taj,Chikmaglur,Hotel Oberoi,Calcutta,Holiday Inn,Genva,Hotel Kigali,Rwanda and Taj Colombo Sri Lanks etc. mainly beacuse of the welcoming and accomodating attitude of the respective staff.

ashok hotel ,Very good property no value for money The ashoka hotel is one of the grandest hotels in India built by the govrnment. The hotel has exceptional facilties - the gym and swimming pool is very good. The price is very high though for the qulity of service and good. The service is more govrnmentish with people wanting tips for even small work. The gym is one of the best in India and attracts the political class and sportsmen. The food is good and has signficant variety. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend a short time in New Delhi and needs access to central delhi 
ashok hotel ,lousy place at a very high price This is a very lousy place with nothing great about it and comes with a very high tariff rates. Everything is very costly and rooms are not well maintained. the only exception is the its Restaurant Frontier which serves good food. 
ashok hotel ,"=not as horrible as expected I stayed at the Ashok this past week and was quite relieved that it was not as horrible as the other reviews indicate. My room did not seem dirty, and housekeeping came daily - i left a tip each day, so maybe that helped. Bugs: i did see a small roach in my room on night one, he was dead by morning from insecticide poisoning. Previous reviewers complained about a bad smell in the hall- it's clearly insecticide, i take it roaches are hard to eradicate in that part of the world. It was kind of gross to find the coverlet on my bed smelled of bug spray, but what can you do, better that than more roaches. It IS a third world country, after all...i think the problem is that they are charging first world prices. If my workplace hadn't paid, maybe i would have been more upset with the shortcomings. I def. wouldn't stay there if i was paying!the staff: here i will agree. they were rude and impatient when i repeated things back to them to verify information about how to get a cab, or where to store my luggage in the interval between check out time and the end of my conference. did not appreciate the attitude. i am a woman traveling alone, maybe you could be a little patient that i want to be sure i have the information right? and yes, housekeeping are big tip seekers....despite leaving a tip when i left in the morning, they would ring my doorbell at 8-9 at night to &quot;see if i needed anything&quot; I woud ignore the doorbell and then at least once they called on the phone! go away! they hang out in the hallway and pounce when you come back to inform you that they changed the fruit in your room or whatever,. looking for a tip. Also i was supposed to have free breakfast in the coffee shop included in my room tarrif. Most days i didn't bother. My last night there i got ill and tried to exchange my breakfast ticket for two cans of sprite the next morning, to soothe my stomach. they wouldn't do it. wanted me to pay. I tried to reason with them that whatever food i would eat if i came for breakfast would cost more than the sprite. i wanted two cans of sprite for breakfast, right? they had me sit down, talked amongst themselves, offered me canned juice. Juice made me sick in the first place. They wouldn't budge. This completely pissed me off. that is one star customer relations. WTF? He tried to tell me the relative expense of the items wasn't the issue blah blah blah but i lost patience to hear his explanation and stalked out. They just wanted more money. Like every freakin' Indian i encountered in Delhi, unfortunately. hang on to your purse because people will be trying to sell you things/cheat you at every turn! "
ashok hotel ,"over priced - under whelmed - ashock ing hotel shabby, smelly , tired, and that was just the staff. Poorly trained they did not have a clue. The fixtures and fittings were poor, the views awful and generally just disappointing. Our deluxe room had a comfortable bed and that was about it. One scruufy towel each, a grubby bathroom and no sign of any love or care.Of the six restaurants in the hotel only two were open and one of them was just vile. The other was average but top prices.Our 3 1/2 night stay cost £700 - do not stay here.This was billed as a five star hotel with matching prices - I suggest they invest in some lessons from the Taj Group - felt completely ripped off and we were both very ill into the bargain. hope it loses down - would like my money back!

ashok hotel ,"sad... Was my 4th stay at the hotel since 2000 and sorry to state that it's not getting better. Staying there as it's the place of the conference I am attending so it's just to avoid taking taxis on several occasions per day.... Had booked and confirmed room with balcony though received room without. When referring back to the reception's staff (be aware of the cashiers, as greedy as the years before) was informed, that the rate is the same... It's by far overpriced and one has to greet the staff, it's not the staff greeting you.... Meals at coffee-shop are &quot;OK&quot; while the staff at coffee-shop is at least trying to be friendly and fast.... trying...

ashok hotel ,"What a view! I and my wife were travelling to Delhi for romantic getaway. We wanted to experience some really good places &amp; things together.We wanted to spend time in some good hotel so we could remember the stay as well as the places of stay. We had heard a lot about Hotel Ashok, how magnificient it is and how marvelous the view from the hotel top looks.We called up and booked a reservation for us. When we visited the hotel, we were impressed by how huge it looks from outside and how well it was maintained. The reception was quite good. The wait at the checkin was not at all there and within few minutes we were escorted to our room by a bellboy.The room was spectacular. It was well furnished and even the bathroom had marble tiled floor and huge mirrors. The room was spacious and had a very huge balcony. The Balcony was overlooking some gardens and playgrounds. THE VIEW FROM THE BALCONY WAS AWESOME. It gave us a very open view of the outside, yet private from others. We loved it.The restaurant in the basement was quite good. They have different types of restaurant serving different kinds of cuisines. We tried few of them and they were quite good food.Coming to the cons: As known before, the hotel is slightly on an expensive note. It is not easy to use it as a regular getaway. We had our own transportation for most of the time and hence distance wasn't the matter but on a few occasion, getting public transportation was not easy. However the hotel do have lot of Auto and Taxi guys waiting around and the doorman can help to get one for you.Overall, it is a great place and we really enjoyed it. "
ashok hotel ,"loved the ambience I heard a great deal of bad reviews before we left. The Ashok is a government owned hotel and hence does not have the massive private investment of the other in the diplomatic enclave. I was greeted in a friendly manner when I arrived (4am, can't say I'm to impressed with Delhi Airport), staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. I am on the 3rd floor in a really nice room, I have two beds to myself, my room is cleaned and stocked daily. Everywhere I go I am saluted or bowed to, the decor is good, the place is clean. A few things to watch for: A few of the plug sockets have issues but for RS70 you can get a pretty good plug adaptor, the food in the 'Coffee Shop' is good enough, nothing special and the Paprika Chicken is awful, don't try the chinese restaurant, we ordered 3 plates of food and some rice and each dish got steadily worse, the first was what looks like a plate of ears (Chicken), the second looked like a pile of rotting cat poo (Beef) and the third looked like a collection of arteries and viens (Lamb) - absolutley disgusting! The rice wasn't bad though. Stay away from most of the food, check out the 'Fusion' bar, the staff are great and really freindly. I would definatley come here again. "
ashok hotel ,"don't ever think about it! OMG! I don't know what kind of star it has, definitely it's not shining!!! My husband and I went there for a medical convention.we arrived late evening, checked-in and went straight to our room. voila! smelly,bedcovers are dirty, yellow stained pillow cases,,creeking wavy faux wood flooring and bathroom was filthy! thanks heaven we brought our rubber slippers! you can't walk inside without it! haay, the next morning we went to the convention and came to the hotel room late...Surprise! room was smelled up with tobacco! i was angry but my husband told me to keep my cool. the next day, we let the cleaning man tidy up our room, my husband was in the shower and me reading seated behind a desk. peeking once in a while to see if the man is doing his cleaning job properly. satisfied, we gave him a big tip and closed the door. my husband went ahead to the convention and left me. while i was in the shower, someone rang the doorbell, thought it was my husband and might forget something, i ran to the door since it has no observation hole, asked loud &quot; sweetheart, is that you?&quot;. then that someone spoked indian that i dont understand and i said &quot;later&quot;!! with emphasis! after a shower, i put on my clothes and was taking my time putting on my make-up, somebody rang the door again. the cleaning man gave me a basket of fruits and a bottle of coke and i said thank you and closed the door. rang the door again, it was a man wearing black suit and said that my laundry will be delivered that same day, i said thanks and closed the door. after i made myself up, i headed to the door to go out but suddenly the phone rang, thought it was my husband, i picked it up and said &quot;hello? sweetheart? helloo, hello? but the other line was just listening to my voice and all of a sudden i heard this voice of a woman moaning and in indian language! lewd! i placed the receiver down in a hurry and frozed, wondering what was it? who was it? after several seconds the phone rang again, i let it rang 3 times, i answered it again with firm and loud voice &quot; dad, is that you? hello,who is this?!! hello,hello?!! same thing happened again! i banged the phone, trembling,terrified. ran out the door and asked the cleaners who was the prank caller that made the lewd calls. i dont know if they understand me! my gosh! this is supposedly a five star hotel in their country! is it?!!! or never? after i complained, i noticed that there are more securities all over the hotel! holy cow! we've been around the world and never encountered such a thing! we will never go back to that place again! before that thing happened, the staffs look at you creepily as if they haven't seen a woman before! and outside of that hotel as well! creeeepy!!! rating? BLACK STAR! "
ashok hotel ,"Smelly This place is awful. Our convention was held here, and so, in order to avoid the hassle of getting a trustworthy driver every day, we decided to stay here despite the negative reviews. Hotel staff were a little creepy. Our hallway smelled very bad (especially in the mornings). Luckily, most of the smell remained in the hall and did not come into our room. That's not to say that our room didn't smell, it was just better in comparison. It was impossible to get internet in your room, so you needed to go down to the main lobby to get any work done. And since only one of the electrical outlets in the lobby seemed to be working, you had to make sure your computer was well charged before coming downstairs.I did see one roach in the hallway, (luckily again, not in our room). Stains, of course, on the towels/shower curtains. Our friends from Kenya were met with unacceptable racism from the hotel's club. I can't possibly say enough bad things about this hotel. Stay somewhere else! "
ashok hotel ,"In my 6 weeks in India this was the worst In the 6 weeks and 15 cities I've been to in India, this was the worst of the worst (and I stayed here more than once!). The staff was the rudest I've encountered anywhere, the room was dirty, the location was far from anything, and it was of course overpriced. I highly recommend against staying here. "
ashok hotel ,"!!! AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH !!! We have never stayed in such a filthy, crumbling, insect ridden, mold covered, noisy, smelly establishment in my life - and wouldn't wish anyone else to!! Had we wished to experience such a place, we would have booked into a B&amp;B in the bazaar. On second thoughts, that would probably have been a nicer place to stay!!!The windows didn't fit properly so you had the noise and the smell of the traffic. We slept on top of the covers because of the state of the bed linen and would not walk on the carpets in bare feet. As for the bathroom - we washed in the sink rather than use the shower/bath.Doors to service areas/laundry were left open and you could see and smell the mold growing on the walls. Quite nauseating - it just made our skin itch!!One night was one night too much but as we'd arrived at 10pm, we didn't have the energy to look elsewhere!For a government run hotel, it was an absolute disgrace. The place ought to be knocked down as it is a health hazard. Even if this was the only starred hotel left in New Delhi, we would not stay here again. We would take the B&amp;B in the bazaar any day of the week!! "
ashok hotel ,"Value for Money Room rates in Delhi are surely overpriced as there is such a dearth of world-class hotel accommodation. In such a scenario, the Ashoka Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced 5-star accommodation available as it is still government owned.The acommodation is good and the service even better. Though many years old, the hotel has good rooms that are well appointed and reasonably big. Will surely use this hotel again. "
ashok hotel ,"Stay away !! I would advise you to stay away from this hotel. I found that my hair dryer would not work, nor my television, not the desk light nor the floor light, and some of the electrical sockets. As I discovered them, most of these necessitated a visit from staff - at first I tipped those who fixed them, but then decided maybe this was a racket to get more tips. I was also suspicious about the fact that they only turned down the beds and left in fresh water AFTER I had gone to my room in the evening, no matter how late I returned - and waited around for a tip. They stopped turning down the bed after two days when i left them tipless for this. The shower curtains were stained, as was the armchair - and i found dirty slippers with lots of dust under my bed. When my message light showed, I discovered that the message key did not work, the first person I asked to help me on this never came back to me on it. Eventually i found another staff person who managed to get my messages, through an unknown code which he did not give to me - there were no instructions on how to access these messages anywhere in the room. The food (which tasted quite good, or at least the indian style food) was very expensive - more than the price for a similar meal back in the U.S. Service however was terrible - we waited 15/20 mins for some water to be brought to us. The use of wireless access cost $25 a day. The cost per night for this hotel is outrageous for a Delhi hotel - $250 a day - best go elsewhere. "
ashok hotel ,"Dirty buggy and ridiculously overpriced My husband and I stayed here for a conference at the end of February. It's a dump. Our room hadn't been vacuumed in ages, there was hair everywhere and orange pits on the bathroom floor, and our room (and a colleague's) had cockroaches. We're seasoned travelers and have stayed in dodgy places before, but for $250/night (the conference rate), we expected to at least be able to walk barefoot from shower to suitcase without accumulating someone else's hair and food on our feet. I don't know what the cleaning staff does there, besides barge into your room to deliver unnecessary and unrequested items (matches, extra bottles of water when you already have three) in the hope of getting a tip. In addition, the elevators shorted out on us a couple of times, and our electronic door-key receiver thing took three or four tries to unlock. The (consistently rude) hotel staff gave me the key to someone else's room and then acted like I'd done something sneaky to get it, and they lectured my husband on the proper insertion of the key card when he tried to get a replacement for his non-functional key. Conference meals were held in a courtyard area with thin carpeting laid over a mystery substrate that was apparently full of rocks. I saw many conference-goers trip and spill their food. (No great loss, as the food sucked, but dangerous all the same.)To top it all off, the lobby is full of carpet and trinket shops, so if you haven't already grown sick of hearing &quot;madam, take a glance, no need to buy, just look,&quot; then you're sure to get your fill on your way to the elevators.Try hard to stay away from the Ashok. "
ashok hotel ,"May be OK one day Hayes &amp; Jarvis &quot;upgraded&quot; us to the Ashok from the Oberoi Maidens for the first 3 nights of our India tour. We read the reviews and hoped it would not be as bad as reported, but unfortunately it was. Our rooms were dirty, especially the bathrooms which looked as thougth they had not been cleaned properly for years. You could hardly see in the mirror and the last guest's rubbish was still in the bins. It was very difficult to get rid of our creepy room &quot;boy&quot; who seemed to appear for no apparent reason every time we went to our rooms. My mother, particularly, was rather unnerved as she was sleeping alone and dreaded him just walking in - in the end she had to be quite rude to him, which is not her nature at all, and after that we hardly saw him, which was quite a relief. The restaurant was OK but a long walk along a miserable corridor from the main part of the hotel. We were not keen on the buffet dinner but the a la carte meals we had were acceptable and not bad value for money. The good news is that they do seem to be in the process of refurbishing the hotel and the new parts, like the &quot;Island&quot; restaurant and the business centre are very nice. I think it will one day be restored to its former glory but they also need to train the staff to do something other than look for tips. "
ashok hotel ,"A Shoker! Delhi is suffering from an accute hotel room shortage. The result is the Ashok at USD400 a night for an ordinary hotel room, ordinary tired property with ordinary to below average service. The room is clean, the bed comfortable and the water hot but for USD400 you want a little bang for your buck.The fridge was faulty. TV reception unwatchable despite three visits by repairman. Mod cons like the &quot;wireless&quot; internet served up a strength that redlined at least once a minute making transfers of longer documents virtually impossible (again technicians could not help). Request for ice through room service (no machine or alternative available on the executive floor) was accompanied by high expectations for a tip and on one occassion unannounced entry when I left the door ajar accidently (ie did not knock before entering).Seriously, there are some great hotels in Delhi (I like The Park) - The Ashok is not one of them "
ashok hotel ,"Stay clear of the Ashok Overrpiced - London prices for poor quality rooms and miserable service. The lowest point was when the waiter in the lobby lounge wiped the tea cups with his finger, and later washed our cups behind the desk with water from a mineral water bottle, from which he was also drinking. The same waiter also had poured us two cups of tea, then whisked the teapot away to finish the rest of the tea with his colleague. Do not stay there! "
ashok hotel ,"They issued the room to another guest 1 hr after I checked in! I was shocked that someone opened my door after midnight and we found out that the hotel issued the same room to another guest! I think that was an inexcusable error, what kind of security is that?I booked for a Superior Room but was given a Standard Room instead. The room is qutie recently renovated. The bathroom has no bathtub so the floor is wet after shower. There is not enough space to place toiletries too. The sound proofing is not good. I could hear TV noises from other rooms and the staff can be loud when they go around their duties along the corridor.The breakfast buffet was ok, your best bet is Indian food. The masala dosa was good. But no dosa on Sunday.The best part of the hotel is its gym. Modern equipment with individual TV screen. The staff seemed to be more friendly towards the regular clum members though. "
ashok hotel ,"The good and the bad OK, good things first: The hotel has a an awesome architecture and presents the atmosphere of the historical New Delhi. The reception hall and the sheer size of the hotel is impressive.The service is friendly and the restaurants are of good quality. The fitness and SPA area is really first class: Latest equipment and qualified trainers.For the rooms the experience is different: I stayed in the 6th floor, my room was obviously renovated and had parquet floor and relatively new furniture. The cleanliness and hygiene however was beyond any acceptable standard and would not be accepted even in a roadside motel: The bed was dirty and old curly hair from previous guests still present on the linen ....eerrgg ! The toilet was bearing week old traces of dried detergent fluid and the seat was spotted with different brownish colors. The shower handle just fell from its bearing upon touching and clear water only came after several liters of rusty brown water went down the drain. Obviously no room checks were made before renting it out to the next guest. On the following day the bed clothes were replaced,so no hair anymore, but then the linen had black greasy spots on it with doubtful origins. So I used towels as bedsheets. To sum up: for a five star hotel unacceptable and overpriced. Hygiene and cleanliness were kill factors, I do not accept this at 1 or 2 star hotels, not to speak of a five star ! As I said in the beginning the hotel has a good potential and facilities are worth five stars. If the management can cope with the housekeeping issues it will certainly get better ratings. For me however, it was the last time that I stayed there. For this room rates you get other five star hotels in Delhi. "
ashok hotel ,"Lovely Hotel I'm glad I didn't read these reviews beforehand. My husband and I stayed at the Ashok Hotel last weekend and we had a lovely time. We did not have reservations and when we inquired about rooms, the receptionist upgraded us to the executive floor at regular rates. The room was clean with a view of the pool. The bed was soft and comfortable, the room included many amenities and there was plasma tv. All the staff were accomadating and friendly. The food and drink at the restaurants were great and the pool and spa were beautiful. The executive lounge was nice and convenient (breakfast was served just down the hall from us on the 6th floor). We are from Canada and I was not expecting to stay at such a nice place. It is an old hotel, but that adds to the charm. It was beyond my expectations. The only reason I did not rate it above average was because of the price. It was expensive, but a weekend in Delhi to see the Taj Mahal was worth it. "
ashok hotel ,"Krishna the porter We had a terrible shock at the Ashoka Hotel! When we actually arrived in our room we found that there was a complimentary fruit basket which was mouldy and as old as or maybe older than the hotel....There were fake bottles of water...that were supposed to be mineral water but had been filled up with local tap water, we figured this out from our stomachs that night and this was very unpleasent. As for the plumbing, the toilets were over flooding and lets just say what went down came straight back up! ....Now for the service...the porters were constantly knocking at the door...waiting for tips and asking silly questions.....me and my sister thought we had accidently checked into fawlty towers (then again if we had we would have been some what lucky to an extent). One night the porter followed us in our room, we thought it was a service to be dropped to the room but when he came inside withouth an invite we were shocked! He told us he didnt drink alcohol and yet he managed to swig down half a bottle of bacardi! He kept inviting us to go and eat with him and his family, more fool us, we didnt actually realise we were invited to foot the bill and tip the resteraunt! The cheeek of it! They also refused to take credit card payments and would only accept cash! The only thing they would keep saying to us is &quot;ma'am! As polite as they were sounding it was very difficult to communicate!!....We could go on forever with the stories of how we survived for 7 nights but save urselfs from the misery! Also being Indian me and my sister felt discriminated against as there were rules for people!...Our final trip was to the Taj Mahal...we went for a day trip and as there were a few more spaces in our private transport the hotel staff invited themselves to come....and they robbed money and cheated my elderly father! Be warned of these people and their hotel! "
ashok hotel ,"Okay in our section but not 5 stars We stayed at the Hotel Ashok, 50B Chanakyapuri, as part of a group tour making a brief stop in Delhi. It is a huge hotel with a number of restaurants and a shopping arcade and a fancy business center. It is in New Delhi south of the government area, with no neighborhoodto walk to, and no nearby subway. Would not have been particularly convenient if we had time for our own outings, but we did not. Our room in what must be the renovated wing (far to the right as you facethe front of the hotel) was fine, but rooms in the other wing did not sound that great. We did not find it to be nearly as bad as the pans on Tripadvisor.com, and we found the service to be fine, but it definitely does not deserve its apparent 5 stars or justify the price(apparently $200+). "
ashok hotel ,"Trust these reviews - honest! As a government owned hotel the service is about as bad as it gets. Hotel restaurants are pretty poor as well - I had to send back under cooked chicken, and the fish got its revenge during the night :-(Was probably a great hotel 30 years ago but now rooms are shabby and run down. Do yourself a favour and stay away. "
ashok hotel ,"Very very disappointing Do youself a favor and trust all the negative comments about this hotel. It's definitely not value for money nor what is expected of it's &quot;star&quot; rating. I stayed two nights at the hotel and the first night was terrible. The room was muggy, sheets were dirty and the bed was not even flat! The telephone looked like it hadn't been wiped down in 25 years, seriously no joke. I demanded a room switch (which reception took forever to concede to) so the second night I stayed in the newly renovated ones (the older, crappier ones will be renovated on soon, but call ahead to see if it's done bc it might take some time), and they were better, BUT my sheets had hair on it and the bathroom was not very clean. Rates for the renovated rooms and the old, crappy ones are the same.If you have no choice but to stay here, make sure you get the hotel to assign the new rooms to you. That said, be prepared for reception to tell you the day that you arrive that those rooms are all taken and they give you one of the crap ones instead. "
ashok hotel ,"Sadly - Just about as bad as everyone says! I went to the Ashok hoping that the earlier reviewers were just fussy and demanding. Sadly they were simply accurate. An average 3 star hotel trying to be 5 star. The public areas are ok but the rooms are old, tired and dated. Service is patchy and the facilities (shops, restaurants etc) set in something of a time warp!I was able to put up with this and had to stay as a conference was being held at the venue. But others were paying $200 a night - sheer robbery.For a few days relaxation I transferred to the Intercontinental Nehru Place - new hotel different universe. Excellent in every way and the same price as the Ashok. I notice the management at the Ashok have not used the right of reply faciliity on this site. That tells its own story. Avoid unless you enjoy wasting money. "
ashok hotel ,"A very bad Shock worst hotel ever This was the worst supposedly 5* hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff were extremely rude, food was awful and the rooms were old and grubby. I so wish I had read the reviews before paying £400 for 2 nights. It was most definately an experience to forget. I wrote a letter of complaint to them and suprise suprise I've had no reply. I would recommend that no one should even consider this hotel, you are better off staying somewhere which is 2*We stayed in this hotel to get the best of our last 2 days in India and regretted every minute. It totally left a sour taste in our mouth, we were glad to get back to the UK. "
ashok hotel ,"Not quite as disturbing as others say it is ...but then again, it is definitely not a good hotel either. I found it to be basic, but ok. Then again, if you think of how much you pay there, it is quite a rip-off. In Europe, I would say, this hotel is ok if you pay not more than 80 EUR a night for a room. Sure, everything is a bit old there and some parts more run down than others, but that is because their furniture is often made from wood and uses carpets where more modern hotels go with more practical furbishing. However, staff was quite friendly, room service quick, and they have a nice outside pool and spa. Also the adjunct restaurants seemed to be alright. But like I said, everything there is just 'alright', which is not good enough for ca. 250 EUR a night. I would probably go there again if my work sent me there, but I would definitely not recommend this as a honeymoon location. It would be fairly disappointing. "
ashok hotel ,"Never Stay - Read This and see pictures you will know why Hotel Rooms were stinky. It was worst hotel I ever stayed in. I paid 180 $ (INR 8000) for 1 Night.Hotel reception was ok but Rooms are dead.I needed a hotel near US embassy so I unluckily chose this one. Embassy was walking distance. Room was so disgusting that I cant mention it ... I dont have words ... If I write something I am sure tripadvisor.com would bann me .. so I took pictures of the room. Which speak itself ... It's like no comments ... Just check it urself. Room BathRoom - Oh God it was like a 10000 people used public toilet. Dirty like anything, Have pictures of these as well.Regarding Breakfast - It starts at 7 AM, and I was very hungry at 6 AM so I landed at breakfast area at 7:15 AM, nothing was ready on the serving table. I ate some toasts etc by 7:30 AM , by the time I was done 7:55 AM, I saw they started putting lot of other new tasty stuff too. So dont go before 8 AM incase you want to enjoy everything.Never ever stay in this hotel. "
ashok hotel ,"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This hotel is definitely a place where you should not stay even if you had a gun pointed to your head. I did not have the privilege of booking into a hotel of choice as it’s peak season but I did check this website ahead of my trip here. The reviews should have been warning enough as did the candid travelers pictures posted and the PICTURES DO NOT LIE. This hotel classifies itself as a 5 star DELUXE hotel and it probably was, 50 years ago. The exterior looks charming because of the architecture, very colonial but Indian at the same time. However, the inside is a different story.Firstly, upon arrival at 10p.m., there wasn't any porter service and that is quite strange for a 5 star deluxe. Whilst the lobby is clean it looks dated. The LCD TV at the lobby showed nice standard rooms in the TOWER block. I guess the tower block have the newly refurbished or recently cleaned and fumigated rooms, as it appears a FAR CRY from the rooms that were assigned to us (there were 3 of us and all 3 rooms were of similar dismal condition which really defeated the need to ask for a change of room). The key to the room weight at least one pound as it was solid metal and HUGE (the red paint on the key had discolored in parts which tells you how old these are!). Enough to knock anyone out if you threw it at him or her. You need to put the key into the key-hole (turn in clockwise) and at the same time turn the doorknob anti-clockwise before the door opens. The carpets (in the corridor as well as in the room) look as if it had never been changed for the 5 decades since the hotel was built. So old that where it has thined, you can see beneath the carpets and the dust that accumulates there. Where the carpets are completely worn out, a patch of new carpet is fitted on top. There are stains everywhere. Even on the bed sheets. The pillows are hard probably compacted from the years of use!Everything in the bathroom that is metal has rusted. Cannot tell about the metal in the room since the lighting in the room is best suited for nocturnal animals. The toilet seat had a wrapper around it that says `Disinfected for your safety’ and I believe them! Just wondering why they did not disinfect the rest of the room. The flush to the toilet is unique and is a knob that protrudes out of the wall. After turning it round and twisting it, you actually need to use all of your strength to push it in before it flushes as the rust is quite advance. Underneath the dresser there are phone books that say 2006 but look like 100-year old manuscripts. The furniture I don’t even want to describe.If by now you still do not have second thoughts of changing your accommodation, be prepared for the live-in guests that come FREE with the rooms since one night here costs USD200+. Cockroaches. These creatures were everywhere (and in all 3 rooms that we had). They were in the cupboards, on the water bottles supplied, in the toilet and on the towels (so bring your own!). I did not see any on the bed but I would not discount it. I don’t want to know if I had anything else sharing the bed with me (shudder). One night at the Ashok was indeed an experience never to be repeated again. We checked out the next day! Luckily for us, we managed to get a room at another hotel. My advice: Trust the reviews! "
ashok hotel ,"Noisy My husband &amp; I were booked into the Ashok for many days by his company after another hotel in Delhi fell through. After changing rooms once (the first had twin beds &amp; a damp carpet reeking of insecticides) we wound up with what was probably one of the best rooms in the hotel. Newly renovated, it had laminate wood floors, brand-new bedding, and was generally bright &amp; cheery. HOWEVER, the majority of my husband's colleagues were not so lucky. Their rooms were generally grubby and threadbare. Several reported cockroaches in their rooms, one had bed-bugs, and several had rooms so dirty they had to have housekeeping scrub them twice (and these are generally not picky people). The hotel is also ridiculously noisy. NONE of us slept well because a series of megaphones for a taxi stand outside go on ALL NIGHT LONG broadcasting traffic instructions and call-ups for cabs. It was like trying to sleep in an auction house or an air-traffic controller's room. Sounds of honking outside, the airconditioning vents, and the pounding nightclub downstairs only compounded the problem. What's more, the hotel does stink: of must and exterminator's chemicals. The stench was so bad that before we switched rooms, my husband couldn't sleep because the smell kept him awake, and by the end of our stay, our clothes were saturated with it. Another travesty is the service. Except for the Coffee Shop staff and a smattering of housekeepers, the service ranged from indifferent to rude. When I went to the travel desk to arrange a half-day sightseeing tour, the man there ignored me for five minutes while he chatted on the phone, then told me dismissively, &quot;I'm a very busy man right now. I don't have any cars available. Come back some other time.&quot; When several of my husband's colleagues checked out, the reception staff tried to charge them a higher rate than had been contracted. It was simply outrageous. The Ashok has some great restaurants, an excellent spa, and bags of potential. But the government has got to stop pretending this is a five-star hotel. Probably, it should get out of the hotel business all together. In the hands of a private interest and with some SERIOUS renovations and overhauling the Ashok could live up to the delusions of grandeur currently pictured on its website. But right now, it's an out-of-the-way, run-down, noisy, unappealing, overpriced wreck of a place. "
ashok hotel ,"A shock at The Ashok As a frequent traveller to Dehli, without a doubt my preferred hotel is The Imperial, or, at the other end of the spectrum, The Park. However, given the lack of rooms in the city I was forced to stay at The Ashok for my last business trip. A SHOCK certainly sums it up! The government run hotel could be a splendid example of traditional Indian grandeur, as its website claims. Sadly, it is not. I checked in late at around 11pm and was greeted by surly receptionists who seemed more interested in getting an imprint of my credit card (for Rs.10,000 - not cheap) than anything else. I was shown to my room by a bellboy so insistent on carrying my one small bag, despite my resistence, that he actually tried grabbing it from me. When I did get to my room, I was mortified. Shabby implies chic nowadays, but this was just shabby. Dirty fingerprinted TV, light switches, toilet seat; tarnished mirrors; dirty cutlery laying around; and the piece de resistance - dark hairs on the pilled pillows and sheets of each of the twin beds. It took three phone calls and a visit by housekeeping to convince them that I didn't want the room, nor did I want to wait for sheets changing, I just wanted to move. The second room seemed more promising, with a fruit basket (and clean knife) but on closer inspection, the beds again were hairy and unappealling. I slept with a pashmina as a pillow and had a terrible night's sleep, especially as after midnight housekeeping called to see if the room was okay; on advising them no, but I cut my losses, they didn't seem to know how to handle it other than saying that the general manager would make it up to me in the morning. Didn't hang around to see what that may involve, but suffice to say, if you have any other choice, don't stay here. What has the potential to be a wonderfully equipped five-star hotel with spacious rooms and a warren of shops and restaurants turned out to be a disappointingly dirty stay in Delhi. "
ashok hotel ,"don't stay at this hotel in delhi accomodation is terrible. This has got to be the worst hotel ever. The rooms are old and run down. There is a stink in the hallway and staff are generally not very helpful. The only good things are the staff in the restaurant and the breakfast buffet. If you are staying in india, spend a bit more money and stay somewhere else. It cost us $220 a night which is a complete rip off. We were really looking forward to getting out of there. The sheets were dirty and we asked them to change it. Noticed the next day the sheets were the same but changed towards the end of the bed. They don't change your sheets everyday. The electricity cords are dodgy too. It is a gross place to stay and i would avoid it...maybe back in the 60's it was good but not now..sorry to stay but it is the truth..yuk! "
ashok hotel ,"Overpriced with poor service and grimy rooms! Lesson learned: Never stay at a government-run hotel. The Ashok is a tired, grimy, grubby hotel. The rooms are dirty and dated, the service is surly and unatentive. I couldn't beleive this hotel was given a 5-star rating....until I found out that it was government-run/owned....The Taj hotels (Taj Mahal and Taj Palace) are FAR more pleasant at around the same price. "
ashok hotel ,"I wish I had checked the reviews I can't believe how bad this hotel has gotten. I originally was here in the early 80s when it was one of the best hotels in Delhi. With the exception of cable TV, I don't think the rooms have been updated since then. The beds are uncomfortable, the hot water is almost non existent, the paint is peeling , the internet service is one of the worst I have had in India and to top it off the food is awful at best and expensive. The sad thing is I originally was excited to be able to stay here after so many years. Between the lousy food, the crappy rooms and the creepy guys (security &amp; maids) in the hallways - this is one hotel to avoid. "
ashok hotel ,"3* pretend to be 5* We where surprised arriving at 5* hotel, where we found grey towels and bed linen. All over the hotel were signs of government ownership - too much of staff, equipment out of order, etc. I expect for that price you can get much better deal. "
ashok hotel ,Shocking time at the Ashok I was staying at the Ashok hotel between the 11th and 16th of May 2006 for business reasons. During my stay I found the rooms to be unclean and unsafe! whilst moving the hairdryer I received an electric shock. I reported this to the duty manager and asked to speak with the general manager. I was informed that the general manager was in the hotel but was in a meeting and unable to see me! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. 
ashok hotel ,"Hotel to avoid The room was very large, the furniture was grubby and tatty. The bathroom smelled, the bath did not drain, the bidet did not work, the W.C. splashed your trousers when flushed. The mini bar was empty. The balcony was very dirty, paint peeling off wood work and no balcony furniture. The windows were cracked, putty coming away and dangerous to open.The staff were rude, dismissive and unhelpful. I was pushed by one member of staff. The dining room was small and the food below par. There was no bar available to residents (closed for functions). One could not obtain a drink without going into a restaurant.All this for 315$US per night B/B!! "

ashok hotel ,"Not a five star hotel Hotel Ashok is a big hotel in the diplomatic district of new delhi (that is not close to any tourist destination !). it has many restaurants and shops and the lobby is Ok, But Ashok hotel was nothing near being five star. I would rather call it something in between one and two star hotel. &quot;Cleanliness&quot; had no definition in that hotel : my bed sheet was dirty and stained. the minibar refrigirator didn't work and it was empty. The toilette mirror was rusty. I really didn't dare touch anything in that hotel as it seemd that it had not been cleaned for the past 20 years.Although I have to admit that there were two parts in this hotel and the other part seemed to be Ok.I stayed there in Feb. 2006 for 3 nights and I would not be back there ever again. "
ashok hotel ,Very disappointed with the rooms and the service We stayed at the Ashok for one night in February as our Tour Company (Compass Tours) told us that the Park hotel was not available due to President Bush's visit to India. We were sent to dirty rooms that seemed like they hadn't been cleaned for weeks. We spent our afternoon trying to get cleaner rooms rather than sight seeing. We finally got some rooms that were a little cleaner than the ones we first saw and ended up staying there. We had paid the same rate as the Park Hotel (we had stayed at the Park earlier in our tour)where the rooms were a 100% better than the Ashok. The management was neither friendly nor helpful. Try to avoid staying here at all cost. 
ashok hotel ,"Pleasantly surprising stay not as bad as expected We stayed at the Ashok in Feb 06 for 3 nights there was 2 adults, 2 teenangers and a toddler. We stayed in a suite on Floor 5, this was well sized and we had 2 single beds put in the spacious living room. It seemed that there are 2 types of rooms, standard and superior, the superior ones are accessed by marble lined floors, the standard is by carpet. On our floor was an attendant 24/7 who was very attentive. The room was good (uk 4 star std) the bathroom was not as good but adequate. The hotel overall is quite dated but in Delhi is probably quite modern. There is a lot of staff around, who we found very helpful particularly with our toddler. The restaurants are ok, but I would recommend eating out. One night we ate at the hotels Frontier restaurant, food was northern indian fare, very good but at western pricing, later in the week we ate out for the same quality at 1/4 the price. There is a health club which is actually not owned by the hotel, it has very good facilities but if you want to use the gym only, they make you use the basic outdoor changing rooms as opposed to the clubs impressive facilities. Overall we enjoyed our stay but you must try and get a superior room/suite, it is worth paying a bit more. "
ashok hotel ,Soviet-Era Luxury Indian Style What a dump. Stay at hotels such as Oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver first-class amenities and services on all fronts. 
ashok hotel ,"Business travelers Stay Away General: There is a big gap between terrible and okay but some problems. This property falls somewhere in the middle but closer to bad. Front desk: To small and unorganized to handle more then three guests at a time. Took 25 minutes with a reservation to check in even after I got to interact with the miserable woman working behind the counter. Interior: Carpeting in hallways threadbare and dirty.Room: International plug did not work, no internet cable as purported, and remote was non functional. So working or relaxing was more complicated then it should be. The scale is so big that if the hotel is not full it is almost depressing eating in a 300 person restaurant during the only hour you have with a business guest and you are the only two in the house. Restaurants: Lots of options lots of range in quality. Korean rest was good, Chinese was not so good, the breakfast place could not handle the volume even a small event on the property. The new bar Steel is the best option this place had it was freshly done with good staff that tried and a great relaxed scene. It was the only real haven there where I did not dislike my stay. Conclusion: I travel the world and this was part of a 10 day trip in India and I had much better results at other hotels so this is not about India or cultural differences. Everything in this hotel seemed to be old and tired and interactions with the staff were harder or more complicated than it needed to be. If you do anything other than sleep there as a business guest the frustration took more than it should out of you by the end of the day. It was an exercise in patience all day. "
ashok hotel ,"like al india needs a clean up the receptionists personel asked my wife how long we are going to stay like they were afraid that we dont have enough money to pay despite the fact that we were coming and go again at the same hotel for a 1 and 1/2 months the rest personel its ok. .the restaurants had a good service except the chinese restaurant which they warm the food for 2nd time before the serve it. Surely it needs a good clean up, change of mattresses, change of all carpets, painting and repairs in the wc....and one more thing....the people in the parking area have to stop shouting through loudspeakers in the middle of the night......all night long...i have changed 6 rooms in this hotel and the situation was more or less the same. the surrounding area is peaceful and clean i wish the same with the hotel "
ashok hotel ,"Prisoners in the West enjoy better facilities Well, maybe not, because i lack any experience to comment about prison facilities. But i had to wait 52 minutes in the lobby (along with wife, son and a cranky 8 month old daughter and four suitcases) before i could get someone to show me my room. And that was ony after i got into and was the winner of a &quot;shouting&quot; match with the staff. The corridors were dark and I came across some dubious looking people during my one day stay there. The bathroom was of 1940's vintage and the toiletry was very cheap. Room service took forever. The thing that rankled me the most was the could not care less attitude of the staff. They were very grumpy looking and mean and behaved more like they did not really want to be there and did not want you to be there either. I really felt like kicking their backsides. The only saving grace was the performance of the musicians in the restaurant. Needless, to say i left the next day for another hotel. "

atrium hotel and conferencing center ,"Not worth the money spend External appearance is great. The employees dress like professionals. But it is only in their dress and salutations! All employees accept great tips. But service is really poor. I stayed in one room. There was heavy construction noise very nearby. Also there was block in bathroom sewage. Reported the trouble. They changed me to another room. Room was clean. But again not so good bath room and toilet (for the amount they charge). In the bathroom ventilator of this new room there was bird's nest and the birds were making noises. Looking out of the 4th floor room window, the view is in to the yard of a small house. You can enjoy everything happening in that house. Internet connectivity from your room: They charge you almost 15% of your room rent for internet connection for a full day and the connection is very poor. You cannot do any serious work with their connection. I stayed only for two days even though I was in Delhi for more than five days. The third day early in the morning itself I moved to another better hotel. "
atrium hotel and conferencing center ,"Hotel wasn't bad but not in the best location We stummbled upon this hotel accidently, were originally stayed at Raj Hans down the road...but it was soooo disgusting we paid double to stay at the Atrium the next night...our last night in India. so after staying in the crappiest 5 star ever the nite before the Atrium was definetly an upgrade...but it felt empty . We got there late ..about 11pm and were going to check out at 9 that morning so they lowered the rate for us. The location of this hotel sucks, the area is unlit at night...desserted....so for a first time traveller it made me uneasy...it was basically in the middle developing hotels...construction surrounds it...I think they are trying to build a community of resorts. The room was small but nice, modern. We ordered room service, it wasnt bad. Room was clean but there was a door joining our room with another and we could hear the people next door clearly...the walls are paper thin. I dont think I would stay there again but it was nice enough....we never did see any other guests, "
atrium hotel and conferencing center ,"Terrible Hotel Terrible location We had the misfortune to be allocated to this hotel by a tour operator.We were told we would be staying in a four star hotel in Old Delhi. However it transpired that we were instead booked into this hotel which is 25k from Delhi in another town altogether, Faridabad, an unattractive industrial area.Our first impressions of the hotel were of a massive construction site spewing dust onto a building with peeling paint and dirty windows. The room was the worst we stayed in throughout our two week stay in India. It was dirty, the electrical sockets were not attached properly to the wall, the sheets were stained and had holes and for the first 24 hours we had no hot water. The construction site began at around six am and made noise which was loud enough to wake us through a closed window.The hotel is arranged into four atriums which are massive and deserted. It seemed that our tour group and handful of others were the only people staying in hotel which had a capacity for at least ten times that amount. The service was not remarkable but a little lax. A room service tray which was outside our room when we arrived had not been removed when we left nearly 48 hours later, despite various staff coming to our and the adjacent room during the period.It took between 40 and 90 minutes to get in and out of the centre of Delhi depending on traffic and therefore it was not a practical choice for sightseeing in the city.I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel. "
atrium hotel and conferencing center ,"Horrible intrusive service at the Atrium I had the misfortune to spend around 10 days at the Atrium hotel while travelling on business. Really it was quite disappointing from start to finish. I was given a room with a tiny window in a corner, facing out onto an active construction site that was active almost around the clock. Besides the noise, construction workers could look right into the room as soon as a the curtains were open which left me without natural light most of the time. When I got to the room the shower didn't work, and it took them ages to fix, the toilet seat was broken, there was hair on the bedsheets, the carpets in the room were filthy and other small details in the room, glasses etc, were just not clean. I was never offered a new room.The service ranged from being, in the best case, just very awkward, to in the worst case being extremely intrusive. In general it was always bad. After a very disappointing meal in the restaurant I pointed out that the bill was incorrect (in my favour). Two times I was assured that it was fine. Two hours later I was called up in my room by someone who refused to speak english but managed to communicate that I needed to sign my bill. After a while he said he would come to my room. It was almost midnight and I had already gone to bed so I said absolutely not. Minutes later, despite my refusal, the person knocked on the door, barged in and forced me to sign a new restaurant bill to correct the mistake made hours ago. The difference was just a few rupies.Laundry was returned at almost 11pm and was always incorrectly handled despite clear instructions.I can't believe this hotel manages to market itself as international standard accomodation as it is so far below what can reasonably be expected that it is just not worth it at any price. "
atrium hotel and conferencing center ,"Good hotel excellent service We stayed at the Atrium for three nights in April.The service from check-in to check-out was excellent; all staff were helpful and friendly.The entrance is grand, the communal areas are well decorated, and the rooms are comfortable. Power can be erratic at times, but this is to be expected in Delhi.You will need transport if staying at this hotel, as it is a little out of town.All in all a nice hotel, and I would stay here again.

avalon courtyard ,Amazing! what can i say... drive through the area it is situated in and you are thinking the worst.. but turn the corner and the Avalon comes out of nowhere! Fantastically designed hotel with great rooms and good food! Gym and pool is always a nice addition which the avalon certainly does not lack. Only one quarm i can think of and that was the shower door not fitting properly leading to a large puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Apart from that... Amazing. 
avalon courtyard ,"Claustrophobic and No-maza The approach road to Avalon appears unfriendly and dilapidated. I don't think you want to take a stroll around the hotel. Inside the courtyard the rooms are trendy and has a mini kitchenette. The long french windows lead into nothing ... err a completely covered space. No fun. We used the place to grab a night's sleep as we kept ourselves busy with NewDelhi during day times. The courtyard boasts of a heated indoor pool, but the heating system wasn't functioning during our stay. Breakfast spread is ok. "
avalon courtyard ,"Modern and pleasant but totally out of the way! The Avalon was a pleasure to walk into - bright and spacious reception with modern decor. Very clean and pleasant check in procedure. Lovely double room - almost a suite, very well equipped with TV, sofa, comfy bed with clean and fresh bedding. Staff were friendly and attentive when required.Downside is the location....we booked this through an agent and so did not realise the location otherwise would not have stayed here. If you want to wander into town (Delhi), this is the wrong place to stay. If you want to stay in a quieter hotel in a residential area then this might be for you. "
avalon courtyard ,"Awful Location dry (alcohol) hotel drivers with scams for money but lovely rooms. Fortunately, the only savior with this hotel is the rooms are completely fantastic. We arrived in the evening and found our room entirely lovely. However on the following morning we booked a car through the hotel, only to be scammed by the 'guide'. The staff are entirely lovely and the restaurant is decent. IF YOU DRINK THIS IS NOT YOUR HOTEL, as this district of dehli is completely dry. Also you must keep in mind that if you travel outside of this hotel you may need to pay a tax to get entry back into the district (your taxi will not pay this fee). It is also far from the sights and city center so be prepared to pay around 700Rs for 40m or 4 hours and then fees above if doing any sightseeing. We probably would NOT go back because of location and proximity to anything in Dehli worth seeing. "
avalon courtyard ,"Ultra modern clean and very friendly I stayed in one of the Residence suits which was lovely - spacious, well equipped with kitchen, large bathroom, sofa, TV and very comfortable bed.The staff were delightful, really friendly and helpful.The spa was very nice and all facilities were included in the room priceInternet was super fast but expensive at 500RS for 2 hoursBreakfast was also delicious.It took just 30 minutes to get from the hotel to the airport for my homebound flight so it was really convenient as an overnight stop. "
avalon courtyard ,"good hotel but far from center I move to this hotel as i booked at Raunak hotel but it was nightmare there. this hotel is far from center about 30 mins but it's about 20 mins to airport and about 15 mins to big shopping mall which i am happy over there. the residence room is nice as it's similar to service apartment. you got living area and kitchen counter with microwave and shower. but shower always leaking out from the shower door and i rang the staff since teh first day but never come to fix it. the water is all over the floor everytimes i had a shower but the overall of the room is good. the hotel lobby is nice with modern style. the staffs is ok but not really communicate among themself first. i was plan to go to lotus temple and reception guy call to chek that it's open or not. he said it's open on that day but when we went their it was close. also, when we already booked the taxi to go to the airport. 3 staffs keep asking did you book the taxi yet and they want to charge me for the taxi even my package in my guest profile said 'included 1 way trasfer to airport'. the room service food is nice there but the breakfast is quite abit limit in choices. the internet is expensive also. it's RS 250 per hour. we paid at 3,500RS per night and i stay for 4 nights which i'm quite happy with the overall. "
avalon courtyard ,Very nice Room Nice Hotel Awful Location Sutese were very nice. Very modern and well equipped. Terrible view from window of high canvas fence installed I am sure to hide the view of the quite awful neighbourhood outside.Restaurant was nice with very pleasant staff. Food was fine if somewhat limited in choice. The restaurant was unlicenced and there was no bar in the hotel.Swimming Pool (Indoor) was unfortunately so cold we were not brave enough to use it. Otherwise recreation area was very good. 
avalon courtyard ,"GReat Hotel This is a very nice, clean well serviced hotel. Location isn't great but for a nice room and attentive staff, it is fantastic. The gym is great, on staff massages available. The food is fine--and they staff will attempt to make anything for you. the internet is really good, although expensive.A great find. "
avalon courtyard ,"Pub with no beer! We arrived at the Avalon Courtyard after flying in from Australia.We travelled along rutted filthy streets in the rain so our first impression of India was not so good.The driver pulled into a lane way and said here we are, we couldn't see a hotel!Once inside a huge and atractive atruim apeared, it was very nice, our room was lovely, very big with kitchenette, living area and bedroom with well appointed bathroom, a good suprise.The restaurant served excellent food, only one drawback.....it is a dry hotel, no bar, no liquor served at all and it is in the midle of nowhere so nowehere to go and buy any.For a group of Aussies arriving after 14 hours of travelleing that was not a good thing.Other than the location and lack of beverage it is a very good value hotel that I would hapily recomend, just BYO! "
avalon courtyard ,"Easy entry to India Very clean, modern and reasonably quiet. Breakfast was served early for us as we were on an early train to Agra. "
avalon courtyard ,"Ultra modern noisy and charmless. My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of our recent holiday.The Avalon Courtyard is ultra modern and totally lacking in any of the character and charm we experienced during our stays at all the other wonderful heritage hotels and palaces throughout our trip. To say my girlfriend hated it would not be an over statement.When you enter it, you feel like you are walking onto the set of some science fiction movie. All the rooms open out onto corriders which overlook a central courtyard/atrium.There is one cafe style restaurant from which you could sit and watch people in the indoor pool if anyone used it. The hotel at the time of our stay (9th March 2008) had no licence to sell alcohol.As mentioned by the earlier reviewer, it is not conveniently located for access to other bars and restaurants, so a taxi would be necessary should you wish to do so. When we asked why this hotel was chosen for our last night, the reason given was its proximity to the airport.The room was very modern and clean although quite small. There was no bath. The walls must be incredibly thin as I counted next door's alarm going off 5 times as the occupant made maximum use of the snooze facility. The windows are single glazed and serve only to keep the rain out, since they are more or less ineffective at keeping out Delhi's noise. The view from our room was of a concrete wall separated from us by only 20 feet or so.On the positive side, the staff were extremely courteous and friendly. One even took the trouble to return my suitcase keys to me which I had accidently left in the room when we checked out!Overall, I would say if you can avoid staying here then do so. If not, then treat it as a stopover en-route to somewhere better. "
avalon courtyard ,"Nice rooms friendly helpful staff New property that had just opened this month. Rooms are spacious and well suited for a medium term stay. Microwave, couch and a small frig in each room. Beds are great. Very nice gym with new equipment. Drawbacks were a challenging location, nothing close by within walking distance so taxis required. Property faces village road with two ninety degree turns on the same block. Cars horns are used to warn motorist and pedestrians as they approach the corners. Staying towards the back of property is recommended. "
claremont hotel and convention centre ,"Spacious clean and good service Stayed at this hotel while on holiday in Delhi. Female traveller alone. This hotel was away from the centre of Delhi so make time to travel in and out. Rooms are spacious, modern. Service was prompt and the food was good.Pool area is a bit run down and not very well attended. As a single lady the attention at breakfast was a bit too much - lots of staring and people coming out of the kitchen to look too. Another downside was the lack of hot water in the afternoons; had to wait until 6pm each day. I all a good hotel where single females will feel okay. "
claremont hotel and convention centre ,"Good for our one night pre-flight stay We stayed at the Claremont because we were looking for a reasonably priced, clean comfortable hotel near the Delhi airport. Distance-wise, the hotel is not that far, however it took us 40 minutes to drive to the airport at 7:15am on a Monday morning. We had planned for at least that amount of time, so it wasn't a problem. The hotel also allowed for us to have 3 adults and 2 children in one room. When making the reservation it stated we'd have 2 beds. Our room had 1 King and 1 twin bed that was brought in, so it really only slept 3 comfortably. The room was clean apart from a few stains on the carpet. One bothersome thing regarding the room was that there was no deadbolt and no latch on the door. The only way to lock the door while inside the room was to use the key (an actual metal key) to turn the lock. Also, the safe in our room was not functioning, so we made certain not leave anything of value in the room when we went out to dinner. The front desk staff and restaurant staff were very friendly. The restaurant offered a dinner buffet or an a la carte menu. The menu offered Indian and Chinese options and we were happy with the variety of choices. Overall, this hotel served our purpose of having a clean room with a hot shower before our early morning flight. "

The rooms are clean and decent, but the &quot;hot&quot; water was only lukewarm when I took a shower at 3:00am. "
claremont hotel and convention centre ,"Horrible Place to Stay On the tail end of an otherwise wonderful trip to Rajastan India, we were booked into this property by Castle and King TourServices. On our first day we were welcomed into a severelysmoked out room (we had requested a non-smoking room). We were told we would be transferred. After around fifteen minutes,we contacted the front desk and were told &quot;All rooms sold out!!!We can transfer you in the morning&quot;. We then encounted a non flushing toilet and had to use the lobby facilities all evening. Noassistance to repair was available. My wife, after coming out of the shower, told me 'Stay away from the shower curtain, it has a lot of mold on it&quot;. So went our stay at the Claremont.We left for Khajarao in the AM with a promise that we would be upgraded to a much better room when we returned to Delhi. I thought seriously about transferring to another hotel, but the payments for all three nights we already surrendered to the Claremont.When we returned to Delhi we were surprised to be upgraded to the &quot;executive suites&quot;. The toilet worked and the shower curtain was fine. Unfortunately the room was right above the disco or club facility so for two nights we had to listen to the unusual bollywood disco sounds until midnight or closer to 1AM.Our general opinion of our tour all over India was great. The people, sights, sounds, and food made for a memorable trip. The only bad thing was the way it ended in Delhi. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!! "

clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Good location comfortable for business visitors Had been to Qutab for a business event. The hotel is pretty centrally located which makes it ideal for business travellers.The conference hall was huge and the staff was cooperative. They did make all arrangements as per our requirements. The lunch was arranged by the poolside. The rooms are very comfortable. The food is ok, not great. Overall good for business travellers and tourists travelling alone or couples. May not be attractive or value for money for families. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Two nights at The Qutab I normally stay at a different hotel in New Delhi, but chose to stay here as it was close to the location for my business meetings. Safe to say that I totally regretted my choice within 15 minutes of landing up.The reception staff at check-in was probably a trainee from one of the hotel management institutes - had absolutely no clue about my reservation, even though I had a print out of the reservation confirmation with me - took them about 15 minutes to sort that out. I was then led to my room on the 4th floor, via a very slow and temperamental elevator that stopped on every floor on the way for no apparent reason - as no one got in or got off - a pattern that was repeated for the two days that I was there.The room was spacious, and relatively clean. The TV was an old piece of junk that made strange crackling and hissing noises. The bathroom looked as if it had not been cleaned since 1982, with grime in the tiling and a couple if missing tiles.Luckily, I had no opportunity to sample the food, except for breakfast on the first morning. Going by the cold, congealed quality on offer, I'm fairly sure that the rest of the meals would have left a lot to be desired.The straw that broke the camel's back was the incident of the malfunctioning key-card. I got back fairly late from dinner on the second night, and my key-car would not work. I went down to the reception to get that fixed, and it took them - get this - about 45 minutes to get one that worked!An over-priced, worthless two night stay. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,Great Value Great Hotel So clean a hotel. Unbelievable breakfast buffet bar. Loved the omlet stations. Clean rooms. On a less crowded road. Entry &amp; Exit very good. Parking OK. But the staff stood me out while they went to the room and checked the minibar status how much to charge me while I was in a hurry to get to the airport 
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,not recommended i stayed in qutab hotel in march for a day.its purely not a business class hotel.building is old and very average in terms of rooms and services.cleanlyness is ok but not very good.moreover the surroundings makes it worse.there is a garbage dump near by.no gud market near by.bad locality.i would purely not recommend it. 
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"A very good 3-star hotel. That's right... 3 stars. This is not a 5 star hotel by any standard. There are true luxury hotels in Delhi and this is definitely not one of them. I would actually say that this is a good 3-star hotel - I think it's the best way to describe it.The place is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing. The building is old and tired, and so are the rooms. It looked like a weird block of flats that at some stage was converted into a hotel. The staff is friendly and professional, but sometimes a bit clumsy.The most annoying thing for me was the unreliable internet access. It kept dropping out and was terribly slow. It's terrible if you plan to do some work here... During meetings and presentations there were also repeated power outages, which was annoying as it kept cutting out power to the projector, which needed time to be reset.The breakfast was among the worst breakfasts I have had in a long time. The pastry looked, felt and tasted like it had been sitting there for a week. The choice of food was very limited too.The restaurant food (lunch and dinner) was otherwise ok. I had some food there, and also some room service, and it was fine. No complaints. I think the problem is just the breakfast.Would definitely not return here and wouldn't recommend it. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"A shambles of a 5 star that provided doss house quality of life This hotel claims to provide a 5 star service and facilities but falls very very far short in terms of delivery. Having stayed here for 6 nights there are clearly systematic problems in terms of management and infrastructure. a) plumbing/water. For one night we were without running water (or in lavatory), and often the water ran brown. The gurgling of the plumbing kept me awake long enough to have knock on effects for my meetings the following day. b) noise - a colleague of mine suffered from intermittent but persistent electric motor noises in some service shaft near his room. When eventually moved a day or so later, was moved to exact same position on another floor, with same environmental noise pollution.c) food - the quality and upkeep of the food is questionable. At breakfast the sliced tomato/cucumber was dried up and almost curling. The cheese board also in a poor state. poor range of food available for breakfast. In general, bizarre discrepancies between room srevice and restaurant menu - such that when asked for a light meal of mushroom soup followed by cheese selection in restaurant was told 'mushroom soup only available via room service'. So, had to go to room, order soup, wait 20 minutes, eat that, then descend to restaurant for cheese course. d) key system - on at least 5 occasions during stay the swipe card key to room became inactive, and so had to make long trip via slow lift service back to reception to get reactivated - I should put in expense claim for the time and travel involved !e) overall staffing attitude - the patina of obsequiousness displayed by the staff was not matched by the concept of service provision to the customer - obstructive and just plain unintelligent.The range of areas in which this hotel falls short amazes me - strongly recommend not to use this.

clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Would not be sad if I had to return The Qutab is a nice modern 7 storey building. Nice marble entrance, helpful and very friendly staff (bell captain, porters), okay reception staff and a nosy hotel manager (who once happened to come into our room without knocking and then only could stumble &quot;oh, sorry, do you wish something from the room service?&quot;. Still no clue what he really wanted. Rooms are spacious, some of them with great flatscreen tv, others with standard equipment. Good beds, minibar, in room safe, okay bathroom (not much water pressure in shower). Cosy bar/breakfast restaurant. Just around the corner, same complex, a very good Indian restaurant (expensive though, we paid 160 euro for two bottles of wine). Swimming pool looked good (but too cold to try, outdoor). Room airco should have heated room up (it was only 4 degrees outside) but did not. Everywhere in the hotel it was freezing cold. Internet access excellent (WiFi). They also have sauna/hamman/massage, did not try it out. Location: a bit out of where interesting things are happening, but for business meeting fine. All in all, was good, although a bit overrated perhaps. I would a next time still look for another option, but if I would not be able to find a better one (in terms of location) then I would not be sad having to go back. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Had a great time We stayed here last October. It was my first visit to India &amp; I was worried about what the hotels would be like. We stayed here for one night at the start of our tour &amp; for 2 nights at the end. We loved it. The rooms were very clean, modern, quiet &amp; comfortable.The pool area is very nice &amp; there are two restaurants on site. The buffet breakfast was excellent &amp; the staff would cook Euoropean breakfasts , if you asked. We found the coffee shop staff to be really helpful. They suggested where we could eat in Delhi &amp;, as we both love Indian food, they made us dishes which were not on the menu. The other restaurant was a bit smarter, but was also very good. We booked thsi as part of a package, so I don't know what the rate was. Woul agree with other reviewers about the attitude of the desk staff. Would stay here again &amp; would recommend. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Nice experience I stayed at the Qutab twice for a total of six nights in June 2007. I was nicely surprised by the stylish overall appearance, including the design and spaciousness of the room. Internet worked fine, and 2.5 Euros per hour is not an unusual charge. Food is not bad, and there is an additional, very stylish Indian restaurant in the compound that is quite good. You don't want to walk around in the neighborhood, except maybe into the park just next to the hotel. It takes 10 min by taxi to get into a lively part of town. I was booked into the hotel by my customer who gets a discounted rate that comes out at about 120 Euros / night. By Delhi standards, this is good value for money. If you have to pay the rack rate, things are obviously different. What I didn't like was the fact that I had to pay fully for the night of arrival (where I got into the hotel at 4 am) and the night of departure (leaving the hotel at 1 am). "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Not Recommended Rated and regarded as one of Delhi's Delux hotels the Hotel Qutab was a severe disappointment, being nothing better than a standard Holiday inn but at exhorbitant prices. I stayed in the hotel when I arrived and then upon my return from a Golden triangle Tour booked through Diplomatic Holiday in Delhi (which I would never do business with ever again). The first room was part of the tour with an enormous plasma television screen on the wall and nice toiletries including a silk bathrobe. I paid for the last wo nights as they were not part of the package and was vastly over-charged $200. U.S. for a much smaller room with a standard television. The food was generally good (but overpriced) and the service excellent. The drawback to this property is that it is not located in the downtown core of Delhi, if one can even identify a downtown core, but set admist absolute squalor. I felt as if I were a captive in the hotel. One short walk outside of the compound for some fresh air was enough for me. This property caters to mostly Indian business people and is definately not for a tourist visiting Delhi. Not recommended. "
clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"Hotel Qutab: Not the best value for your money Hi,I am an Indian national who stayed at Hotel Qutab along with my wife who is a US citizen. I stayed there for just 1 day during a 12 hour stopover before boarding an international flight back to the US from Delhi in November 2005.Firstly, if you call them and ask, they will tell you they are a 4-star or 5-star hotel. Hotel ratings are too inconsistent in Delhi, and most likely hotel staff in Delhi will tell you what you want to hear about their star rating. I would not give Hotel Qutab more than a 3-star rating for class/amenities and a 4-star rating for service. I paid $140 per night for my stay. But of course, in Delhi, demand is greater than supply for hotels, so they charge you whatever they can think of. I requested early check-in a week ago and it was promised when I paid for it a week earlier. Even if I wanted to check-in at 10:30 a.m. as opposed to the 12:00 p.m. check-in time, if there are no rooms available, they are not going to bother to let you know in advance. So I had to wait for an hour in the lobby while they waited on someone else to check out and get my room made. It was however nice of them to offer me some free tea :-) for making me wait, though it did not make a difference to me.Their air-conditioning unit seemed like it was started just before we walked into the room and did not work right for the few hours we stayed there. Their room service was good, the hot water worked great and the bed was comfortable. Their internet connection was down because their server was down, I'd think they'd be better equipped with all the money being charged for the room rates. I had wanted to check my flight schedules and they did not have a phone book with them to get hold of phone numbers. They did however connect me to the Yellow Pages hotline free of charge and I was able to obtain the required phone numbers.Upon check-in, I had confirmed that the payment was already made for the room. However, upon check-out, thanks to a lack of communication with the staff working in the evening, they had to make a bunch of calls again to make sure the payment was already made and made me wait a good 15 min. during check-out before confirming something they should have known.Sriram "

clarion collection qutab hotel apartments ,"I suspect that reception staff did not post our postcards My family and I stayed at the Qutab on 2 separate occasions in january 2005.On leaving we did not have time to go to the post office and post our holiday postcards - about 20 of them. So we left the money for postage with staff in the reception and someone promised to post the cards.Now, 3 months later, nobody has received a postcard. Not one single postcard arrived.What should I think ? "

conclave comfort ,"Nightmare It is totaly overpriced and pure nightmare. Staff sleeping on the floor and cleaning means spraying insecticides.The phone on the floor rings very loudly every time the hotel gets a call - annoying, it's impossible to sleep. The room is smelly, warm water tap doesn't work. Lot of parts have never been cleaned, fridge doesn't work and is very dirty. Breakfast room is ridiculous, dishes not clean. And so on! The hotel is just disgusting!Pay attention, there are 2 hotels in Delhi named &quot;Conclave&quot;. The other one is ok as far as I know. "
conclave comfort ,"Will Not Be Staying Here Any Time Soon Again!!! I am still trying to figure out how this place considers itself a step above others!!! We were booked to stay a couple of nights and we only stayed one. It was our last day in Delhi together and we wanted to get an early start to enjoy the entire day. Well, that was quickly thwarted when for some unknown reason, we could not get any hot water. The heater was on but it got lost in translation along the way from heater to shower head!!! But, let me back up a bit.Our first problem was with the A/C. At this property, there are wall unit air conditioners. I don't know how the other units look, but ours had a lovely brownish-yellow water stain framing it. Truly unsightly!! How difficult and how long would it take to just prime and paint that??? The A/C definitely had a mind of its own turning on, turning off, turning on, turning off! And every time someone came up to fix it, they set it to an arctic 19C degrees!!!So, let's go back to the hot water issue. After calling the front desk to report no hot water, a young man was sent up to investigate. I think he turned a few knobs, clicked the heater on and off and when I asked if it was ok, a gutteral grunt was the response. I wondered if that was yes or no. I am thinking now it was a no because after about a 10 minute wait, I checked again and still no hot water. Another call to the front desk. Now, the front desk person along with gutteral grunter show up. They tinker around a bit and tell us to wait 5 minutes and the hot water will come. It didn't. Call again. This time a barrage of people show up at the door and all file into our cramped room to further investigate the situation. Again, a suggestion to wait 5 minutes and they all shuffle out.Still no hot water. Call again. At this point, I am on the internet (which, by the way was great and perhaps the ONLY bright spot about this place) trying to find us another place to stay! We are told an engineer is on his way up. In the meantime, they send up gutteral grunter with a bucket of hot water to accommodate a shower for two people. Are they kidding? No thanks.The engineer shows up and assures us there will be hot water. At this point we have now lost about 2 hours or more from our day. Well, the hot water finally did arrive...we showered and promptly checked out, much to their amazement!!! How could they have been shocked over our departure??? The room was rather cramped, pretty dark and the mattress felt like it must have seen one too many guests - definitely in need of replacement. Again, the only bright spot was the internet connection which I will say was very good and although the room service was quite quick and the food reasonably tasty, it was without a doubt way over-priced!!We ended up in a 5 -star hotel after leaving this place paying a mere $81 more for the night than we paid for our one night at Hotel Conclave Comfort, but it was well worth it because our last night was spent in HEAVEN in comparison!!This place is WAY over-priced for the quality of room and service and I do not recommend it, not even for a one night stay!!!

corus hotel ,You get what you pay for Corus is supposed to provide a 3 star experience to a business traveler with limited budget and location (CP) in mind. For the frugal sorts whose budget is below 4K this seems to be the best place available. Though if you increase your budget to 5K there are better places.My experience was average with the following high/low points:The goods:1. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and the AC/TV/Mini Fridge worked well. They were small but as I said if you want to stay in CP for less than 4K your choices are limited.2. Staff is extremely courteous/professional and helpful.3. Cafe coffee day at the entrance and the general location is excellent as far as connectivity is concerned. (Inner circle B blcok)The bads:1. Problems with internet. In 4 days the internet was non functional for nearly half the time. A big nono for a business traveller.2. The buffet breakfast included in the price - is just plain bad. Didn't even bother going to the restaurant after the first morning. 
corus hotel ,"Comfortable Stay I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; enjoyed my stay . The hotel is very centrally located .The room had a wonderful view . I could see entire Connaught Place. alongwith the &quot;Central Park&quot;, ( I think that's what they call it ! ). The breakfast was included in the room rate , so we could have it in the room or in the restaurant with no extra charges. &quot; Bonsai &quot; the Restaurant very well done up , vibrant and fresh look , served excellent food and drinks in style ,( nice bar ! ) , not missing the wonderful outside garden area. Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back. "
corus hotel ,"Good location ok hotel.. by Delhi standards Corus was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in India and it certainly was not the best. This is to be expected of hotels in Delhi which are all over priced and not worth the cost.The location was great, right on the center ring of Connaught Place in between Old and New Delhi. The sidewalk and streets in front of the hotel were filthy and filled with people begging for money. But, upon entering the hotel the vibe is much better.. there's a great coffee shop in the front (with REAL coffee, hard to find in India). And the check-in lobby was welcoming. The staff were helpful were quick to respond when we needed something. The rooms overlook a (loud) restaurant/bar but we were never kept up by the noise. The rooms are on the small side but aren't bad. Breakfast.. just stay away from the fly covered fruit on the buffet and order from the menu. The food we got from room service was great!I would recommend this hotel if it's in your price range. "
corus hotel ,"Rooms 209-211 ONLY -- all the rest are dungeons We had three rooms for our group, two of which were dumps. No windows and no life. But one room on the top floor at the front of the building had access to a superb terrace with a gorgeous view of the Connaught Place. Others have complained about all kinds of aspects, and they're true. It's kinda dirty, the breakfast was terrible, and the rooms are horrid without the terrace. But, folks, this is Delhi. It's really hard to find a good place here without paying a fortune. The location of the Corus is superb, and for me that helped to make up for the downsides. I'd probably not go back unless I had rooms 209, 210 or 211 guaranteed. "
corus hotel ,"great location - dirty hotel Stayed with family for three nights at the beginning of a 3 week holiday. Though the location was convenient to every place we intended to visit, this hotel was a depressing first impression of what to expect in India. The tiny rooms could have been cleaner. Dirty, cracked windows gave us our first look outside. Staff was friendly and helpful - a positive! In retrospect, it would have been better to do a little more research prior to just booking with the tour agency (Indian Moments) and selected a different hotel based on the experience of other trip advisor travelers. Fortunately most of the other hotels were of higher quality than the Corus. "
corus hotel ,"Depressing experience Barely better than a backpackers hostel, this &quot;hotel&quot; wasone of the worst I have ever stayed in. Very noisy, rooms offexternal corridor backing onto dirty back streets. Very basic amenities,worn sheets, bug-tablets in &quot;bathroom&quot;, no hot water.No lift, had to lug bags upstairs.Breakfast minimal on patio next to streets.Unfortunately next step up was to 4-star hotels, more thandouble price, but we made it and were relieved and thrilled. "
corus hotel ,"Worst hotel I've ever stayed it BUT... Myself and 3 colleagues stayed at the Corus at the end of November for a week. The hotel was booked by our Indian colleagues and after reading the reviews on here I was a little concerned. However, although there were problems the hotel was reasonable - and much better than I had anticipated. The main problems were:- No hot water for showers- My room was the only room with a window- the shower flooded the bathroom when you used it- At night it was very noisy outside and my colleague had a boiler above his room which made noise constantly- The room serivce was terrible - microwaved, luke warm processed food- The beds were too short for a person of average height- The loo roll only had about 4 squares of paper!However, none of the above were massive problems for us. I used earplugs every night, kept asking for loo roll and braved the cold water and it was fine. I havent stayed in other hotels in India so have nothing to compare it to, but it exceeded my expectations - and there were some plus points:- The staff were always helpful and friendly - the manager in particular was lovely - The beds were fairly comfortable (after getting used to them!)- The mini bar was fine for drinks- We were all provided with a large free bottle of mineral water every day- The rooms were clean and I had no problem with bugs etc- We had airport pick up which was fineSo overall this hotel is fine if you are looking for somewhere just as a base, but I know it is fairly expensive and you could probably get something better for your money. "
corus hotel ,OK hotel We stayed here for one night at the beginning of our stay in India. We arrived to our room around 11 pm and requested an 8 am wake-up call. Either they misunderstood us or there 8 am looked like 3 am and guess what we were woken at 3 am. Our room was small with no window so we could only assume it was 8 am. We got dressed and then looked at our watch so we ended up drinking tea in the room until breakfast. Breakfast was outside in a patio area and was done very nice. They didn't put out an abundance of food so the hotel must have not been full but it was tasty. There is no elevator in the hotel. The lobby is up a flight of steps on the 2nd floor so if steps are a problem this would not be a good choice. It appeared to be in a good location of the city but we left early so only walked around the park which was across the street from the hotel. The hotel offers free internet service. This is a no frill hotel but was clean and adequate for one night. 
corus hotel ,"Mixed experience Hotel was reasonable, rooms very small but clean, excellent location right on the inner circle of Connaught Place. The first room we were shown had no windows but they then moved us to one at the back with a window off an external corridor. This was much brighter but anyone walking along the corridor could look through the window into our room meaning that we had to keep the curtains closed a lot of the time. There were a lot of bugs that came up through the shower drain, but perhaps this is just a feature of New Delhi.Reception staff seemed either exceptionally helpful or surly, no in between.There’s also a great coffee shop at the front and a nice restaurant/bar on the ground floor.Overall a reasonable hotel for the money, in a great location. Next time though, I might choose to spend a little more and stay elsewhere. "
corus hotel ,"Dirty and stained A friend booked this hotel through a travel agent and when I checked out the hotel on TripAdvisor, the pictures made it look much more promising than it really was. Walking in, I was taken aback by the trash on the stairs. The rooms weren't any better. A green chair had deep undertones of brown because it was so dirty. When I pulled back the blanket, the sheets and pillow cases were stained and was covered with strands of hair. The shower wall was covered with soap scum and grime. The air conditioning was either not in commission or at an uncontrollable full blast. The walls had obviously suffered some water damage and were stained.On the plus side, everyone who worked there went out of their way to try to be helpful.Still, would never stay at this hotel again. "
corus hotel ,"Cought the door bell man STEALING from my bags Horrible experience.Picture this. You go out for dinner and forget your camera. Go back to the hotel and, when you open the door to your room: surprise! There is the door bell man INSIDE THE ROOM STEALING FROM THE BAGS! I cought him in the act and I was shocked because he had broken into the room just after I left. The manager from the hotel asked me not to call the police, and try to &quot;digest it&quot;.Do I need to say anything else? "
corus hotel ,"One of the best options in New Delhi I worked in Delhi for a few months and needed a convenient hotel that stayed within my budget. Corus hotel ended up being my favorite option.Delhi is not a place famous for its service or efficiency, so bearing that in mind, Corus hotel was far and away better than its peers.The best part of the hotel is its location - the inner circle of Connaught Pl. You are right in the heart of Delhi and next to the subway/metro which is actually a safe and convenient way to get to some destinations in the city (e.g., Red Fort / Old Delhi).The rooms are small and some bathrooms are better than others, however, the place is quite clean, the beds are more comfortable than most, and typically, you do have hot water. (Please keep in mind that in India absolutely none of these things can be taken for granted.) The rate includes breakfast which is just OK, but better than nothing. There is a fairly good japanese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, with a garden. The food is pretty good, if a little expensive. Careful though - some nights it turns into a disco, so rooms in the 'back' of the hotel are sometimes subject to loud noise until 11 or 12 in the night. The hotel also has a decent room services and some continental options, as well as traditional Indian. A &quot;Cafe Coffee Day&quot; is connected to the hotel in the front, which is the Indian equivalent of Starbucks, which can be a nice bonus (the brownie sundae is recommended).Good luck! Bring plenty of pepto-bismal and immodium. You will need it -- but it will be worth it. "
corus hotel ,"not great but given location and cost probably a good option This hotel has a great location on connaught circle and the funky asian fusion restaurant with nice garden downstairs is also really good (had been craving california rolls so was happy to see the restaurant when we turned up!) The rooms however are not great. First time we stayed we had a standard room, which could also be called world's smallest room, and the bathroom, barely room to turn around. Still it was fairly clean but we didn't sleep well at all as we were right by the stairs so it was really noisy. Second time we stayed in the next grade of room up which was a much better size but had no window and had a funny mothball smell. They have little white balls in the sink (according to my husband you get these in urinals) and i found the smell really overpowering. Still from all my searching online for hotels in delhi it seems you either pay extortionate amounts for a luxury hotel and then peanuts for some really basic rooms so would say this is probably a good mid-range option. "
corus hotel ,"Best value in New Delhi Hotels in New Delhi are notoriously overpriced, and after four nights in subpar but highpriced hotels we stumbled across the Corus Hotel in Connaught Place. We liked what we saw and immediately booked a room for our return five weeks later. What a joyfull experience when we returned! Friendly, uniformed staff with excellent English skills and eager to help in every way; small, but spotless and beautifully furnished room with an excellent bathroom; serene isolation from the chaos of the city; interior garden restaurant. All the trimmings of a well-managed hotel. Price was Rs 5000...about US$135. The final graceful touch was after allowing a late checkout, they offered us the free use of an available room in which to rest before our late night departure to the airport. "
corus hotel ,"Make Sure You Don't Pay Much The Corus Hotel's location is very good - right in Connaught Place. The hotel itself is mediocre. Our room was small with a lot of ambient noise. The staff was friendly though the front desk was understaffed. As others have commented, there's no real lobby to the hotel - instead you walk through a cafe up some stairs to get to a tiny lobby. The breakfast however was very good. "
corus hotel ,"Avoid At All Costs! The first problem we encountered was finding this place as it has no frontage like most hotels, it is basically located upstairs inside the Bonsai restaurant. The reception area is small like a corridor, but adequate, nothing grand. We stayed at the hotel on two occasions over three weeks as the hotel was booked by the tour guide. On our first stay for 3 days the room was fine, nothing luxury about it just a basic room with a good view of Connaught Place central park. The next morning we discovered no hot running water, and had to call for assistance, the hotel staff made up a number of excuses regarding the boiler being broke, this is already on some of the reviews for this hotel left by others, so i was pre-warned! The third day the toilet stopped flushing so we had to call an engineer again, later the cold running water ceased to work from the bathroom washbasin. In the end they brought us a bucket of hot water with a jug to wash in, not very practical or hygenic but it was better than not batheing at all. The breakfast was absolutely rubbish, a mish mash of foods not edible together. The juices were very warm and not drinkable, the butter so hard you couldnt spread it on the toast. The restaurant itself was very basic, not the cleaniest place we've eaten at. On our second stay things got worse, we were given a room with no window, and again it had only luke warm water to bathe in...and no bath tub only stand in shower. Apparently out of 65 rooms only 6 have windows, so be warned, we had the premium room with a window!! The air con was extremely noisy so we switched it off, but the humidity in the room was awful as there was no air or natural light. Summing up this hotel, i would recommend you pay extra and try somewhere like connaught hotel. We stayed at 6 hotels during our stay in India and all the rest were good to pure luxury, this hotel is really a 1.5*, i couldtn give it even 2 stars as i dont think it is worthy of it. "
corus hotel ,"Not bad... I stayed in this hotel on October 2007 for 4 nights. Everything depends on what you expect from an hotel especailly if you are going to stay in Delhi... If you spend most of your time in the hotel to meet some friends or colleagues, I don't recommend it.. But if you are gonna be out of the hotel during the entire day and go to the hotel only to sleep, then there is no point to spend a lot of money to the other 5 star hotels which you need to pay between 300-500 USD per night... First of all this hotel's location is perfect... It's at the Inner Circle of Connaught Place [--] where you can find many international fast food restaurants, shopping places, post office, etc.. and close to the all local bazaars. The hotel is clean and modernly decorated. There is hot water but you need to wait for few minutes to get it as they most probably use solar panels during the day and central heating system at nights... If you order the cheapest room from their website, you'll stay in a room without a window.. Actually this is not a problem for me as I never stay in my room during the day. There was no big bath towel in the room but when you ask for it, they bring more than you ask. There is no hair dryers in the rooms either. You can ask for it too (if it's available) but it's not powerful. There is air condition, mini bar (without much options) and TV (showing mainly local channels) in the room. They have free wireless internet and I didn't face a connection problem. There is no lobby where you can sit and wait for someone but there is a modern-nice and popular coffee at the entrance of the hotel.. There is also a nice open air restaurant (Bonsai) in the hotel. I don't recommend to order a pick up service from the airport especially if you arrive to Delhi late at night. I have ordered one but there was no one waiting for me (Later, they apologized for the mistake and provided me a car for my departure). It's better to take a &quot;pre-paid taxi&quot; from the airport and go to the hotel by your self (I paid 350 rupees). The taxi drivers may not know the name of the hotel but if you tell the driver to take you to the Connaught Place Inner Circle, you will easily find the hotel. As a result, this is not the best hotel that I stayed so far but if you won't feel uncomfortable with some small problems, I can recommend it.. "
corus hotel ,"Worst Value Hotel in Four Month Trip I picked the Corus after reading the latest review in Lonely Planet. Don't make the same mistake. This hotel was totally over-priced for the quality of the experience. It cost 5000 rps, plus tax, for a double room. For that we got:- One hot shower in four days;- The shower cubicle filled with water after 2 minutes and completely flooded our bathroom.- The only way the staff could get the hot water to work was by turning on the hot water tap in the sink, and then letting the shower run for 10 minutes. But of course, that totally flooded the bathroom. - No window.- Only intermittent television and Internet reception.- The air conditioning system was so loud it kept us awake at night.- The staff were friendly, but unhelpful. When we had problems they couldn't fix them, and if they made any attempt they expected a tip. We needed an extra bed for one night, and it took us five calls to reception (over 8 hours) to get it. We only got it because we were going to bed and refused to leave the reception room until it was done.I was also annoyed at the price. When I rang the hotel to make the booking I was told it was 5000 rupees, tax included. When I came to pay I was told that tax was not included. I paid, but said I was annoyed at being misled on the phone. The hotel then lied and claimed that I had booked through a travel agent!Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel!!! For this price you can find a much better place in Delhi. "
corus hotel ,"Nice little place in the centre of town After looking on here for reviews, my colleague &amp; I said it looked a safe bet. The hotel has a very good location. The reception area is nice &amp; was being refurbished when we arrived. My room was in the main block &amp; had no windows. It was very quiet. Air con &amp; fan worked really well. The only problem was getting hot water. There was never any. I didn't mind too much as it was extremely hot and humid so a cold shower suited me fine. The free internet was a bonus too. I would recommend this hotel to others. The price was good. A nice restuarant is included inside the hotel too. "
corus hotel ,"Many probelms with the Corus! We booked this hotel because a collegue from work recomended this place and because Hotels in Delhi are overcharged and we didn't wanted to spend so much. We booked directly with their webpage and also payed for the airport pick up, since we arrived late at night. When we arrived to the airport, no one was there to pick us up. We had to pay a pre-paid taxi from the airpot who brought us to Connaught place, but once we were there he told us he didn't know this hotel. The streets were deserted so he entered another hotel to ask for directions at 1am in the morning! No one knew how to get to the Corus. After half an hour of asking and being lost we finally arrived. We were furious to know why they didn't picked us up at the airport, but to our surprise they didn't even had our reservation since their webpage took one day to process the information (but didn't say so in the web page!!!) The hotel is ok, the bed is clean but the bathroom is awful! no hot water! no comfort at all and found many big insects at the shower. The breakfast buffet is good, and the restaurant staff very kind. However the front desk staff was almost rude and unprofessional. After this experience we suggest to pay a little bit more to be in a nicer hotel but be more confortable in Delhi and enjoy more the city. "

We stayed here for 3 nights after arriving in India for a 3 week tour.The room was large but with grubby sheets,tepid water and the special bonus of blood stained towels!The breakfast which comes to the room is only white sliced toast although we noticed Indian guests having cooked food in the corridor as there is no dining room.Mysteriously we got a letter from the Manager telling us chicken was off the menu due to bird flu!The one saving grace is the location at the heart of Connaught Place with a new Metro station outside and you can walk in the evening to a number of good quality restaurants very close by.

corus hotel ,"False Impressions Their motto is &quot;Hospitality Redefined&quot; which, after reading this personal account, is quite apt but for all the wrong reasons.Dirty, old sheets (one covered in blood, which was not removed after 3 requests), cold showers (was told to run the water for upwards of 5 mins - but even longer running time led to no more than strictly lukewarm), no restaurant / eating room (breakfasts in your own bedroom (no table, only 1 chair - none of which is conducive to business travel), generator blasting away just outside our rooms (accessed via a balcony-style corridor, overlooking a shambles outside), phone bills charged to your room, no toilet paper, only Pepsi in the room bar, no offstreet parking, no formal hotel entrance, but instead a flight of steps up from street level, a street covered in dust &amp; traders.All this for the exhorbitant fee of U$155 nightly, plus 12½% Delhi hotel tax fee. Owner would not budge when asked for a refund, based on the above issues. It just so happened that Delhi was more or less fully booked for a Trade Convention, so no chance of relocating, otherwise I would have done so.Definitely not 3-star material, don't be fooled by the name, their motto or the web pictures.In short, avoid like the plague.

corus hotel ,Hotel MINABLE 
cottage yes please ,"Cashing in on their success As we are right now staying at Cottage Yes Please, a word of warning to anyone who might get too excited from the good reviews on this site.They have started charging on the Wi-Fi use, 100 rupees per day. Double room price at 900, and although the rooms are reasonably clean and quite nice, most are nothing like the photos on their web site.A big minus is that they seem to be happily giving a cold shoulder to people with confirmed bookings. They did it to us and to another couple this week, just because we arrived late in the evening (which we had told them before and they had replied it was ok). We had arranged the booking by e-mail and the other couple even face to face at the hotel - no help, they just told us they were full and told to go to their sister hotel, Cottage Crown Plaza nearby. The guy at the Yes Please desk was rude and aggressive and said that he did not care if we had a booking or not, if we didn't want the sister hotel, we should go on the street and look for other places. We were tired, so just haggled about the price and went to Crown Plaza, which was decent but no Wi-Fi.As we really needed a place with Wi-Fi, we returned to Yes Please for this stay. OK value, but not good service.The Fiesta cafe just opposite this place has good breakfasts and coffee, and free Wi-Fi if you give them your ID. "
cottage yes please ,"The best in Phar ganj Area You may find dirt cheap hotels in the pahar ganj area but it's really worth to pay a little bit more more a bit more calm and peace of mind and wi-fi. They have an elevator, free luggage storage, they offer airport pick up and drop off for a minimal fee. They also offer city tour by a private taxi. So you wont have to ask for more. "
cottage yes please ,"Great place! We just stayed at Cottage Yes Please and found it very nice, clean, a good value for Delhi. Our room was large (3 beds, one off in a little alcove), the AC and fan worked great, TV was great, and bathroom was clean. The only suggestion I would make is for the management to put a hook up so that the hand-held shower thing can be used as a regular shower. They have no restaurant, but the South Indian Veggie place across the street (Malhotra's Dosa Please) is so amazingly good and open all day (they even boxed up our order to go and we ate it on the airplane home!). We had stayed in another hotel on Main Bazaar (Vivek) and found it so much worse for the same money. Cottage Yes Please has friendly and helpful staff and a nice guy that says &quot;Namaste&quot; to you when you come and go out the front door. The only downside is that they no longer have free wifi -- it costs 100 rupees per day now. "
cottage yes please ,"What a welcome !!! After having checked many hotels in Paharganj;I chose this one because I needed a WiFi connection. When you arrive at the reception, heavily loaded and tired, you are requested to show your passport as they cannot wiat 15 minutes for you to get in the room, unload and refresh. Then, they demand you pay in advance - even if you are out of local currency and you have stacks of dollars to show them. So I would say that please, give m one hour to rest and I'll pay when I have recovered from my journey.Hot water is more like medium hot. Windows are tapped with an outside wall. "
cottage yes please ,OK Hotel Stayed here for 3 nights+ OK staff+ Good location for travelers+ Room service+ Good rooms- no hot water in the room- driver we organized to the airport through them kept falling asleep at the wheel (not technically their fault)3/5 
cottage yes please ,"Good value free WiFi close to New Delhi railway station I've stayed here twice, and would stay again. I'm sure this is the cheapest price you'll find for a WiFi-enabled hotel in Delhi, especially of this caliber. (If you don't need WiFi you can find some cheaper digs, but maybe not the same standard of quality and cleanliness.)Staff was fine, the rooms were clean, and I had no problems.The hotel is one street over from the Main Bazaar road in an area called Pahar Ganj. On the plus side, the Bazaar is teeming with activity and there are endless shops where you can get any kind of inexpensive handicrafts, clothes, colorful tapestries, henna body painting, etc. Another plus is that the New Delhi Railway station is at the end of the Bazaar Road. It's maybe a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, and of course there are also bicycle rickshaws. The downside of the area is that it's rather grimy and crowded. The hotel is kind of funny there, like a diamond in a pile of mud.The hotel has no restaurant but there are two directly across the street. You can order room service and the food will come from there. The restaurants are inexpensive. If I remember right most entrees were around 50 rupees (US $1).While I was there I needed to buy a laptop and the gentleman at the travel desk recommended I go to Nehru Place, which was spot on, that's definitely the place to buy computer goods. I tried to offer him a Rp100 tip to thank him for his help, but he actually refused -- a rarity in Delhi where everyone seems to be after your money.One of the staffers speaks Japanese and their website is in English and Japanese, so a fair number of guests are Japanese. The website annoyingly does not list their rates, but the lowest level is around Rp900/night. "
cottage yes please ,"Clean comfortable bargain We chose Cottage Yes Please after reading a number of positive reviews, and we were not disappointed. For 800 rupees a night -- about $17 US -- we got a clean and comfortable place to stay with free wi-fi. We stayed five nights overall.The hotel is on a side street off the main Pahar Ganj bazaar. It's the filthiest neighborhood I've ever stayed in, with mud and livestock in the streets. There must be a hundred or so hotels and guesthouses in the area. We saw prices of 4 dollars a night, but I was not tempted.The hotel is quite a contrast with the neighborhood. There's a lot of marble at Cottage Yes Please -- floors, stairs, the lower third of walls -- and that contributes to both a cool feeling and easy cleaning. I think there are four floors. I didn't count the rooms, but it's big enough to have two lifts.Our only complaint was that the &quot;hot&quot; water in the shower was only lukewarm.The hotel owns two pretty good restaurants across the street -- Malhotra and Dosa Please. We ate breakfasts at Malhotra, which includes continental and Chinese food on its menu. "
cottage yes please ,"Totally OK - with wifi! Good hotel considering the price and location. Reasonably clean, though there seemed to be a small colony of cockroaches residing under the fridge...Fully functional and reasonably priced wifi.Location is good: it's in dingy Pahar Ganj/Main bazaar, but really close to the metro station so you don' t really have to walk through Pahar Ganj if you don't want to. Nice staff.The room service was so-so though: the restaurant that delivers the food got the orders wrong and the food was not great.But for the price (950 for a single with AC) I was pleased and will return. "
cottage yes please ,not bad considering delhi standards... It was our first night in Delhi and we decided to stay in Pahar Ganj area. We arrived late in the evening and we booked the pick-up from the Airport. We found a guy waiting for us with a big board and we arrived at the hotel around midnight. The a/c room (was a triple) was ok and clean but very hot before the noisy a/c refreshed it. The view from the balcony was a high wall around it but this area doesn't offer good point of view.. It was clean and the staff friendly. The price (1500 rs) was high for the standard but sleeping in Delhi is very expensive.In front of the hotel there is a sort of restaurant for breakfast or diner.Compared to other guesthouses seen on internet it was a good choice. 
cottage yes please ,"Be careful... The hotel itself was reasonable and clean, especially in comparison to the majority of places in new delhi. However, the AC did not work for half of the time, and there was hot water for about 5 minutes in total. The worst suprise came at check out time. We were billed for 3 nights, when we had only spent two nights at the hotel, on the spurious grounds that we had arrived before 12 noon on the first day of our stay. After losing our tempers the &quot;manager&quot; reduced the fee to half a day, but in any case our last day in India was dampened by this example of dishonesty. "
cottage yes please ,"compare to Delhi clean hotel I reccomend the room 406, it has three beds and quite big room. It locates at Phar Ganj, very convinience to go to Agra. The hotel is very clean, staffs are so nice. All kinds of facilities are available, ex, train booking, taxi, internet, money change. I hope that now the restaurant on roof top is started, when I was there, it was under construction. "
cottage yes please ,"Average Hotel This place looked more promising then most in the Paharganj area in Delhi, the entrance and the building look new. The rooms are ok, a reasonable size with some natural light, and ours had a fridge and tv. I don't think it is being maintained too much though, there were stains down the walls which I'm sure could have been removed with a good clean. We had an a/c double room which was IR850 which was ok for what we got, relatively. Room service is supplied by the restaurant across the road and was reasonable. Be careful of onlookers through your window though as the buildings are very close! "

crest inn hotel new delhi ,Horrible Just stayed for one night. Looks very run down from the outside...a lot different from the online photos.The greeting room/ entrance is fairly nice. Dont be lulled into a false sense of security though. The rooms are dirty and beds uncomfortable. Bathrooms old and dirty with no hot water (even when asked specifically if we wanted hot water we did not get any).Staff unhelful and annoyingly pestering for tips despite not even helping.Didnt eat breakfast there...didnt dare. 
crest inn hotel new delhi ,"Choose rm# 409 or 410 Karol Bagh... This is a good hotel for a max. 3 nite stay, anything more and you don't want to be located in Karol Bagh. Rooms #409 &amp; #410 are the only renovated rooms in this hotel. Located on the same floor as the restaurant. Nice breakfast but horrible dinners. I wouldn't suggest ordering anything, walk around the corner and get a veggie burger at McDonalds. Karol Bagh is really busy - I suggest not staying in this area if at all possible. The only food options are McDonalds and the Indian sweet shop - Bikanervala. Book on makemytrip.com for best pricing. "
crest inn hotel new delhi ,"Warning about Crest Inn's Bus Tour to Agra/Taj Mahal I just wanted to let people know that you need to be very careful about bus tours to Agra. I took the bus tour that departs from the Crest Inn. I thought it would be a safe bet because the Crest Inn website has a page devoted to the bus tour so it seemed relatively professional and structured for tourists. Not so. It was the off season so I was the only non-Indian, english-speaker on the bus. The driver was curt and didn't understand my questions and attempted to leave without me after breakfast. He was only stopped from doing so because they got a flat tire just a couple hundred feet down the road. I'd like to think this wasn't intentional, but I feel it's pretty tough not to notice that the one white person is not onboard. Then, when we came to the first stop in agra (the Red Fort), I split off from the group because they aggressively encouraged me to take a different guide that speaks all English, promising me that we'd all meet at the bus out front. But when we had finished our tour, my bus was nowhere to be found. Luckily there are infinite transportation-for-hire options in India so I was able to make it to the Taj Mahal and home again using alternate transportation. But the trip is a long, hot, stressful one as it is so I'd advise anyone considering a bus tour to consider alternate options or else make very good friends with the driver. "
crest inn hotel new delhi ,"Everything is New The Crest Inn hotel is not located in the best part of Delhi, but to their credit, once you are inside everything is brand spanking new. Our hotel room even still had its furniture in a semi-wrapped state! This is one of the cleanest places you will find in Delhi, it was the only place where the bedsheets and towels did not need to be changed out the minute we entered the room. We also loved the way the room was set-up, especially the presence of a large double bed. Two downsides remain with this inn--the shower area in the bathroom is not segregated so be prepared to have a very wet bathroom floor after you've taken a shower! Secondly, the hotel restaurant is not much for food, so be prepared to head out for all your meals. "
crest inn hotel new delhi ,"Terrible rooms I recently stayed at this hotel with my family. The hotel is very old. Even though the rooms have had a recent make-over, i would advise you to stay away from this place. The bathrooms have bath tubs which leak and the toilets do not flush properly. Breakfast is served in an untidy small room and is often not prepared preoperly. The staff were very pleasant however and tried to make our stay comfortable. Please avoid this hotel "
crest inn hotel new delhi ,trashy hotel Bad-tempered and dishonest people We booked the hotel through a travel agent but when we came (1AM) they told us that they hadn't any booking ; we were forced to look for an other hotel (first night in India...) in the late night... we found it thanks to the taxi driver.The last day we came to settle the problem but they just told us that it was a mistake &amp; didn't want to pay us back ... 
crest inn hotel new delhi ,"Good value for the price We were staying in New Delhi for 3 weeks and wanted to minimize our expenses, especially since we believed that we would also be using room service alot. The hotel was booked by a travel agent and the 2 star rating was lower than we had talked about. The room we had, had not been remodeled yet, however, I thought that with a few repairs and detailing the room would justify a higher rating. We felt that the room was cleaner than we expected. We didn't see any bugs or big problems. During the day we could here alot of remodeling going on in other rooms in the hotel. The hum of the air conditioner pretty much drown out the road noise, it kept the room plenty cool. Room service was good. The menu was pretty good and the food reasonable priced for room service. Chowmein and a order of spring rolls was less than $5 US and seemed to be plenty to eat for the 2 of us. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. We usually tipped 10 %, but some of the staffed seem surprized. The area looked scarey, but we never felt in danger wandering down the streets. I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveler. "

crowne plaza delhi ,"Appalling Food I lived n Delhi or a year and have to return once a month flying in from Mumbai. I have tried several hotels and this is without doubt the worst food I have eaten in any hotel in any capital, the breakfast was so bad it defies description vegetarian omellete with bacon in it, uncooked eggs served as an omellette, hairs on the food, so bad we left without eating. Room service, we ordedred a salad wth bread ad they were 3 potato crisps, inedible! Therooms were ok but small. Stay if you are desperate foor a room, otherwise avoid at all costs "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Don't eat here! Overall the hotel is nice, the room is comforable and clean and serviced well. The room service staff are friendly and eager to please but if you don't keep the privacy button on they will knock frequently in the hope of tips! The reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion I needed to speak wih them. Haven't tried the pool but it looks well maintained and relaxing. My main complaint is the food. The breakfast offer is terrible - cheap nasty cereals, runny porridge, runny yoghurt, runny scrambled egg that was white!! Mini single serving pots of jam on the tables were already used! And worst of all a curly black hair on the overcooked greasy bacon. The room service is prompt but never seemed to come with everything described on the menu and was generally cold and greasy. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor wasn't too bad but nothing to shout about. Overall, not impressed for a hotel of this standard. I stayed at the Intercontinental last time I was here on business and would rather stay there next time. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Quiet hotel in a busy city It was our first time in India and at a Crowne Plaza hotel. We were not disappointed in our choice. On arrival everything during registration was completed while we had a cold drink. Our room overlooked the pool and entrance to the hotel. The room was quite large with a very welcome fridge, there were always bottles of water on our return every day.The Atrium bar is lovely and quiet but like everywhere in India expensive. The first night we ate in the hotel, think it was called Le Cafe, it is where the breakfasts are served, we did not have the buffet although it looked very good. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our tour.We ate a a Chinese not too far from the hotel and felt perfectly safe walking around. During our stay in April the pool was very cold but the pool area was pleasant.Would recommend this hotel if you want to stay away from the very busy city. My only negative would be the price of using the business centre to access the Internet, very expensive.Staff were polite and helpful. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Beautiful LIke most 5* hotels in India, this is a great stay. Great staff, food and entertainment. The pool is amazing also. You can rent a driver and car and tour around Delhi, which is amazing. It was my birthday when we booked in and as you have to give your passport they saw the date and arrived up to my room with a birthday cake, present and flowers. Staff are amazing and add a very personal touch to everything. "
crowne plaza delhi ,Crowne Plaza - Should first learn the meaning of Hospitality!!!

crowne plaza delhi ,"Exceeded Expectations Almost We were at this hotel for only two days. The service was way above standard for India, about average by Canadian standards. The rooms were the cleanest of anywhere we stayed in India and it was a treat to stay somewhere where there were no major upkeeps needed- rare it seems in Delhi. The food was average in the restaurant, but the service was quick. In fact, the room service was above average. They delivered to us outside of hours and within minutes. The only problem we had was at check out. We had booked through Travelocity which charged our Visa two months in advance, so we had already paid. They charged us again at check out, so we were double charged. The gentleman at the front desk said that travelocity only held the room, which I knew was not true. We are currently working with travelocity to receive a refund for the first charge. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Only So-So; Should be Improved I was here for a week-plus. The hotel was booked by local colleagues for its location to the office, and sort-of-good facilities. It was only a fair stay all around.My room on the 6th floor was small and cramped feeling, as was the bathroom. All of the typical business-class hotel amenties are there: ironing board, TV, bathroom toiletries, internet access, etc. Housekeeping was fine, but the room is starting to feel worn.We ate in every retaurant in the hotel since our days were very long we were too tired to venture out much. While none of them were bad, none of the restaurants were particularly good, either. The restaurant on the top floor that had some Thai AND Italian items on the menu (not a good sign) played dorkey 80's music at dinner. I recommend that you explore the area for dining, ask for recommendations outside the hotel, etc. if you have the energy. The price/value will also be better, I'm sure.The staff are well-meaning and try hard, but are not polished. Better training would help as you can tell they are trying to please -- it's not an attitude problem.The pool looks nice, but I had no time for it.The surrounding area is not that attractive, but partly that's Delhi, i.e. trash everywhere, traffic, no sidewalks, etc.So: the stay was not a disaster, but I'll try to stay elsewhere when back in Delhi. India has traditionally not welcomed international investment in infrastructure, and it shows in the price/value of the available hotels. But there are better in town.(Filed for my husband - he won't get his own account.) "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Could be better was there with some business partners from Japan, overall OK but for the kind of charges they have it cld have been better, they have customised services for japanese guests like TV channels, breakfast in japanese style etc. Food is not too great for the kind of money they charge, better to eat out in the shopping arcade outside the hotel "
crowne plaza delhi ,Extravagant party The staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel New Delhi is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. I was forced into the higher price and didn' t know until check out. We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted. One of the managers came to the hospital to speak with us. I was impressed. We went back after I left the hospital. Room was lovely. Used hotel guide/driver for 3 days. Awesome! He made our trip! Service slow in main restaurant and food not to our liking. The Japanese restaurant was awesome! 
crowne plaza delhi ,"Good quality and reasonable value I've stayed in the Crowne Plaza, Friend's Colony, Delhi on many trips. The property is large and well-appointed if not particularly attractive to look at fomr the exterior.The rooms are comfortable and clean. The food is good and room service very efficient. In some areas the property is beginning to look a little tired/out of date but that is a minor observation. The location is handy for New Delhi and anyone travelling/working across south Delhi/Noida. It's in a peaceful, upmarket suburb. The gym is modern, well-equipped and well-managed and the pool is popular. The property attracts large up-market groups of tourists, local business-types, flashy parties and business travellers. At the time of writing (June 2009) the room rates are competitive but as always everything else (e.g. laundry/food/wi-fi) is comparatively expensive. "

crowne plaza delhi ,"Poor value In my experience the two superior hotel chains in the Intercontinental group - Intercontinental and Crowne Plaza - play weather-man and woman on pricing but Intercontinental is consistently superior on quality. This was certainly borne out by my experience here. This time around Crowne Plaza was a tad more expensive (for which read extortionate; this is Delhi, after all) than the admirable Nehru Place Intercontinental (full, alas) but some way behind on quality. The walls of the 'executive lounge' appear to have been painted by the same five year old responsible for the grouting around the shower! "

crowne plaza delhi ,"A great place to stay if you have the misfortune of being in Delhi Let's face it, New Delhi is not the greatest place to stay in what is the wonderful country of India. Sure, it's convenient for Aggra and as a brief stop-off before going to the North, but not really a great destination in it's own right. Anyhow, if you do happen do be in New Delhi (I was for 8-days on business April 2009) then I certainly recommend the Crowne Plaza. The rooms are excellent by any country's standards, and the staff are friendly and good fun if you make the effort to talk with them. The restuarants are pretty good (although sometimes a little pricey for what you get) and the bar is functional enough, although like others have said, lacking a bit in atmosphere. What really stands out at the Crowne Plaza Delhi is the excellent Gym and Spa. I used the gym every day I was there, followed by a sauna and swim. No charges, this is complimentary and of the highest quality. I paid 800rupees for a great shoulder and back massage too. The area that the hotel is placed in (New Friends Colony) is pretty crappy, but then again, where exactly is nice in Delhi? There are brief power cuts every day (but you have to expect this) but the gym treadmills are not affected by this!! The only downside for business stay as far as I was concerned is the slow internet connection which was pretty much non-functioning for the entire time I was there. Anyway, highly recommended hotel, especially for business - a bit of an oasis in Delhi! "

crowne plaza delhi ,"Don't stay there! We had three separate one night stays here during a tour in India.Night 1- we were put in a disabled room, not ideal as we are both able bodied, but as only one night we put up with it.Night 2-we arrived early evening and when we switched on the lights some worked, some didn't, the TV and air con did not work. The electrician arrived quickly but by then we had been allocated what was supposed to be a premium room and as the paperwork had been completed we moved.( we had originally had a superior room). The smell of urine hit you as you walked into the room, we quickly realised that it was coming from the air con. By now it was getting late to eat so we again thought , only one night we will leave the air con off.Night 3- we arrived 11.00 pm. This room again smelled of urine but was superior room on the 2nd floor, again the air con was the problem, as all we wanted to do was sleep we left the air con off.The reception area was pleasant, some of the staff were surly others OK.Restaurant overpriced and staff not particularly helpful.Business centre charge for 30mins minimum for use of computer - £7.50 on current exchange rate.Would never recommend this hotel.

This hotel, perhaps is the best in Delhi for business travellors. well connected to delhi and neihghbouring states UP, Haryana etc. The Shopping arcade &amp; food courts adjacent to the Hotel is the best. Very spacious lobby too, Rooma are big and has excellent view. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Crown Plaza-Always a pleasure Crown Plaza in Delhi is always a great pleasure to stay in. It has good restaurant, good rooms and good location. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Excellent for a long business stay I stayed here for almost 3 months. The hotel is one of the best that I have come across in New Delhi. It has all the modern amenities that are required for a business hotel. The property is crunched for space, but that does not make the place less attractive. The food is very good, variety is low but access to resteraunts in the shopping center next door makes up for this. The fare has risen in the last few months, but corporates do tend to get attractive discounts especially for long stays. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Crowne Plaza Delhi is way better than what you get in the States After and exhausting day touring Delhi it was nice to get some peace and quiet. The restaurant and bar were very nice, but really expensive. The breakfast buffet was really good, everything is geared toward Japanese and Western tourists. The service is amazing and rooms were very comfortable. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Reasonable business stay - India style After 4 visits to Delhi, this has become my hotel of choice three different times- due to my company budget policy- around $200.The recent Indian currency depreciation helped- so 9,000-10,000 rp now translates to just $200 vs. over $250 6 months ago.Positive:Hotel management responded to my complaint- at the manager's reception I was upgraded to club room with less noise.Certain issues:1. Short power outage, happens several times a day, even in the lobby- after terror attacks, I was kind of alerted.2. Avoid connecting room- noise from neighboring room is too loud- I heard the cough next door all night long the first night.3. Flush noise from toilet- you are out of luck everytime your neighbor flush the toiletIt is really important you know which room to check-in, completely different experience.....Food: Chinese restaurant serves typical European-Chinese food, not interesting for Asians, especially Chinese people at all. Tried once reluctantly after invited by fellow Western travellers. Chef was trained by Chinese chef before.Indian food- 'seven' is great- my favorite : Prawn CurryNew club room is okay with flat screen, which visually enlarged the room. Better than InterContinental Grand, feel safer than Le Meridien.... Payment- be careful about DCC conversion, which adds 2-3% on your bill in $. Took me several months to ontain refund , check clearly when sign, insist on paying in local currency.Location is not ideal- only close to Humanyun's Tomb and Purana Qila, good to visit, plus Lodhi Garden for a relaxed afternoon- no way to get a taxi back.... "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Nice hotel poor location Decent typical international chain hotel with large, clean and well equipped bedrooms and bathrooms. Nice bar and restaurants. There was a Goan promotion at the Seven Restaurant during my visit and the food and ambience was excellent. The main problem is the location, with nothing to attract close by except for a large shopping complex. The surroinding area is quite filthy and the hotel is some distance from both the cultural centre of Delhi and the international airport (over half an hour - a full hour in busy periods - from each). "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Good hotel for a busy city Hotel rooms in India are expensive but in this hotel you receive exactly what you need after a busy day in the city (clean rooms, bathroom, comfortable bed, international TV channels, internet, etc). The food of the Indian restaurant in the hotel is very good. The buffet breakfast has a lot of choices both asian and western.The restaurant staff was very friendly. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Very Comfortable Anyone who has been to Delhi knows that it's hectic...well this hotel will give you a pleasant retreat.All the staff were very helpful and courteous and even those you just passed in a hallway would always smile and say hello. The cleanliness was good in the rooms and around the hotel. I only noticed an odd smell once lurking about the hallways on my floor and I couldn't decide if it was a rather unpleasant cleaning fluid, something more human or a mixture of both! Food wise they have a very good Chinese restaurant on the 7th floor that has views over the city. It's pricey compared to what you could pay outside but the food does come in large portions (one dish would probably fill you up). They have a 24 hour cafe/restaurant on the ground floor which serves Indian and Continental dishes. For those that fancy a real break from the deeply tasty Indian dishes, or if you just fancy a midnight snack...they rustle up a good plate of fries which are great sandwiched between some butter naan! This cafe also doubles up as the breakfast room in the mornings where a decent buffet breakfast is served up with a good range of Indian and Continental. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby that sells cakes and pastries which are as tasty as they look. My final word on food, is that as far as I can see and from my experience, it is safe and clean. I was travelling with approx. 25 people and nobody got ill.The rooms are of a decent size and comfortable. The first time I stayed I was in a standard room which was absolutely fine. However, if you have a little extra cash, definitely go for a deluxe room. Slightly more space, flat screen TV mounted on the wall, lights and air con (plus a few other things) can be controlled from a small touch pad next to the bed and your own iron and ironing board in the cupboard. All the rooms have tea and coffee making facilities, two small complimentary bottles of water and an in room safe.There are some gift shops on the floor below the lobby and an outdoor swimming pool on the 1st floor. I didn't use either but the latter I wish I had if only there was the time!Location wise it is very close to the Lotus Temple and there are some shops and an ATM if you take the exit behind the hotel then do a left. Currency can be readily exchanged at the 24 hour desk in the lobby.I liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Great Hotel surrounding area not so good Great hotel with good service overall. The rooms are well equipped but on the small side. Tried out the 2 restaurants - the top Chinese restaurant was very good although quite pricey for India standards - the bottom one was not all that great on the food, seems to cater more for buffet dinners. Staff generally very helpful. The pool area was a bit small and lacking but then who goes to Delhi to stay by the pool? Not much in the surrounding area except small shops and restaurants. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Better after moving to a deluxe room We first booked two superior rooms through their website and requested a non-smoking room. However, when we checked in, we got a smoking room, and one of the room was a wheel-chair accessible one, which we did not ask for.We then changed to one deluxe room. The room was nicer, and at the end of the hall so maybe a little bigger. There was a king size bed but because we were three of us, we had to pay for 2 extra persons. I don't understand why this was so because we only asked for one rollaway bed, which at first was a separate mattress on the floor! We refused to accept the mattress and asked for a proper rollaway. If they are going to charge extra, why should we have to sleep on the floor!Service at the front desk was polite and efficient. They guided us well with all our inquires. In between, we checked out for 2 days to visit Jammu and they let us keep our extra luggage for free and kept an arriving parcel for us. They brought us a free fruit basked and mini-chocolates in our deluxe room (but not to our intial superior room,)The dinner we had at their restaurant, Seven, was nice. There was a ghazal group singing. It was my parents anniversary so they brought us complimentary cake. Their morning breakfast at Le Cafe was good with variety.Good stay for good service. "
crowne plaza delhi ,Pleasant stay Stayed here at beginning and end of tour in India booked with Jetsave. Reception area lovely and pool very nice with beds in shade. Unfortunately several swimming lessons for local children held in the pool made it crowded and noisy at evening time when you wanted to use it. Room good with complimentary bottles of water and tea and coffee making facilities All our meals were paid but drinks pricy here. 
crowne plaza delhi ,"lEnjoyed the Crown Plaza New Delhi India. Crown Plaza Suyra May 14-20 2008. Eileen Queens,N.Y. My stay at the Crown Plaza new delhi India was a happy and memorable one. The hotel is located nearby shopping areas, banks, resturants local markets ect. . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel for the nice rooms with all ammenties,the pool was great, spa was very good I enjoyed that very much after along day touring. Good relaxation in the evening with three resturant to have dinner, casual an elegant dining in the evening with live indian music, a bar for evening cocktails ect. This hotel has a nice decor to it and is fit for any kind of traveller,for business,tourist,or family vaccations ect. The friendliness of all the staff is kind and careing, from the doormen to the bellhops,the resturant staff . The staff and the managers for the day and night shift was very pleasant and careing. Checking in was very pleasant and checking out was also pleasant. When travelling around the world and staying in hotels it is our home away from home and with a open mind one should make the best of our holiday .I enjoyed my stay and if I should travel to India in the futureI will choose this hotel for my stay. My thanks to all at the Crown Plaza Suyra in New Delhi India. Suyra the Sun shines bright in you always "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Not worth the money The hotel is out of the way from the airport and main tourist areas. According to staff, there was nothing to see within walking distance of the hotel. Rooms were OK, but walls were pretty banged up, and the bathroom smelled awful - a damp smell that would seem to come and go for no reason. Worst part, was getting ripped off for the airport pickup. My room was booked through work, and no one mentioned airport pickup, so when I arrived, I went to the pre-booked taxi stand, paid 300 rupees, got my receipt and headed towards the taxis. On my way there, I noticed my name on a sign from the hotel. He told me the ride was complimentary, one of the services the hotel offers, so I cancelled my taxi. Upon checkout, I questioned the 3000 rupee charge, and was told it was for airport pickup. Staff refused to accept that I was told it was complimentary, and demanded that I pay it. I was with a co-worker, who also heard it was complimentary. Now, I dont even really care about the money, work pays for it, but it is the principle of it that bothers me. I was told it was free, then charged 10X more than the regular taxi rate. That left a bad taste in my mouth. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"A good few days I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights in April. The hotel certainly looks better inside than it does from outside. Since I last stayed there eight years before it has had a big refit. The main open areas are airy and bright, nicely fitted out and while the bar area below reception lacks atmosphere it’s a good place to meet. My room on the forth floor was good, nicely fitted out with good facilities. Service was very good – I was met at the airport by the hotel car, reception was helpful and service at the bars and restaurants attentive. Breakfast buffet was very good, especially if you like Massala Dosa for breakfast like I do, there was a good selection including omlettes and fruit. The evening buffet was very good and a meal in Seven, the a-la-carte restaurant was excellent. The location is little too far south if you want to get to the central tourist spots in Delhi, but it can be a quick ride if the traffic is good to you, All in all a good stay and based on my experience a good hotel that justifies it’s rating "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Large hotel with spacious public areas and decent rooms My business colleagues booked three nights for me in the Crowne Plaza during a recent business trip to our nearby India headquarters.The public spaces are spacious and flashy, and are intended to impress. My Club level room was large and comfortable. The Club level breakfast buffet was not overly large or varied, but entirely adequate for my needs. I did not personally experience the other restaurants. I did not take advantage of the large pool.The staff was overall reasonably professional. The Club level clerk who checked me in was cold, bureaucratic, and officious, with little sympathy for the late hour and my travel weariness as she demanded every detail of my travel plans. I did not find the Concierge to be very helpful when I inquired about taxi options for local travel.There were a number of tour groups staying in the hotel. From my observation, they seemed reasonably content with the hotel.Since I had a free Sunday during my visit, my colleagues arranged a car for a visit to Agra and the Taj Mahal. Round trip from the Crowne Plaza and back, with three hours for touring and lunch in Agra, took thirteen hours total with normal Sunday highway traffic conditions.There are a number of shops in the lower lobby area of the hotel. In addition, there is a small commercial area just off the hotel property with an assortment of Indian and Western restaurants and shops of varied quality. Use your &quot;street-smarts&quot; if you venture into this area.Overall, I would stay at the Crowne Plaza again, mainly due to its convenient location near my colleagues' work location. "
crowne plaza delhi ,Don't go there - it is a waste of money The only thing which is 5star at this hotel is the price. We spent a few days at the Crowne Plaza and we really regretted it. The service is bad. Food is not good. The hotel has a problem with the air conditioning: at restaurants and in the lobby it is very cold. In the rooms it is not possible to have a normal temperature: either you switch on the AC and its cold or your switch it off and it is getting too warm.The waiters in the restaurants are slow. It takes ages till you get served (tea arrives after the breakfast is done).As said above - we cannot recommend to anybody to stay at this hotel - especially not to families with children!Generally an unpleasant place! We didn't like it at all. 
crowne plaza delhi ,"Nice hotel but good distance south of centre We stayed here on the first night of kuoni taj tour. Arrived early morning (7am) and they managed to get us in a room for half eight, which we weren't expecting. First room hadn't been serviced, but a quick call to reception got us another room. After a few hours sleep we went a wander to the local shops to go to an ATM. Its obviously an expected part of india to encounter fairly stark poverty, but it was still an eye opener. But we felt perfectly safe.There are a couple of ATMs within 5 Mins of hotel, quite handy as you can't get rupees before you go and the exchange desk at airport didn't take debit cards, only credit. Hotel will obviously change currency for you. Staff were very friendly and hotel was very modern and clean. we were obviously a bit wary of the dreaded &quot;delhi belly&quot; so we played safe and ate in the hotels indian restaurant &quot;se7en&quot;, which was excellent, lovely indian food and fairly reasonable from a western perspective. We also had a couple of drinks in the atrium bar which was lovely, if fairly quiet. A few of our fellow travellers ate at a local chinese called &quot;lotus&quot; ( i think) without any ill effects. As mentioned, you are a fair distance from india gate and connaught square, certainly not walkable, not a problem for us as we were on a escorted tour but worth bearing in mind. Overall, a good choice for delhi, would stay here again. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"haven of rest in crazy city We stayed here twice during a recent tour of India. Both times it was a welcome place to stay in a hectic city.Spacious lobby, spacious room,extremely clean and well kept.Staff was helpful, breakfast was good.I wish all the other places we stayed had been as nice and comfortable! "
crowne plaza delhi ,Very Helpful Stayed at Crowne Plaza with group of 5 girls for whom this was part of India 'experience'. Asked for and got all the help I needed in providing girls a once in a lifetime experience. They arranged day trip to Taj Mahal with meals and guides. Could not have been better. Gave us free late check out. Girls loved the gift shop in the ground floor level. Finally surprised me with complementary transport to airport on our departure. Cannnot fault the attitude of the staff in all areas. Would unreservedly recommend this hotel to any group like ours. 
crowne plaza delhi ,"Good Hotel for Delhi I have stayed in this hotel 3 times over the past 4 years, travelling on business; the last time was December 2006. I stay because of it's proximity to my businessThe rooms are clean and spacious and really what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel. I laughed when I read a recent review about the lobby smelling of Damp - it does!The smelly lobby aside the hotel restaurants on the upper and ground floors are excellent and for a simple buffet the Cafe is fineIt's a good base for travellers to Dehli, however be warned December - January is wedding season in Delhi (and probably India) and it's very busy with private functions "
crowne plaza delhi ,"The Crowne Plaza Surya Sucks On entering the grand marble lobby I was immediately struck by a very damp and unpleasant smell. This remained the case for the entire week I stayed at this hotel. I found the service in the hotel to be below average and at times was totally ignored by staff at the hotel's reception. The breakfast was very average indeed. The hotel lacks atmosphere and beware the rooms on the 1st floor, often the very rooms offered by some travel websites. These rooms are damp and the one I was offered had the carpet lifting from the damp. I asked to be moved to a room higher up in the hotel, at an additional $75 per night this was done. Definitely not worth the extra in fact a total rip off. I have been to Delhi a number of times and this was by far the worst hotel. No atmosphere and definitely not recommended. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Excellent hotel no complaints I spent 1 night at the Crowne Plaza Delhi and found the hotel in excellent condition. The double bedroom was large enough to move without problems, big bed with excellent mattress, clean sheets, room equipped with desk+chair, sideboard, armchair with table, flat-screen tv. Bathroom was, like the bedroom, spotlessly clean, no mold anywhere, great Ayurveda toiletries. Breakfast buffet offered breakfast for Asian and Western tastes (currries etc. but also bread, butter, marmelade...) Really no complaints (which you might expect from a 5-star hotel). When in Delhi I would come back to the Crowne Plaza any time. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Overall a bit pricey and not the best experience. Was clean, with an impressive lobby but the room was smallish, had old decor, and had a shakey door that needed to be repaired. There were renovations going on so the pool was out, which i was not informed about, although the gym was well equipped and modern. Management were rude to my friend when she checked in, and the post cards that i gave to the bell desk (with money) never arrived in Australia. Would not return to this hotel. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Under renovation but still enjoyed stay Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 6 weeks while on a business trip. Hotel was clean and staff friendly. Overall an excellent hotel and will be even better once renovation works are all completed, unfortunately this did mean loud noise/banging sometimes but staff always helpful and apologetic and did move me to a quieter room when possible. Nice pool area and choice of restaurants but the 24hr cafe did get a little boring as it was the only place open after work due to working to fit in with UK time. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"An Excellent Stay at the Surya We were in Delhi twice in December, and the first time we stayed at the Taj Palace, you can see my review on its hotel page, and the second time we stayed at the Surya, the reason being, one of our local friends recommended it. While the hotel itself isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace, the service is still pretty good. We had a regular room booked, but since we had a lot of luggage we mentioned that we needed a bit more space so we were upgraded to a suite for free, which was great! The suite had more than enough room, and some great features, for example, we were able to turn the shower on from the phone next to the bed, so it was nice and hot when we got in there. The location of this hotel is also excellent (much better than the Taj Palace) it is within walking distance of some great resturants, both Indian and Non-Indian, Ego Thai which is nearby was great and some of the best thai food I have had from around the world. The hotel also has a club, which wasn't that happening, but played some good music. Overall, this hotel isn't as luxurious as the Taj Palace in Delhi in terms of service, food, and comfort, but its still pretty excellent, I found them slightly more accomdating, and our suite was bigger than the one we had at the Taj Palace. More importantly, the location is fabulous, you can't go wrong with either hotel. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Very mediocre but expensive hotel Everything at the Crowne Plaza is mediocre. From the food to the rather tacky room decor to the service. The rates are rather expensive and you could stay at a much better property for the same price. I was upgraded to the Premiere Club floor but was unable to partake of the amenities and perks. I was told that I was not able to use the Club as I was upgraded. I checked and it is indeed the policy of the hotel that upgrades to the Club Floors are not welcome or able to use the Club floor facilities. I complained and explained that it is like being upgraded to a First Class seat on a flight, but not being able to have the food, service or amenities of it; being welcome to use the seat only. They gave in and told me that I could use the Club floor facilities but I felt very unwelcome and like a charity case. I booked a very expensive auyervedic massage in the spa. The spa is nothing fancy but does have a large &amp; interesting menu of auyervedic massages. My 1 hour massage was a nightmare due to the construction going on 1 floor above. I listened to pounding and jackhammers the entire time. I obviously was unable to relax and enjoy the massage and ended up more tense than before the massage. I complained and was given an apology about the construction. They did not offer to give me another massage gratis or even give me a discount. You can get much better service, decor, food and quality for the same price at many other Delhi hotels. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Good hotel Stayed there for a week, everything is nice and clean. The hotel has a nice outdoors pool and a big plus, if to avoid shopping in the center, it hosts a lot of shops selling stuff at the same prize like outside, it only needs some negotiations (like everywhere in India). The hotel has its own travelling counter, which is way too expensive, but the reception can be very helpful to book anything from outside. Don't be surprised, some of the receptionists speak/understand hardly any English, others do. The hotel is not closed to the center, but you can hire a 3 wheeled car, a tuc tuc, for 100 rupeehs per hour (don't pay more!). Transfer by local taxi to the International airport is 350 rupeehs and takes about 45min. I really recommend the location.Ana, Switzerland "
crowne plaza delhi ,Super stay I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. The hotel was in my opinion excellent. The restaurants were good and breakfast was excellent. The hotel entrance was wonderful and the rooms as one would expect from a four star hotel. Enjoy your stay 
crowne plaza delhi ,"Clean Some of the rooms are a bit dated decor-wise but I believe the hotel is in the process of under going a make over. At present I would rate it as a 4* property. The bed was really comfortable &amp; we had no problems getting a good nights sleep. The lobby/reception area is most welcoming &amp; the restaurants serve a wide variety of food. The hotel is located on the outskirts of the centre of Delhi, but as it is such a vast metropolis I would not make location an issue. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Rubbish Grubby hotel, may look like a 5 star from the photos- but when you get there, the place is grubby and in need of renovation.We booked for 7 nights but could only handle 3- we managed to get in to the Hyatt hotel - new and clean - much better and near the middle of Delhi - the Crown Plaza is miles away for anythingBook the Hyatt or the Grand, I wish we did from the start.Good Luck "
crowne plaza delhi ,"OK...but... Booked online with hotel website for 2 rooms under 1 name. When we arrived, they said they had 1 room for 2 people, and were sold out. After a few minutes of haggling, they had made a mistake in their hotel reservation system, and accomodated us. The hotel was OK, but quite far from the airport if you're just staying overnite as we were. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"A great and comfortable place to stay. The Crowne Plaza was in the heart of New Delhi, with all the hustle and bustle going on around you. However, once you were inside, it was like being in a different world.The reception was huge and dazzling.There were plenty of lifts available.The dining was exceptional with 3 or maybe 4 places to eat withing the hotel itself. The breakfast was buffet style and very good. They catered easily for my Gluten Free diet.The staff were courteous and friendly. "
crowne plaza delhi ,Awesome Staff! Nice very clean hotel. The staff at this hotel is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. I was forced into the higher price and didn’t know until check out. My husband was furious. We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted. One of the managers came to the hospital to personally speak with us and clear up the issue. I was so impressed we went back after I left the hospital. So glad! Our room was lovely. We used the travel desk and booked the nicest driver and guide for 3 days. He even took us to his home for tea! We loved this hotel. The only draw back was the main restaurant. Service was slow and food not to our liking. The Japanese restaurant was awesome! Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in New Delhi. 
crowne plaza delhi ,"Get the feel of Crowne Plaza Delhi Hi,This time I traveled with a group of friends and found this hotel in Delhi as an upmarket property to stay with. We all were booked for two nights and our stay at this hotel was an experience worth sharing about. Our Check in was done with soft drinks and warm welcome by the Reception lady, room was on the renovated floor with paintings in the corridor reflecting Indian art(impressive).Room was upto the international standards with cozy Bed and latest furnishing. Our Breakfast at Coffee shop was served by smiling and professional staff. Yes one must try the Health club which they have recently introduced with good equipments for health concious travellers.It was truly a 5 star experience in all the respect. There should be more hotels like this in every city of India.ThanksJames "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Excellent Product supported by Good personnel Hi, my name is Wilson Garry stayed between 3rd Sep 06 and 07th Sep 06. well this was my first ever vist to India I was highly worried about my trip to New Delhi. As soon I reached the hotel I was impressed by the warm and grand Lobby of the hotel,check in was prompt and welcoming, was given a room on the 2nd floor which was fresh and contemporary. Room had features like LCD screen TV, Cubicle bath ,bedside console etc.Staff was highly helpful and warm in their approach. Had my Breakfast at Le Cafe which was lavish in choice and taste.On my last night I had my Dinner at Sampan the chinese restaurant and my experience with food was ok but staff was extremly professional and knowledgeble (specially the Captain).Only thing with little sluggishness was their Travel Desk which I used for my way back to Airport and it took some 10 minutes to get the Car at the porch.Overall a good experience to be with Crowne Plaza Delhi.Thanks "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Bailed out after one night - Avoid! I booked a reservation at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi through the Holiday Inn Priority Club. I stayed at a Holiday Inn in Australia, and joined, thinking that I would accumulate points. What a mistake. The Crowne Plaza in New Delhi was probably a great hotel ten years ago, but it is showing its age. Apparently, parts of it are under renovation, and supposedly, some floors are completed. I did not see those floors. The lobby needs help. My room needed help. The room had excellent Wi Fi, and a large plasma TV, but the electrical outlets were iffy, the fixtures were cracked and fading, and the marble surfaces were showing a lot of wear. For $142 a night, I expected better. Particularly from an ostensibly five star hotel. This was just the beginning. I need to have a working electrical outlet next to the bed for some medical equipment that I use when I sleep, so it is a non-starter when the outlets do not work. The front desk sent up power adapters which blew the fuse in the outlet, (along with a young man who tried to blame my equipment, then asked me why did I not call housekeeping), then they sent up a very nice handyman who fiddled around in the ceiling with a horrifyingly antique-looking fuse box, and after some trial and error he was able to get the outlet working, but the lights in the room no longer responded to the light switches, and so they would not go out. No problem. I unscrewed all the lightbulbs so I could get some rest. Then I jumped onto the internet and booked a room at the Metropolitan Hotel Nikko. The first floor lounge restaurant offered somewhat surly help (waiter was fine, the night manager was tired, perhaps), and a very weird version of spaghetti a la carbonara. The banana shake was good, though. Oh, yeah. One other thing. The hotel neglected to send a car to meet me at the airport. I requested this when I made my reservation. I had to hire a car at DEL, which was....an adventure. I only wish that the Mandarin Hotel Group had a property in New Delhi. Trying the Hotel Nikko tomorrow. I am punching out of the Crowne Plaza, never to return. Strongly advise giving this joint a pass. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"one night review What a pleasant surprise! After reading many of the reviews on tis site I was a little anxious about staying at this hotel but I stayed here for on night with my partner using Priority Club reward points for one night (22nd May 2006). We arrived early on the morning after an overnight flight and were very pleased to be given a room at 7.30am and given an upgrade to an executive floor room on the top floor.The room was newly refurbushed with flat screen TV and well equipped. The design felt a litle unusual/old fashioned but the room was newly refurbished and clean.The executive lounge facilities were basic but ofered free internet access, a very limited breakfast and limited evening canapes and evening drinks. there is however an excelent indian restaurant in the hotel and for those seeking more western options a Mcdonalds and Dominoes Pizza round the corner.The location is not central and away from Connaught Place but we were touring and had a car and driver so this did not seem to matter.The pool was nice and my partner took advantage of of a pedicure in the hotel which was excellent value for money. The hotel was very quiet during our stay but the service was excellent and I would recommend. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"A very enjoyable stay Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 2 nights, had an excellent room on the 7th floor. It had been recently refurbished with modern amenities including a large plasma TV. The Chinese Restaurant was excellent (but not cheap), we used the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks and the food was very good. All the staff we met were very pleasant and helpful. Spent an hour sat around the outside pool area, listening the noisy Delhi traffic. We did not venture far outside of the hotel on foot as there did not seem to be much to see, apart from some American fast food restaurants. "
crowne plaza delhi ,"Better than the rest? Just spent two nights in Delhi at the Crowne Plaza. On first impressions this is a good hotel, but delve beneath the surface and you'll find a few things that definitely lower the * ranking. Most of the rooms need refurbishing and the bar area has got to be the most inhospitable place in India! Forget any intimate surroundings, this bar is in the atrium with 30 m high ceilings. The breakfast is OK, but the restaurant is far too small to cope with a full house (which is nearly always in India). The location is also well removed from downtown. I'm sure there are better places to stay in Delhi. "

ginger new delhi ,Everything awesome about it and its at a very low price Now this is what is called a great hotel at a great location with the best price. I stayed in this hotel for two days and had booked a &quot;standard room' meant for two people due to non availability of a single occupancy during booking time (i know its a waste of resource ;) ). The rooms are awesome! Very much clean. The corridors and the waiting lounge was very comfortable as well. The bathroom was good too but with no bathtub :( (It does matter to some !). It seems that the commode was meant for those people with a height &gt;6.5 feet as when you have to use it your feet cannot touch the floor. (What the heck?) The hotel has a restaurant named Comesum which is a chain of restaurants tied up with IRCTC which serves amazing food which being tasty was hygienic at the same time. The best part was its location. Its located right next to the New Delhi railway station(NDLS). So if you are coming by train you could even walk to the hotel. For local travel the metro station is again at a walking distance in fact closer than NDLS.As far as my stay was concerned I faced no problems except for they don't allow to take your car near the portico and you have to take your luggage and walk for some distance (not much). It could be bothersome when one has a lot of luggage but shouldn't be a deciding factor according to me given the security issues which the country faces.All in all my stay was good and I don't see any reason why I should give anything less than five in ratings. The negatives i mentioned shouldnt be a deciding factor as far as I believe. thanks for reading.... 
ginger new delhi ,"Best Effort by Ratan Tata for the middle class I found it extremely comfortable, very near to New Delhi Rly station travelling to the hotel by a cycle rickshow only. There is a metro entry just out side the hotel. A very good restaurant with a very reasonable price.If compared Room rent vs Cleanlilness , it will rank-1 in India. Normally the middle class cannot efford a lot of money in hotel, but desire cleanliness , a good restaurant etc, which is very well available in Zinger. It is also located extremely well convenient place. For Train Traveller, even better. Now onwards I even prefer to spend some money for this hotel to stay rather than choosing to free stay in our guest house in Noida.Thnak You Tata.Pankaj Kr Baruah "
ginger new delhi ,"best value for price Very warm and cozy rooms, plush interiors, nice service and tasty food. Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel. Best value for money "
ginger new delhi ,"Great quality for the price !! For train travelers it's PERFECTION! The quality for price cannot be beat in Delhi - for $40 you get clean rooms with satelite TV, AC, wireless (must pay but only $5 for 24 hours) and clean bathrooms - perfectly comfortable rooms. We stayed at a few other hotels for the same price range in Delhi and India and found them all to be MUCH worse. We also stayed at a few 5 star hotels which were (as expected) better but then again cost us $300 ... found Ginger to be the best bargain around.Also - we traveled around quite a bit by train using delhi as a our main hub and for this the LOCATION CANNOT BE BEAT! you are literally across the street from the train station (VERY helpful since some tickets can only be bought 2 hourse before the train leaves - if the train leaves at 5am you'll be grateful you only have to cross the street to get your 3am tickets!). Its also pretty close to Connaught Place (central Delhi) - around 2 km or INR 50 by tuck tuck (1 dollar).Good luck! mp "
ginger new delhi ,"A Clean Hotel in Dirty Delhi We had three one-night stays here as we used Delhi as a transit point for various excursions during our month-long holiday.The hotel's location, just yards from the unimaginable filth and detritus and all-round excremental disgrace that is the New Delhi Sewerage Station, I mean - New Delhi Railway Station, is undoubtedly very convenient.The large hotel is easy to see even at night time and even with luggage you can just walk across the car park that lies between the station and the hotel.With all the building work going on for the Commonwealth Games (Surely flattening the city would be a better option? After all, it’s been rebuilt several times already over the centuries!) it might look daunting to get to but walking is far quicker and cheaper than any tuk-tuk or taxi - as we found to our cost the first time we tried to get to it.We had three different rooms during our three stays and, despite reports from other contributors, we found each room clean in all respects with all the facilities you'd expect in a business hotel (albeit a budget hotel) including copious hot water.The 24-hour coffee shop / restaurant was fine - lots of well-dressed locals were even coming in for takeaways.Staff were pleasant and helpful but they won't store luggage so you'll have to use the Left Luggage Office at the station. Lock your bags and padlock them to the bays - thieves had a damn good go at attempting to break into my friend's suitcase.The hotel's location is also it's biggest problem. The AC can inevitably bring in the smells of the station but this isn't the hotel's fault, nor is the damn awful noise from the trains coming through the station whose horns even the deaf can hear! What is it with Indians and noise, anyway? Perhaps ask the hotel if it has rooms facing away from the station. Otherwise take ear (and possibly, nose) plugs.Anyway - the plus points are of the hotel's making and the minus points (apart from not storing luggage for late leavers) isn't.I would happily try other Ginger hotels. The only reason I wouldn't go back to their Delhi hotel is because it would mean my going back to Delhi. A more hellish scenario I cannot imagine. "
ginger new delhi ,"Terrible place - Avoid it!!! We booked Ginger Delhi for 2 days and left hotel with-in 2 hours of checking-in.My expectations were not great. I was looking for &quot;clean&quot; with no frills accommodation. But the room was far from being clean. There were bunch of long hairs on the floor. The hotel staff did not even check if the room was clean before handing over the room. When called housekeeping - they cleaned the room and only cleaned what we showed. After a second glance there were more bunch of hairs on the other side of the bed that the cleaner royally ignored.The walls had shoe prints. May be that previous guests wanted to make their footprints before they left. But at least I expected housekeeping to clean those marks from the wall. The quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over. When called the housekeeping to change the covers - they came with two quilt covers - one was dirty and the other was less dirty. We asked him to change the less dirty one.The hotel staff cared not to clean anything as they have enough guests who keep coming on the name of Ginger - The Taj Group.The bathroom was clean - but there was no hot water. You can fall sick if you would take cold shower in winters. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom. We had to call thrice to get the toilet paper.There was a very small window in the room and the room was damn compact. I would have appreciated if they could at least make a bigger window. That would have given the room a bigger look. Stay there only when you have no option (or may be when you just have to spend few hours) and keep your expectations level for a usual Pahargunj hotel for which you would pay not more than Rs 1000.We moved the same day to Quality Inn, Gurgaon and paid hefty amount for that hotel as it was the last minute booking but at least our stay was damn comfortable there.When complained to Ginger customer service - we only got the regret letter for the inconvenience caused and there was no refund.I would strongly advise to avoid this hotel. This is not the place where you can spend two days. "
ginger new delhi ,"Centrally Located Our journey to the Ginger Hotel didn't start too well. We booked a vehicle at the airport taxi counter. Once out of the airport our driver claimed he didn't know where the Ginger Hotel was located. We gave him a map but this didn't seem to help him. Fortunately, he could take us to the 'tourist office' who could phone Ginger for directions. The very 'helpful' man from the tourist office 'phoned' Ginger Hotel and was advised that they'd over-booked, but we could stay at their sister hotel for free! When we didn't believe this they passed the phone to us where the 'manager' apologised profusely and explained how the sister hotel was so much better. We still weren't convinced and realised it was a scam, and after we demanded that the taxi driver take us to the Ginger Hotel manager, we were given a ride to New Delhi railway station where we made our way on foot to the hotel. Of course we were immediately able to book in! When we were at the so-called 'tourist office' we saw other taxis pull up outside. The moral is that if you book a taxi from the airport then don't believe anything the driver, or anyone whose help he enlists, tells you about your hotel.The Ginger Hotel itself is quite bland but has clean rooms with comfortable beds and a TV for those who can't live without the box. They even have Wi-Fi (at a price) and there is a gym. Security is first class. There is a self-service cafeteria on site which provides exceptable food. The major downside was the booking process. We'd originally enquired about a room in August but it wasn't until 3 months later, 4 days before we were due to arrive, that the hotel was able to accept bookings. The only other problems were we were promised IT assistance when we experienced difficulties with the Wi-Fi connection, but this never arrived despite our phone calls, and there is no luggage storage facility at the hotel. "
ginger new delhi ,"Best Place To Stay In Delhi Ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India, mainly set up for business travellers, however if you are sick and tired of staying in terrible accomodation while travelling around India I would recommend paying a little extra and stay at a Ginger hotel. The Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city. The rooms are very clean, flat screen tv, air con, clean sheets, clean showers, nice staff and tea/coffee in room. Rooms have a tiny frindge which does not get very cold but otherwise well worth paying a few extra poung to stay at. I would recommend booking ahead on their web site if possible to get the best price. "
ginger new delhi ,"value for money was clean, and appeared safe. there was ample of room with clean bedding and hot water. additionally there is a good restaurant, business station and travel desk within the lodge. railway station is 5 min walk away. "
ginger new delhi ,"What a place.. I say, friends, all those of u who want cleanliness, ginger new delhi can't be ur second choice... it was so calm, peaceful and so clean that at time i felt to leave the place never. So cheap and nearby to the station it was an amazing place to live in "
ginger new delhi ,"Great place for a solo traveler This was a great place for a business trip. A spotlessly clean room, comfortable bed, bathroom and desk - plus wireless for an extra fee. I could also grab good, inexpensive food downstairs in the restaurant downstairs. Very key when I was pressed for time or needed to get something late at night and didn't feel safe heading out on my own after dark. This hotel has small rooms for 1 person which cost about half of a standard room, so perfect when traveling solo. Not great in terms of character but great if you just need a clean and safe place to sleep. If getting there by taxi, be sure to tell the driver it's by the Ajmeri Gate of the train station or they'll have a hard time finding it - and be sure to book at least a few weeks ahead of time. It books up, mostly by locals. "
ginger new delhi ,Well worth the money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The restaurant is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system. 
ginger new delhi ,"An excellent choice This is an excellent choice and great value for the price. The room and bathroom were clean, A/C was great, flat screen TV with cable, hot water (though much better in morning than night), very cheap phone calls, internet in the lobby and very helpful staff. Restaurant is ok. If you check their website, it will show it fully booked for months to come. In reality, it seems to only take reservations in the short term. Excellent location right next to the New Delhi Station. although everyone will have a tough time finding it. Tell them to go to the New Delhi Station and then ask for the Rail Yatri Niwas. If you are walking, you have to walk through a dark, crowded industrial area to get to the hotel and solo women may not feel comfortable. Otherwise, highly recommended. "
ginger new delhi ,"excellent value for Delhi Stayed one night at the beginning and one night at the end of our two week holiday. Support majority of positive comments already made about value, cleanliness and convenience. At the end of a long train journey the convenience of being able to walk to the Ginger Hotel was a great asset. The restaurant was nothing great but it's only one stop by Metro (entrance very close to the hotel) to Connaught Circus where there are plenty eating places. Would definitely stay there. "
ginger new delhi ,"Good value for the money I was quite satisfied with my stay here. I stayed here my very first 2 nights in Delhi and on the trip. The hotel is basic but clean enough. Room has complimentary water (2 bottles a day), hot water pot, TV. Right now I can't even picture the bathroom but I was fine with the room and bathroom. There are 2 computers available in the lobby for Rs 110 for 1 hr. The staff was friendly and means to be helpful. One just has to give them time. I agree with the other reviews here in terms of the value for the money.The location was great for going to Old Delhi and Connaught Circle. Also, because it is next to the railroad station, the pre-paid taxi driver from airport knew how to get to it. There is a large sign up high so once at the station you can see it. There is construction around the station and you actually need to go to the back of the station to reach the hotel.A short walk from the hotels gets you to a pre-paid stand where you can hire auto-rickshaws. There is a booking agent (of sorts) in the hotel so I used them to book a car to the airport for the next leg of my trip. I said I would take non-AC for Rs800 and I got a car with AC.One negative was trying to book a room online. I did use direct email to the Delhi Ginger hotel but they don't book much in advance and they also get full quickly.Hope this helps. "
ginger new delhi ,"Everything we wanted and nothing more! What can one get in New Delhi for 1000 rupees?The price, the location and the Tata brand were my main consideration when I booked Ginger for our 3 night stay in New Delhi. The location is amazing - bang next to the railway station. Yet so peaceful, as if away from the city.Once I got into the hotel, I didn't see a porter running towards me to pick up my baggage. Instead there were some super convenient trolleys - self-service is the mantra here.The room is not of a five-star quality but just of the right size and has everything one needs. In the common area, there is facility to iron your clothes. Amazingly designed to save costs and yet not compromise on the comfort of the stay.There is no room service, but you could pack your food from the restaurant and carry it yourself. "
ginger new delhi ,"Perfect place for family An excellent hotel strategically located with very good Customer Service. The cost of the food in the Restaurant is little higher which TATA need to relook at, as they have opened this Hotel in the Railway Station Complex and not inside/ near Airport. "
ginger new delhi ,"Can't ask for more - Real value for money Hats off to TATA for gifting us Ginger , Delhi. I booked this place after reading several reviews , but when I stayed there it exceeded my expectation. Positives : 1. Spacious and spick and span rooms for just Rs.999/night2. LCD TV3. Very neat toilet/shower4. Complementary mineral water ( 4 small bottles on daily basis)5. Centrally located - Connaught Place outer circle is hardly 1 km. CP is the best place to dine.6. 24hrs restaurant7. Water dispenser on every floor8. Very courteous staff including room service staff.These were just to name a few.Negatives :1. No auto stand in front of the hotel ( got to walk abt 50 mts)2. Restaurant not that great. They are not capable of handling more than 4 customers at a time. I had to wait for 1 hr to grab my breakfast. I suggest that you have food here only if unavoidable.3. The travel desk has very few Indica A/Cs. It has more bigger cars ,which are more expensive. Indica A/C Rs.850 / 8hrs-80kms ,but Esteem - Rs.600 more.Otherwise no complaints. I think Ginger should open similar hotels in Mumbai also.Wish you a very happy stay.Rgds,Venkatesh "

ginger new delhi ,"LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH...... We were on the way to Kerala and stayed here in a twin room. This was really a great beginning of Honeymoon. Clean and comfortable rooms with a multi-cuisine restaurant made our trip wonderful. We strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families. One of the best thing is the easy access of railway station. You can even see your train standing at platform no. 10, 11 and 12 while having west side window opening rooms. "
ginger new delhi ,"good value for money This hotel is just steps from the New Delhi train station. It has clean rooms, comfortable beds and decent bathrooms at very reasonable prices.

ginger new delhi ,"My most preferred hotel economical Ginger (Yatri Nivas) New Delhi, I recommend this hotel because its clean, the staffs are very polite, No disturbance, Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of 3 star hotel.

The metro is just a 50 meter walk from the hotel. Isn't it Great !!! "

ginger new delhi ,Noce Place But Not too Good I visited this place on my Recent visit to New Delhi. This hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard. I know this is a budget hotel but the quality is not soo good. I have also visited the Bangalore Ginger hotel but this one in Delhi is not so good. Though rooms are neat and clean but the area where this is located is not good at all. Also there is not any room service at all. So this is also a problem.

ginger new delhi ,"Fabulous hotel great location for the railway station and VFM Stayed here on 2 separate occasions during March and rate the hotel very highly. Its location is walking distance from New Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at 6 in the morning. The area around the hotel does not win any awards, in fact some parts look well dodgy, especially late at night. The hotel however has a security check point and they do actually check people coming into the hotel so no problems there. The rooms are very clean, modern looking, have a good air conditioning system, flat screen TV's, good hot showers and comfortable beds. Best of all the rooms are very inexspensive. There is a cafeteria down in the lobby area that serves various meals and drinks, the food is reasonable and good value. "

ginger new delhi ,Best hotel near New Delhi railway station I had to take a train at 3:40 AM. So I was looking for a hotel which should be at a walking distance from NDLS station. The hotels at paharganj looked shabby. But Ginger hotel (The erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas) is very nice hotel. The interiors are very good. The hotel uses latest technologies loke self check in etc. The room rates are also resonabel at around 1200 Rs. I would certainly recommed this hotel if you are looking for stay near new delhi railway station. 
ginger new delhi ,"Budget hotel in India I'm a Brazilian living in Bangalore, and May this year my family came to visit me and my wife. I planned the visit to New Delhi and Agra, so I booked on-line two double rooms. Two weeks before I called to check if the reservations were really made, luckily it was! :) Finding this hotel is complicated, and if you're a foreigner, no taxi driver will believe you know where it is (even you have a map in your hands). Tell the driver that it’s next to Pinto Road, and that he has to go through the rail station car/rickshaw’s parking area to get to the hotel.The location is pretty good to visit the sites in New Delhi.This is a budget hotel, so don’t expect any frills. You’ll find a bed, AC (little noisy), LCD TV, a desk with a small fridge and a standard western bathroom. Our towels were a little dirty and the bed sheets where smaller than the bed, even thou cleaner than some 4 star hotels I’ve stayed in Pune, Chennai and Mumbai.There’s a 24 hours restaurant in the ground floor, if you like Indian food you’re going to enjoy yourself. If you don’t you can get an auto-rickshaw for 5-10 minutes and go to Connaught Place to eat something. The hotel does have omelette and toast.The hotel does deliver what it promises, a safe and clean place to sleep. If you’re looking for some glamour try other hotels, but if you don’t want to spend money, this should prove good enough. "
ginger new delhi ,"yes yes yes! Even if it is not easy to get there (you can see it from the railway station but the road is not direct) we've found it very very worthy. Room is basic but clean, Wi-fi everywhere for 113 rupies per hour, the restaurant always open, not expensive and average quality food, just outside the door a pharmacy and a corner shop. Also a tourist desk is there, and their car rental with driver service is good and not expensive at all, compared to the others we checked. We will sure look for a Ginger hotel everywhere we'll go in India! "
ginger new delhi ,"A good base in Delhi The Ginger is cheap, clean and comfortable.The air conditioning was welcome after the May heat of the city. We tried a 4 bed family room and the 2 bed twins, both fine, the twins have better bathrooms.The 24 hour cafe downstairs was useful, not the best food ever but adequate with a fair amount of choice.Tell cab drivers you need New Delhi station, Ajmeri Gate as others have noted they often don't know where the hotel is with just the name. The surroundings aren't wonderful but it is very convenient, the metro is just outside.Would definitely base myself here again. Good for families. "
ginger new delhi ,"Budget at its best Hotel Ginger is a quality accomodation and a steal for the low prices that it offers. The fact that the building belongs to the Railways and was a Rail Yatri Niwas may have a major role to play in its pricing.But the makeover is unbelievable. Simple changes have made the hotel a great buy-in for business travellers who visit the hotel only for a good night's sleep.The rooms are very tiny but well done up. The corridors are a maze but blame it on the old building and construction.Currently accessibility from the city is a big problem because of the construction of Metro, but once that ends this hotel will be a hot favourite for people travelling by the Railways.Ginger provides option of ordering food from any local restaurant nearby and also makes available their menu cards, which is a great option if you want to choose from a variety of cuisine.All in all a value for money! "
ginger new delhi ,"excellent value for the money Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I booked four nights at the Ginger Hotel in May and was not disappointed. The hotel provides excellent value for the money. I paid more than double for the same setup at another hotel when I returned to Delhi in June. The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessman's hotel, but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance. Service is snappy and professional. While all this doesn't sound that exciting, trust me when I say that you'll be really thankful for such efficient service when you arrive at 4AM after being given the runaround by your taxi driver. The hotel is sort of hard to find. It's on the back side and across the tracks from New Delhi Station. Adjacent to the hotel is some sort of operations which involves lots of bales and carts and looks like recycling activity but is probably rail related freight operations. It's not pretty to look at, but the constant activity makes the area relatively safe, and once inside the hotel, all is nice and calm. You get courtesy bottles of water every day. There's internet access, albeit with a slow connection and expensive at 113 rupees an hour. And the restaurant isn't too bad. There's a metro very near by. If Delhi weren't so beastly hot, the hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place and Old Delhi. The place always seems to be booked, so book early. "
ginger new delhi ,"romantic rooms The hotel is magnificent . It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go anywhere. It;s ambience is so peaceful, no disturbance at all from anyone . In delhi, with such a atmosphere you can not find hotel at such a reasonable rates. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel in the price range of Rs 1000/- per day. It is in the heart of delhi hence transportation is no problem at all. ONly negative point is its' entrance through New delhi Rly station which is little crowdy, but one you in it all peaceful, neat and clean rooms with very good aesthatics "
ginger new delhi ,"Nice cute place We were scheduled to travel to Agra and planned to stop by at Delhi for a couple of business meetings. My brother was trying for hotel accomodation through the internet. He had a fancy for Ginger hotels and kept trying for a room from 1 month before our visit. He did not get one initially. But on repeated attempts, there appears to have been a cancellation and he was able to book a room.The hotel is just a stone's throw from the railway station. We flew down and took a taxi to the Station. We just walked over the platform into the hotel. We got an unbelievable price and when we walked into the hotel, the warm reception at the desk and the manners of the staff in the reception reminded us that this was a Tata hotel. Absolutely friendly, courteous and professional!When we went into the room, we saw a beautiful room with a spacious bathroom. It was an unbelievable facility for the price at this location. A tea kettle with coffee and tea packs was provided in the room.In case you get hungry, there is a restaurant in the groundfloor that offered food and beverage round the clock and we had arrived late at night without food and helped ourselves to a good tasty dinner there.A nice hotel at a very convenient place. But if you are planning to stay there, please make sure that you book a room well in advance. "
ginger new delhi ,"for young independent travellers Very clean place to sleep and have a spot in the city. Do not expect a lot. Rooms are small, claustrophobic, with single window fully covered by AC machine. Older, old-fashioned ppl are really confused when they have to deal with card locks and all those modern tools. The area around the hotel isn't too safe, quiet or clean. It is just near the New Delhi station so u can imagine all that mess around and how is it at night. But one good thing is that u have a metro station just at the corner and 24hr Comsume in it. Food isn't great but safe. "

ginger new delhi ,"Best Hotel at the Best Rate We used to visit Delhi quite often and it use to be a very difficult task to find a decent hotel at a decent price. Then the last time I was planning my trip to Delhi, I learnt that Ginger had opened in New Delhi and that to it is right next to the NEw Delhi Railway Station and so I booked Ginger. The hotel is very neat and clean and for the price I think one cannot get a better deal. They also have a restaurant, laundry service, LCD TVs in each room, etc. I think this hotel is a steal in Delhi for the price they are offering. "
ginger new delhi ,"Good value for money Good value for money. The family room contains 4 beds. With AC, pretty spacious room with LCD TV for 1000 is too good. Also proximity the New Delhi railway station is BIG plus. Now don't have to go for the infamous Pahadganj hotels.Only issue was with respect to booking. I had done day visit booking with checkin and checkout dates as same. I had some trouble (had to wait for almost 1 hour) to get the room. And the reception staff and the manager were not polite to say the least. "
ginger new delhi ,"Convenient Location A good value, conveniently located hotel next to the Metro and New Delhi Railway Station.It is located on the North East side of the Railway Station, taxi drivers might find difficulty in locating it!I had already checked it out on Google Earth and so we directed the taxi driver!The staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate.

ginger new delhi ,"if you can only find this hotel... This was one of my worst experiences!!! I finished a whole days work in delhi &amp; had to return to this hotel in the night. The arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai. I tired calling the hotel serveral times during the day to inform them that i have arrived &amp; will be checking in only later that day, only in vain as no one answered the phone all throght the day.When i left to head to the hotel we reched the new delhi railway station, but NO ONE seemed to know where this hotel was located. I tried calling them up one again. As there was no answer &amp; since it was 12:30am i began to panick &amp; called a colleague in mumbai for some assistance. He gave me the same nos to dial but again all was in vain as no one answered.After almost 1.5hrs I finally managed to ask around &amp; we got to the hotel. I was furious. As i walked in i realised that there was absoluteley no one at the front desk, the phone too was ringing after looking around the front desk executive came &amp; asked : can i help you&quot; I gave him a piece of my mind &amp; asked him what kind of a hotel do you run. This was a chain affiliated with the TATA group.i the went to my room apart frm my bad experience, this a budget hotel costing apprx 1000rs. a night. There is no room service or house keeping. You have to dine a self service restaurant. The food is similar to your meals alavailable at a food court in any mall in mumbai. The food is average for the price.If you have a low budget then this is the place for you, if you can find it!! "
ginger new delhi ,"Great hotel with excellent value We enjoyed staying at the Ginger, New Delhi.

Pre-paid auto-rickshaws are available at the New Delhi railway station which is a 3 minute walk away and the metro station is 3 minutes away as well. The only issue is that auto will drop you off a 3-5min walk away on the return since the metro work has made the entire road difficult to enter. "
ginger new delhi ,Value for money hotel Good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two. The facilities are minimal but adequate. 
ginger new delhi ,"Great Value For Money We traveled BOM-DEL by Rajdhani Express. The hotel is just oppositte the New Delhi Railway station within the station premises. Its a fine 7 storeyed building with no frills and no excellent views from hotel room. BUT it offers great value for your money.We took a family room for just INR 1000. The room had 2 window AC's, 4 single beds. The entire room was very neat and tidy. Toilets were clean. Everything worked to perfection. Any other property in New Delhi offering what this hotel offers would easily cough up 2000-3000 bucks from your pocket.Seamless check-in and check-out procedure. Nice room service. 4 bottles of mineral water and tea and coffee kits provided on a daily basis. A nice 17 inch LCD TV to take care of your entertainment needs. The quality of the beds, mattresses is very nice.The restaurant offers a very limited menu. It is something which can be improved upon. "
ginger new delhi ,Best business class hotel in Mumbai Ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for a frequent business traveler like me.They best advantage with Ginger Delhi is its location advantage.The facilities provided by the hotel are above average.I specially like the Ginger concept and now I am a fan of it.I will definitely stay with Ginger next time I am in India's capital soon. 
ginger new delhi ,love the staff commitments towards service.............. it was a gud exp.. been serviced by the ginger mgt....at the cost tat i iccured i can't even imagine a service like the one i got ..................its true to say tata as the most trustable brand of world................ 
ginger new delhi ,Decent place - low cost Decent place- reasonably clean and located next to the railway station.. Remember it is a budget hotel so a few things one should keep in minda) Carry your toiletries!b) Food is available but is in a cafeteria like place Had a few issues with them messing up over the bedsheets but was otherwise ok 
ginger new delhi ,"A Good Basic Transit Hotel A Basic Service Hotel, right next to New Delhi Railway Station , we took a 4 Bedded Family Room as were travelling with 2 Kids and wanted a Hotel Near Railway station as we were transitting next day to Goa by Flight.As we had seen Ginger in Haridwar and Goa and were impressed with the cleanliness chose this hotel.Very Nice Hotel, Location was bit bad due to Metro work on in the near vicinity , The Railway station Parcel office etc making it very noisy and dusty. But once inside it was nice.Rooms needed a little bit more care (by guests as well as by staff). On checkin found that Soap dispenser was empty and was taken away bu housekeping who forgot to replace it. The Toilet seat is installed too High making it uncomfortable. The size of the Toilet was too small. They should have selected better wc to fit the size.Linen was good, amenities Ok, size perfect, Restaurant at the Lobby level was good, economical and good.Best part is that you can go anywhere from here due to its central Location. "
ginger new delhi ,"best budget hotel in new delhi in new delhi, in area near to railway station, ginger is not only best budget hotel but with most professional management.compare to other hotels in same area with same price tag, it is the best one, all facilities like taxi, food, shopping is available nearby. "
ginger new delhi ,loved the ambience the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities.and that too economical. jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained.. 
ginger new delhi ,"Basic - but does exactly what you need for 1 night We initially booked this as we were going to be catching a train from Corbett National Park into New Delhi station (2 minute walk away). However we ended up catching a taxi from Corbett instead and our driver had all sorts of problems trying to get to the front door and ended up parking in a nearby car park! It's not in the nicest of areas, I definitely wouldn't advise walking around on your own at night.It is a standard stopover hotel, like a Travelodge or a Premier Inn in the UK. It's a pretty basic room, but has most that you need with air con, flat screen tv, tea, coffee and water. It's clean, the check in and out were simple and there's a restaurant/cafe downstairs. It's unbelievably cheap at about £14 for a night and with the money we saved here we went for drinks and dinner at The Imperial Hotel. "
ginger new delhi ,"good price what I like about this hotel is the central location, and the attractive price for room it provides.It is basic, yet, it has what you need, and it is clean enough, although they do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat "
ginger new delhi ,Well worth the Money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge. We were a party of 4 -2 adults and 2 teenagers and for 1000INR a night this was a bargain. Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV. The resteraunt is open 24hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive. Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only 2 mins away by foot. Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them (Connaught Place 5mins) which are available just outside the hotel. There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great. All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after 9pm this is a highly recommended hotel. The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is . It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system. 
ginger new delhi ,Decent The hotel is decent &amp; as per Ginger standards. The rooms are good&amp; clean. Its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station or arives these late at night. On the negative side its in the congested &amp; poluted area of station &amp; u cant step out for a snack or stroll if u desire. 
ginger new delhi ,"Inexpensive but know what you're getting into My friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money. It came highly recommended by my friend's coworkers in Bombay. However, we ended up not staying there. On the drive there, our driver muttered in Hindi that 'cheaters go there'. Then, as we waited to check in, the fellow customers, all men, started casually inching closer to my friends and me. We were a group of 3 20-something women, and two of us are white. While we may very well have been perfectly fine, it would have been nice to know about the area and clientele before we booked the room. Later in the week, my friend reconnected with a friend from Delhi who told us it's located in the Red Light district. That reaffirmed our choice to return to Claridges.Couples, men, families - I'm sure it's a great deal. Women traveling without male companions... it might be prudent to stay elsewhere. "
ginger new delhi ,Good Place Good place for a 2-3 days leisure time. The room service was quick and the food was satisfactory. The rooms were neat &amp; clean.I would recommend to the viewers to stay at this place. 
ginger new delhi ,"Purely Smart Basics !! Loved my stay here. Hotel is clean &amp; proper. Has a good restaurant as well.Rooms are self sufficient, though small if you are looking at spending more than 3 days here.Staff is extremely helpful.Located right in the Delhi Railway Station premise, so good for Train travellers. At the same time, it's away from the hustle-bustle of the train travellers at the station.However, the entrance is a little dificult to locate the 1st time around. Entrance way is crowded as well, if coming via car.Also, if you are a very light sleeper, then the Honking of the night train can disturb you. But less likely. I slept like a LOG !!General store cum Medical store in Hotel complex is fully equipped, and is priced at MRP.Overall good experience for a one-2 nite stay for work. "
ginger new delhi ,"Great value and excellent location Ginger was just what we needed for the final 3 nights of our 3 1/2 week stay in India.It was basically an Indian travelodge, so don't bother staying if you want an authentic heritage experience, but the room was immaculate (by western standards rather than Indian) and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities, TV, comfy bed, AC, etc.The location just outside New Delhi station was perfect for arriving/departing via the station, within walking distance of Paharganj and Connaught place, and a short metro ride to Old Delhi's main attractions (Red Fort, mosque, etc.) The 24 hour restaurant came in handy for our day trip to Agra and early morning flight back to London - staff at reception were also happy to ring for a metered cab to the airport when the travel desk in the foyer tried to charge us 1200Rs to get to the airport!At 990Rs a night, this was slightly expensive than other hotels we stayed in in India but worth every penny. "
ginger new delhi ,"Excellent value but a bit of a nightmare outside It's an Indian TravelLodge. So excellent value for money, good clean room with a/c and good clean bathroom but basic decor and a bit echoey in the corridors. The restaurant / snack bar is good (try the plain dosa). It is a short trundle across the car park and through a little gateway from New Delhi railway station. You can't leave your luggage before / after check-in but there's a rather forbidding left luggage place in the station. The hotel has a perimeter fence and a security guard. Immediately outside, you're in a horrendous noisy tide of hand carts, jeeps, motorbikes etc - or you can hit lucky and find it pretty quiet. Getting in is OK if the taxi knows the circuitous route to the entrance. Otherwise, they'll drop you right by the building and it is quite a challenge to find the way in. Expensive internet. "
ginger new delhi ,"Very nice and clean hotel but the restaurant Very nice clean hotel with good room facilities, good location just at Ajmeri gate 100m from NDRS and metro, nice stuff - willing to fully refund one mine canceled night, but also sometimes act too bureaucratically. Hotel restaurant is a different story. It works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu. Same with fruit salad. "
ginger new delhi ,"Exceptional value in a big city! We stayed for two nights early March and then again a week later. Both times the rooms were immaculate, we stayed in a double room costing just 999 rupees per night, the rooms are equipped with Satellite TV, kettle, tea and coffee, fridge, celan bathroom with shower curtain, these are a rarity in India! We had a problem with our toliet on the second visit but maintenance were at the door almost as soon as we had put the phone down from calling reception, and the problem was rectified.The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from New Delhi station which makes it perfect for early morning train journeys. We too had a problem with a taxi driver not knowing where the hotel was, but we also had a tuk-tuk driver who didn't know where Connaught Place was?!?!? The staff in the hotel are really helpful and work really hard to keep everyone happy, they even called Domino's pizza for us as we were having trouble with their pay phone. "
ginger new delhi ,"Value hotel in a good location Good value hotel, Clean rooms very close to the train station. good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney. "
ginger new delhi ,"Absolute value for money no frills located right next to Railway station A Compact small room with wooden flooring, clean bathroom, with a telephone, air-conditioner and a cupboard with hangers was all for Rs 999. A standard room means a Queen side double bed, whereas a twin bed room are two separate beds. There is also a category with four beds at the same price if there are more people! The rooms are small, and one could compare this with Ibis in Europe, only that dust in India makes it harder to keep the property as clean. But no complaints.There is a restaurant at the ground floor (Comesum) which serves decent food options. The location is excellent, next to the Railway station and to Connaught place, N Delhi. When we stayed, there was lots of metro rail construction happening around the hotel which made access slightly round-about. However, we could walk to the railway station early morning strolling our bags on our own (there are baggage strolleys available in the hotel restricted till the main entrance of the hotel) in about 7 minutes.The laundry service was reasonable and prompt - deposit in the morning and receipt by evening 8 pm.We booked online and check was easy too. There is a helpful reception desk. The hotel is quite busy due to the price and location, and one needs to bear with that.Overall, a comfortable and convenient stay. "
ginger new delhi ,"good value for Rs 1200 I stayed here once alone and once with my wife in January 2009 for Rs 1200. Overall a good hotel but there is a problem in getting taxi drivers to find it. Most don’t recognize the address whether spoken or written down. But I eventually go there on every ride, with perhaps a ten minute delay. It is a forty-five minute car ride to and from the airports, don’t use a rickshaw. Rooms were Spartan but spotless on both visits. The lobby was slightly less clean yet more than adequate for a quick stop over in Delhi. The restaurant had reasonable food and prices (Rs 60-100/entrée), but the menu was limited during any given meal. "
ginger new delhi ,"Ginger Hotel Our stay at the Ginger Hotel was great. Forget expensive bed and breakfast hotels, the Ginger Hotel is a no frills, and a great hotel. Our family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms as the family room (1000INR) was totally booked. We stayed in a double and 2 singles rooms (1000INR each) for 3 days. We arrived at the hotel which is located next to the NDLS railway station. It was chaotic outside. We approached the hotel gates, security didn't let the car through (security check), we got off, and headed towards the lobby. Check in was a bit of pain as Indians don't understand getting in line to get attention. We were soon given our room keys and went upstairs. We but our bags in the trolly. THe rooms were clean, and had the basic necessities. 4 water bottles inside the room. Heater and AC were part of the room w/ remote control. TV was LCD. Internet was expensive but we didn't care as we were at the hotel to only catch night sleep. THe floor consisted of an iron table in the hallway. THe hotel at the lobby is superb. Order watever you want as they are open 24 hrs, indian/chineses/western and is clean. We ate dinner here every night as we were sure not to get sick. THe hotel also has a gym and meeting room. Newspaper free at lobby. No outside noise was noticibly. Pick this hotel if you want a inexpensive 3.5 star service. It's centrally located to all monuments, and shopping areas are a taxi drive away. Since it's located near the train statin catching a taxi/or a 3 wheeler was a breeze. Walk outside the gate and towards the train station, there you will find an office for the 3 wheelers. Tell them where you want to go and you will prepay your trip. No negotiating. For taxi, the black taxis are outside too but here you have to talk to the drivers. We took a taxi to the airport for 400INR but all intercity trip to visitor monuments/shopping were done in tuktuk (3 wheelers). Would I stay here? In a heartbeat. Save the money and use that on shopping. You are on vacation and will use the bed for only night 8 hrs of sleep anyway. I spent 3500INR for a bed and breakfast hotel on the last stay which was pathetic (house of lords), spend the money at Ginger. Make sure you prebook online if you want the Family room (4 ppl for 1000INR) as it's in HOT demand. We couldn't get the deal so we took the regular rooms for 2 at 1000INR each which is still great. Staff is super friendly, will go out of the way to help. They've even got a ground transportation group at the lobby but I thought they were expensive. A medical store exists in the lobby as well. Request a room in the higher floors for a greater view. See pics of the location. This is a gem in the city no doubt. Coming into a foreign country from the US is a headache but staying at Ginger will calm the situation a LOT. "
ginger new delhi ,"Great value for Money Stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in January 2009 with friends. There were 3 of us, so we got the Family room which has 4 beds for Rs.1000/nightThe stay was comfortable and just what it advertised itself as - a no frills hotel. Though service at the hotel was good, there were areas for improvement. 1. The hotel provides only 2 towels in a room meant for 4 persons and you need to ask them for extra towels. The towels could be of better quality - they shed threads which stuck all over!2. Wifi/Internet access is expensive at Rs.130/hour compared to internet rates elsewhere3. The room key card repeatedly stopped working and meant a trip to the lobby each time to fix it!On the positive side,The staff was very polite and helpful. The 24 hour cafe is convenient, especially when you need to leave at odd hours of the night. The food wasn't bad either :)Having a metro station at your doorstep is really usefulThe beds were very comfortable or maybe I was just really tired. The location of the hotel near the New Delhi Railway Station and Metro station is convenient BUT it also means that road access to the hotel can be confusing, as it is in an area surrounded by a parking lot and a railway parcel area.Overall, if you aren't going to spend a lot of time in your hotel room and just need a comfortable, safe and clean place to spend the night Ginger is the place for you, but don't expect a full service hotel. There are still a few kinks they need to iron out but the helpful staff fixes any problems quickly.I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Delhi. "
ginger new delhi ,Good Hotel Hotel was good and neat and clean. As I presume they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well. I guess they can modify those a bit. The toilets and the bath does not have any buckets or mugs. If you have a kid you are in for some trouble with that. No room service or bell boys are there. Not a bad choice for a stay next to NDLS station 
ginger new delhi ,"Great value for a family of 4 We stayed in 12/2008 twice for 2 nights each in a family room which sleeps 4. The first time the room was not very cléan - but the second time it was. Great location - great price (INR 1000 per night). If you check in later or check out earlier they automatically give you a reimbursement. The surrounding area is not recommended to go for a walk.Due to heavy construction work and proximity to the railway station it does get loud if you wish to keep the window open. There are however 2 A/Cs in the family room and 2 fans.The 24 hour restaurant in the basement is OK - its clean and has a wide variety of dishes: southindian, north indian, even blackforest cherry cake ;-)The car rental service in the hotel is however a rip-off. Book your transport elsewhere. Staff is friendly and helpful. You can also get your clothes washed there. Internet access works most of the time. "
ginger new delhi ,"Nice enough close to New Delhi railway station We pre-booked a room in Ginger hotel for our first night in Delhi. The taxi driver had serious problems to get to the hotel as the hotel is next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station. However, he got us there and we were greeted by the friendly staff. Our room on the 5th floor wasn't that spacious but nice. Clean sheets, flatscreen TV and complimentary bottles of water as well as teabags and coffee. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest we have ever seen but good enough. As we were leaving for Rajasthan, we decided to spend one more night a week later. We asked the front desk staff upon checkout about making a reservation for that night. They said that there were rooms available. However, they could not make the reservation - we had to do it through the Ginger website... To use their internet access, we would have to pay more than a 100 rs for a wireless card. (1 hour costs about 35-40 rs at any internet café in town)The next time we came to Delhi, we found out that the metro is extremely close to the hotel, about 25 metres from the hotel gate. There is however no metro sign so you have to ask the guard to show you the direction. Ginger hotel is also very close to the railway station which is convenient for early morning departures but also causes noice at night. The hotel isn't five-star but for the price, it's definitely recommended! "
ginger new delhi ,"RESERVATION NOT HONORED- left stranded My friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didn't honor her reservation. They had record of the reservation but there were no rooms available. It's the middle of the night, her first trip to India and I'm here in the US desperately trying to google some kind of alternative. So...BE CAREFUL. Double check that they are ready for you. Otherwise it's a great place to stay. "
ginger new delhi ,"Great value for money with few kinks As an NRI family from USA, including 2 teenagers , and traveling in India for the first time, we were a little apprehensive about our Indian travel agent's recommendation re this hotel. However, overall experience for our 2 rooms over 5 nights turned out to be excellent . We checked in at 3AM on 12/19 and checked out on 12/24 without any problems. They gave us partial credit for the 1st night, which was a pleasant surprise. Access to the hotel is cumbersome, but since we had hired a private car with a driver, this was not a problem for us.Best things were front desk svc, 24hr restaurant (cheap, lots of variety, mild food, good svc), laundry svc, cleanliness, uninterrupted hot and cold running water, free water bottles, free tea &amp; coffee, and access to a safe. We did not miss not having room service. Although the family room does have 4 beds, it is very small and quickly got congested with all our baggage. So our decision to book 2 rooms, and have access 2 bathrooms and extra space turned out be a good one. The biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc; e.g. some days we got only 1-2 towels or no TP for 4 people; one day no svc at all. They always fixed the problem promptly upon complaining, but it did not have to be this way. The only other issue was night time noise at the Rlwy Stn, which we drowned out by running the A/c fan without the A/c. Also, WiFi broke the 2nd day and never got fixed, even though they said it would be fixed within a couple of hours - a problem not unique to Ginger, but commonly encountered in India.If you want a 5 star hotel, Ginger is not for you. But I would definitely recommend this hotel to any family that wants basic modern value for money. "
ginger new delhi ,"Good value for money and good location Stayed at the Ginger New Delhi, mainly because of the location - it was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it.Overall, it was really good value for money, clean hotel and friendly staff.ROOM - room was an adequate size, wooden flooring and clean. The bathroom was a wet room but I found the toilet was a little high - such that when you were sat on the loo, your legs wouldn't touch the floor :-)The complimentary water provided in the room was really good and a nice touch.SERVICE - there was a restaurant bolted next door to the hotel with access from the hotel which served food which was great as it meant we didn't have to start hunting around for breakfast.LOCATION - it was very conveniently positioned which was handy as we were catching the 0615 train to Agra so we just had to hop out of bed, and walk to the train. The location meant that you could hear the station announcements and was noisy at times, but we were in a city after all, so noise was expected. Ear plugs are something I now carry with me at all times!OTHER - there was a little room which had complimentary water, iron and ironing board, and newspapers which was nice to have.COST - very good value for money - can't fault this hotel on this!Overall, I would definitely stay again, great little hotel, clean, good value for money - what more to do need! By no means was it the Ritz but it was functional - just what we needed! "
ginger new delhi ,"A good value hotel in Delhi I choose this hotel after extensive research of hotels in Delhi.The thing that finally swung it for me, was that is was cheap.The selection of hotels in Delhi swings from the cheap to the ridiclious.The Ginger seemed to be a hotel that served the purpose of being a safe,clean bed for a couple of nights.We flew in from Goa, for a couple of days of sightseeing, a day trip to Agra and then onward to Jaipur.This hotel was adequate for that purpose.The good points were, clean rooms, serviced daily, on site 24hrs cafe, close to the new delhi railway station, great for catching the shatbadi express at 06.15 to AgraThe bad points, the construction work of the metro makes the area chaos, a taxi ride from anywhere else, you over look an interesting area!, expensive wi-fiConclusion: If you want a good value, clean hotel in Delhi, the Ginger hotel is a good option "
ginger new delhi ,"Value for Money Surprisingly Rooms at Ginger Hotel was available for the dates that I was traveling to New Delhi. it was an hazel to reach the hotel, with all the construction work going on around it, and its location near the station gave jitters. All these was only till we reached to the hotel. The people at the reception were friendly and the room, pretty clean and tidy. Could not say it was big, but was sufficient for 2 persons. The only point of concern was the food at comesum restaurant housed inside, the food was just edible! though the live music at the restaurant was pretty good.Overall the hotel is complete value for money "
ginger new delhi ,"Excellent Value This is the best value hotel I've ever been to. Its thoroughly modern, with all the basic facilities (including payed Wi-Fi at rooms). The location is good too, with Metro station right outside, and one metro stop away from Connaught Place (i.e., 5 minutes). Also, its easily booked online. The downsides - the shower area is a bit small, and the beds are very light (which can be a bad thing if you want them to stay put). Its also quite busy just outside, due to the railway station (Indian Railways, not the metro). There is no room service, though the affordable 24 hour restaurant Comesum is decent. "
ginger new delhi ,best thing about the hotel is self service .. loved the ambience i have recently gone through a very fantastic service in the hotel industry in india..the service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi..the system of help yourself is catching up fast in india and much to my delight the price of the hotel is fair enough to shell my wallet. 
ginger new delhi ,Leisure at very low cost I usually go on my bussiness trip to New Delhi. I prefer to stay in in Ginger Hotel. It has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have . Moreover easy to check In. Good Bed and superb guest service 
ginger new delhi ,"Excellent Value for money Excellent value for money.. Neat and clean. Within the New Delhi Station, hence a great choice for people travelling to or from there. There is a 24 hour medical shop and a vending machine for those late night hunger pangs. All of this for less than a thousand bucks !! "
ginger new delhi ,"Superb! Best choice at New Delhi Train Station We have been there in Sept 2008.It is directly located at New Delhi Train Station.Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around 1000Rs. Reservation by internet or phone. TV, a/C, 24h warm water, clean linen. "
ginger new delhi ,Excellent Deal.. No one could imagine such an excellent stay at the heart of New Delhi.I stayed for 4 Nights. The room was perfectly Clean. I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi againThe Price was the great attraction. It cost just 1000 rupees. But It gave the facilities &amp; comfort of 4000 Rs room. Superb.. Real Value for Money 
ginger new delhi ,"More than Value for Money. This is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger and Tata Group also owns the Taj 5* Hotels in India &amp; Abroad.An existing 7 Floors Rail Yatri Niwas which was managed by Indian Railways has been handed over to Ginger Hotels to run the Buget Hotels and it has been refurbished completely and opened in August 2008. With the Hotel Pricing at 1000-1200 for AC Room with LCD TV, Mini Regrigerator with small but neat and clean rooms you cant ask anything more. The biggest surprise was even a 4 Bedded Family Room also was priced at Rs. 1000 with Two AC's. They have WIFI Zone, Mini Gym, 24hrs Restaurant, Vending Machine and also a 24hr Pharmacy Center within the complex. I had seen around 15-20 International Tourists staying at this place. The Rooms are with Dark Shades with basic interiors and Hot &amp; Cold Water. No Room Service is provided and they manage with few staff and thats where they are able to cut down the costs. However compared to other Ginger Hotels this one is priced at much lower rate I guess it could be because of the agreement with Indian Railways because they have provided the Land &amp; Building. "

grand godwin hotel ,"Grand hotel indeed! *Grand Godwin is a fantastic hotel, such great value for money.*Our first night was in a Super delux, as our room was not ready. It had a hairdryer and fridge and was slightly bigger than the delux we had for the rest of our stay. It also had a blocked off window so it was really quiet. The delux was road side and a lot noisier.*The beds were fairly comfortable and the rooms were very clean.*The restaurant is 24 hr and the food is great. Good breakfast too.*Godwin in central location between old Delhi and Connaught place so easy to get around.*One of my favorite hotel's on my India trip. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Awful service from managment Stayed there last year when Delhi was the first stop on the India trip and I wanted to make sure that we had a reservation somewhere before we arrived. The rooms were OK, not splendid (relatively clean, though). Substantially overpriced, however, compared to those in hotels on the same street (including those with larger, nicer, cleaner, rooms). We were there for several days, so re-negotiated the price after the first day based on comps, but then the management did not honor that when we checked out. I am Indian, but grew up in the US, and my travel partner was American, so not sure if this was because of tourist gouging or just horrible service. Anyway, if you make any agreements on price, make sure you (a) get them in writing and (b) have management sign off immediately, or you're screwed. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Comfort and Location Stayed at the Grand for one night on our way through Delhi to Udaipur. Have stayed here before for longer stays. Our room was comfortable and clean, check-in was quick and easy, and Wi-Fi is available. The roof-top restaurant offeres an expansive breakfast. If you've never traveled in Asia the neighborhood can be disconcerting at first. But the Grand is an easy 10 or 15 minute wald to the train station, and a quick tuk tuk ride to Connaught Place for some shopping. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Good hotel Good hotel in a nice area, near metro station and interesting spots. Especially having breakfast at the roof top in the morning is really nice. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Decent value I enjoyed my 3 day stay here. Room service was very kind, food was excellent and the room was clean. It's centrally located and in an interesting area of Delhi. Only negative is that I had constant trouble with Internet (they gave me my fee back). "
grand godwin hotel ,"Probably the best hotel in Pahar Ganj An excellent choice near New Delhi Station. We first stayed one night in room 402 at the beginning of our tour of India. Very clean, large and comfortable room. Very good breakfast. At the end of our tour of India, we first stayed one night at Jyoti Mahal Guest House which we left because it was dirty and we went back to Grand Godwin Hotel for 2 nights in room 207 which was a little smaller than room 402 but as clean and comfortable as room 402. Price of the room : INR 2,812.50 per night breakfast included. It is true that the neighbourhood is noisy but in the hotel, it is very quiet. They have a taxi service to the airport which we used. Good service (price: INR 350 for a non AC car for a drop off at the airport). No doubt for us : the best hotel in Pahar Ganj. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Ok-ish We had a semi deluxe room; we had booked it on their website a month in advance. We arrived late at night and it took a while for them to find our booking confirmation. The room wasn't too bad, by no means spotless, the usual peeling paint etc but it was pretty clean compared to some of the dives we had previously stayed in India. The restaurant was OK and b'fast an interesting buffet affair but not awful. "
grand godwin hotel ,"surprisingly nice Ok, when you get there, you are, at first sight of the neighborhood, quite...frightened. Don't be: get off your car, make it through the crowd, the dirt, the unpleasant smells, the COWS, the motorcycles and the rickshaws and let the doorman open the door of a peaceful all-in-white-marble lobby. Service is efficient (god they are ALWAYS cleaning for real!), rooms are not too small, when they say triple rooms they actually mean THREE beds (which is not so common in 3-stars-indian-hotels as i discovered), AC is working just fine. No view. Funny elevator.Breakfast is not very good (don't bother trying to get something else thant a Nescafé in 90% of indian restaurants&amp;hotels), but you can get eggs, fruit juice,tea, toasts etc no problem. I would advice to give it a try to the roof-top restaurant, non-expensive and tasty(try the Biryani, the best i've ever had). Don't forget to ask them NON SPICY, it will still have enough of flavor. "
grand godwin hotel ,BAD SERVICE I made a reservation weeks before arriving in Delhi and specifically asked for a driver to pick me up because it was my first time in India. They sent me a confirmation with booking and pick up driver but upon arrival on the airport nobody was there. 
grand godwin hotel ,"a popular choice in the area This is the best and also the most popular hotel in the area. The main reason lead us to book there in the first place is so we can catch the early train to Agra, and late train back from Jaipur. Other than that location does not matter so much as Delhi's landmarks are quite spreadout, you would need to get a car from places to places no matter where you stay. The hotel travel desk can arrange a sedan for a very reasonable price. We take full adavntage of that, and used cars for three days to save the hassles of negotiation everytime getting into a local transportation. Overall, we are quite pleased with our stay. The room is decent, but bathroom could be better equipped to avoid the floor getting wet so easily. The roof top resturant is not bad, the breakfast was better than we expected (as we read bad review about it before we went), and dinner is even better. "
grand godwin hotel ,"bad dirty, shaky, shady and old.... absolutely inadequate for most travellers. perhaps ok for some very low budget low demand backpackers and some locals....we left it on the second day to find another hotel and fortunately Incredible India guys helped us greatly with rearranging hotels for us in different cities. It was especially great to have them help us in the middle of the night, when we arrived from the airport first day. Note that initially whole trip was planned by myself without any help from them or other tourist agency. I ran into them at night, when looking for the hotel and they helped. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Terribly dirty and tricksters The bedroom was terrible, very dirty and we found some cockroaches in the bathroom.The receptionist was a trickster, we booked it in advanced paying and they didn't keep our reservation, when we arrived in the evening we found that our room was sold and they tried to give as a lower category room for the same price, after one hour of argument we got the room we had booked.The breakfast wasn't good. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Grand Nightmare wow, I am writing this from the lobby of the hotel unable to sleep because of the infernal noise from constructions going on in front of the hotel and my room. What an awful place! Stay away at any cost. When I arrived, my reservation wasn't honored. However, they offered me a &quot;better room&quot; for the first night. They don't actually have the room they offer and want to make you pay extra. Given the roon isn't really expensive it is not much , but the attitude behind that makes you feel not welcome at all. Well, I won't pay extra...They don not appreciate your business. The place is located in the slum areas around Delhi central station. Exiting and interesting! I'll be looking for another hotel tomorrow, don't waste your time here. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Poor - not nearly as good as the website/reviews made out As per other reviews, at booking it promised a free airport transfer. After informing the hotel of our pickup time, car didnt' arrive, called up and was told that we had to pay extra and that the car would be with us in 45mins if we were willing to wait - forcing us to get our own taxi and make our own way there.Area around the hotel is utlra poor. True this is where the budget hotels are but it's pretty dire, no pavements on the roads, did not feel safe even though we were a group of three. Was promised internet access in the rooms for 50rupees per night, only to find that internet actually only works on the ground floor in the lobby, so anytime I had to use it I had to sit in a lobby full of ppl to use - not what I had in mind. Rooms are ok size, there is no bath just a wet room shower, and it's clean. Breakfast on the roof top is poor, only the omlette or cereal is worth eating, the milk had congealed fat in it. Coffee is instant coffee that you make yourselves. Travel desk - gave us a taxi which had a dodgy driver, took us to too many places (bazaars without asking, fake government travel agents that we didn't want to go, in the end we had to send him away - no refunds tho. Overall the interior of the hotel is clean, but location, breakfast and staff service terrible. Don't trust the staff too much. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Well sited Although located in a street full of hotels, the Grand Godwin is different from most of the others in that the attractiveness of the lobby/reception follows in the rooms. Many of the hotels have a nice lobby but the rooms are not so nice. The Grand Godwin has perfectly fine rooms, although the bathrooms are a little compact. Not a problem if you don't mind the water from the shower going all over the bathroom. I guess they don't mind cleaning it up! It's well located for convenience to New Delhi train station..great if you intend to travel around India by train. The area around isn't much to look at but then again, it's only 5 mins from the Metro (5 mins from there to Connaught Square or Chandni Chowk etc). The restaurant is basic but we didn't use it apart from breakfast time. The inclusive breakfast is limited but adequate to stave off the morning pangs of hunger. The staff are pleasant and helpful and internet access reasonabely priced. It's an ok place to stay and your stay is unlikely to gave rise to any complaint. The price is a little on the high side though. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Mixed bag Generally great... clean, smart, good location but.. generally little niggles.Firstly the food (especially breakfast) is utterly dire. breakfast is a buffet set up and was cold and generally quite disgusting. You are better off trying to get a discount by getting a room without breakfast. Evening meals meanwhle are overpriced and nothing special, you are better off going out to eat.Our delux room was extremely comfortable and easily the cleanest place we stayed in India, but had no window and had an annoying dripping tap.i found the service to be good.One thing, and I am being pedantic but... laundry is overpriced and then it all comes back with a number written in marker pen on each individual piece that even now, 6 weeks later refuses to come off. It was also late coming back, turned up with extra items that I sent back.. and was promptly charged for anway. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Surprisingly nice hotel After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, I was a bit hesitant to book this hotel. But it was surprisingly nice, and the staff were very helpful. Our room was clean and modern, as were the lobby and the elevator. We stayed there twice, and both times the hotel arranged taxis to the airport that were reasonably priced and worked well. The restaurant was quite good (for breakfast and dinner), and open 24 hours, which was great because we arrived very late at night. Our room faced the street and was rather noisy, but that's hard to avoid in Delhi.The hotel is located in the Paharganj section of Delhi, and walking the streets of Pharganj is quite an experience. The sidewalks are very narrow and often covered with street vendors, so it is usually necessary to walk in the street, with heavy traffic consisting of autorickshaws, trucks, cars, motorcycles, cows, bicycles, and pedestrians. We also stayed at the Prem Sagar Guest House in the Connaught Place section of Delhi (and I just posted a review of that property). Connaught Place is much fancier than Paharganj, with wide sidewalks, Western clothing stores, and easy access to the Metro. But the Grand Godwin was a much nicer hotel than Prem Sagar at a significantly lower price, and the Paharganj experience seemed more like the &quot;real India&quot;, so I would definitely recommend Grand Godwin over Prem Sagar for anyone who needs a place to stay in Delhi. "
grand godwin hotel ,"unprofessional and unhelpful staff It the damaging for me when i was arrived in India. I booked the hotel , they inform me your pickup is free at the time booking. But there is no taxi for me at airport in midnight. When I reach the hotel. Guy behind the front desk was sleeping. Next day I book the taxi for Delhi sightseeing hotel book the taxi. He charged very high price to me 50USD. Breakfast quality is very bad. They charge me the room rent also high 1800INR + 22.5 Tax for one day. I check the room rent out side of this hotel was 800INR double and single with breakfast. 50% paid to touts and autoriksha drivers. I can't recommend to any single lady, couple, senior citizen to stay this hotel "
grand godwin hotel ,"Amazing hotel! Okay, so the hotel lacks a little character, but it is extremely clean and well equipped. However, the overall package is what impresses me the most. The staff are attentive and courteous, and when I had a problem with a scammer who stole my money (a crook that sold dodgy airline tickets) they went out of their way to help me. The General Manager is a saint and even when dealing with this from the UK, he is always there to answer questions and he truly has been doing all he can to help me in this situation. They seem to really care about what tourists think of their country, and have been quite disgusted by the behaviour of this individual. I really cannot speak more highly about this place, and will always recommend it. In an expensive city like Delhi, it also very good value, too. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Great value hotel The hotel is conveniently located about 2 minutes by tuktuk from the train station. I chose this hotel because I needed to catch a few train from the Dehli Train Station. The staff arranged airport pickups for us twice, and they were always there waiting for us. they were firendly and attentive. They also arranged a tour and a pick up at the Agra train station, and it was well worth it. The rooms were clean as well as all the bed sheets, and comfortable. The hotel is located on a popular street were there are other hotels. They have room service, internet access for a small fee, and included breakfast. I'd recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a place next to tre train station. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Impressed My partner and I stayed at Hotel Grand Godwin just a few nights ago during a holiday in India. The hotel was lovely, very grand and beautifully decorated. We opted for the deluxe (rather than semi-deluxe room) for 2400 rps a night including tax and breakfast. Our room was great - clean, comfortable and cooled with a vert quiet AC system. The staff were friendly and efficient, booking an airport taxi for us and arranging for breakfast in our room at 4:30 am before our flight! Although the hotel says the breakfast is 'continental' it included much more than croissants and coffee. They had cereal, fruit, an egg station as well as a full range of Indian dishes. At 9:30am, when my partner and I hadn't shown up for breakfast yet, a member of staff came to our room to check we were okay! We had one evening there meal which was also good, a little pricey compared to elsewhere, but tasty. The hotel's location is fab, on a busy street in Parhaganj, about a 3-4 minute walk from the train station and from the main bazaar street. As with most Delhi hotels, it wasn't quiet at night - you could hear people out on the street outside, but it wasn't so bad that you couldn't get to and stay asleep at night. Overall, very impressed. "
grand godwin hotel ,"A good hotel in a good location We stayed at the Hotel Grand Godwin at the beginning and end of a three week trip to India. We were really impressed with the hotel it was well located, the rooms were a good size and clean and the breakfast served at the roof top restaurant was particulary good. The hotel is a 10/15 min walk from the main bazar or a 20 rupee cycle rickshaw ride and a 10 mins walk from the train station, an auto rickshaw ride to Connaught Place is approx 50 rupees. We used the hotel taxi service to collect us and take us back to the airport and we found the staff really helpful. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Very clean and good price Very clean hotel room I found in New Delhi with Fare price. The staffs of the hotel, specially the front office are very helpful. All kinds of Delicious Indian foods are available. We had wonderful friendly service. My room is only US$45 per night with break first. Hot water is available. A/C and big TV worked my room. Secure airport transfers and sight visit tour arranged by the hotel. Only the thing is surrounding of the hotel is too crowded during my stay. "
grand godwin hotel ,"A super find in the heart of Paharganj This place is a clean, friendly oasis from the teeming madness outside. All the staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms and linens very clean. A 'super deluxe' was 2500Rs per night and I had a big room with tiled floor, TV, coffee making stuff and an ensuite. It was a bit noisy outside, but it did quieten down a bit at bed time, but this wasn't a huge problem once the ear plugs were in place... The breakfast buffet on the roof terrace was fine although I didn't sample the evening cuisine which was available. There was an internet connection available on the ground floor, a travel desk who organised a taxi for me at a reasonable cost and an exchange desk. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Connaught Circus along a straight road under the flyover that carries DB Gupta Road and is also round the corner from the Main Bazaar with internet cafes, small shops and cheaper hotels and guest houses. "
grand godwin hotel ,Budget hotel not very clean I booked this hotel on recommendations from other reviews. I am a bit surprised at the reviews that give a 3 to 5 star rating. I have traveled extensively and can say that this hotel does not deserve anything more than a 2. Stayed 3 nights and the biggest problem was the cleanliness of the room and in particular the linens. I read in previous reviews of others stating the same. The bedding on both beds had many stains and soiled areas and seems to have not been washed; bathroom was also less than adequately clean. I had a room on the back side of the hotel only to be kept up all night by barking dogs; they moved us the following day to a room that had no window. Another concern (as also in other reviews) was the fact that upon check-out I also experience the front desk asking for more money although this room was prepaid including taxes. I firmly stated I would not pay and they backed off. Location is desirable for good access to Delhi train station. 
grand godwin hotel ,"Comfortable well run hotel convenient for New Delhi Station We stayed three times at this hotel in October/November 2008 using Delhi as our hub to explore northern India. The hotel's airport transfer is expensive, much better to use the pre-paid taxi stand at the airport (you learn this after the first time).The noisy /dirty side street location of the hotel is a bit off putting, but inside it is clean and comfortable and efficiently run. Do not confuse this hotel with the Godwin Hotel next door which is truly awful but run surprisingly by the same owners. We were informed that it is due to be demolished and rebult in 2009. The rooftop restaurant of the Grand Godwin is clean , nice staff and the food good. The included buffet style breakfast was very good. Rooms are well furnished , hot water and aircon all worked as did the cable TV (some rooms have wide screen).There is free wireless internet in the hotel lobby or you can use the hotel computers for a small charge. Best of all, it is a 50 rupee auto-rickshaw ride (5-10 mins depending on time of day) to the New Delhi train station and not too far from Connaught Place.The hotel gets booked out so best to book ahead if you can.All in all a good place to stay and fair value by Delhi standards. "
grand godwin hotel ,Good for Price We arrived at 3 am and after battling with a pre-paid taxi driver who suddenly couldn't find the hotel arrived with the [--]. They had us sorted and in our room. We didn't much like it so next day requested to change and did so to a front street facing room which was fantastic. The breaky was great and hearty and the restaurant even served pretty good dishes for lunch. The location is the only issue. If your female expect heaps of hassles and expect heaps of poverty. My partner was never comfortable walking the streets at night and so we only travelled by autorickshaw. If I went again I wouldn't stay in Old Delhi... and that's coming from someone who always likes to stay in the guts of things. They organised us a driver for a day at a reasonable rate. Expect to tip at this hotel. Many hotels have communal tipping jars which is better.. pain in the ** to have to constantly stick your hand in your pocket and to have to scrounge for small notes with this in mind.It was a lovely hotel and clean.. very clean. I still would recommend it though. Pretty good value for $. 
grand godwin hotel ,"Safe landing spot to get over culture shock Reserving mid-range to budget hotels is rough in India, but we managed to book through laborious direct email process (bring print out to prove payment, you're likely to need it). Aside from normal odd Indian stuff, this relatively bargain hotel is fine. Delhi is a shocking, dirty din at first, so this hotel was a nice safe haven for us. The rooms were clean, bathroom okay (Indian budget bathrooms you take your chances), nice people working there, and a good spiral staircase is I think where the &quot;Grand&quot; part comes in...anyway, we stayed a second time when we passed through Delhi again for a night, so there you go. Indian breakfast buffets not my favorite thing, but this one was as good as any we've had so far. Hotel Grand Godwin isn't a place you'd stay too long, but just fine for arrival and regrouping a couple of days, or a stopover. We aren't the youthful backpacker types and we did well enough here. It won't do if your the oBeroi/Taj kind of traveler, but otherwise, go ahead and stay here. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Great service at the Grand Godwin Our time in Delhi would have been miserable if we had not stayed at the Grand Godwin hotel. Our room and the service were really good. The breakfast on the rooftop restauant was fantastic. No other hotel I've stayed at in India does breakfast like the Grand Godwin.Our room was serviced daily and we also had a newspaper delivered every morning.The travel desk was helpful and able to sort out travel to Agra and back. We opted to hire a driver for Agra and were really glad we did this. No hassle at a reasonable price. We also hired a driver for the day to take us to Delhi fort, the Crafts museum and Santushti shopping mall.The hotel is at a good location. We were able to walk to Connaught Place to shop at Fabindia and the official Cottage Industries shop and beyond. You really didn't need a rickshaw or taxi for this. Just keep walking down the road! "
grand godwin hotel ,"threw out my reservation Don't bother making a booking. If the hotel is full, they'll give away your room to anyone walking in off the street. You can confirm your booking, tell them when you will arrive, leave a copy of your passport, do everything they ask and they still will not hold your room for you.I watched them give away a room 5 mins (!) after a guest booked it - in person - while he was down the street getting his luggage!At the hotel next door they told me this happens several times a day, every day.The staff at the GG reception is positively useless. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Very good hotel even more so for the money Great hotel to stay at, in the less touristy part of paharganj but does not suffer from it.The roof top bar is good too.Rooms clean, beds comfy.Will be going back to this hotel when I return to delhi. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Perfect locations Great location very close to New Delhi train station which was perfect for an early morning train journey to Agra or anywhere else. The hotel is on a street that runs parallel with the main bazaar but isn’t directly on it. The main bazaar street is the centre of Paharaganj and is where a lot of the guest houses, bars and restaurants are. Only takes a few minutes to walk there but quite nice to go back to your hotel to escape from it. Location great as a good base for the first visit to Delhi and could easily get a rickshaw to sights.The main bazaar has great shopping for your typical traveller - short/long trousers which lots of European women travellers wore and a really good buy, bags, incense sticks with loads of other things. If you’ve been to Thailand then this is the closest thing to Khao San Road. More hectic as is all of India and less bars but the closest thing in Delhi. There’s also the most amazing jewellery shop that’s the best in everywhere we went in India. It’s like an Aladdin’s cave and I could have stayed for hours.You can also buy the Indian bangles that are everywhere. There’s a lady that sits in the fork in the road and she has some great colours for about 30 rupees for 15. There are quite a lot of places to eat and drink but we found that if you trust the lonely planet you cannot go wrong. We ate first at a bar called The Gem Bar on the straight part of the main bazaar. The staff were really friendly and the food was OK but as the book says we would recommend this more for a drink rather than an eating place. Again following the book’s advice gets you a good restaurant and the Metropolis is a great choice. It’s also a hotel and from what we could see it looked OK to stay and was our second choice if we couldn’t stay at Grand Godwin. Nice rooftop restaurant and the butter chicken was lovely. Again it’s a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the street.The Grand Godwin hotel includes breakfast and the freshly cooked omelettes are a good start to the day. The hotel will look after your valuables behind reception which is handy and they do change money but there’s another place down a side road opposite that does a better rate. There’s a TV in the room (not that you need it), a hot shower and the standard room and perfectly big enough.Would recommend it for anyone on their first visit and especially for the station. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Surprisingly good accomodations in New Delhi During our month-long journey through India, we were in New Delhi on 3 separate occasions. It's unfortunate we did not discover the Grand Godwin until our last stay. For starters, the hotel is a short walk to the New Delhi train station. It is also a short autorickshaw ride to many New Delhi sites such as India Gate, C.P., and museums. The rates are good, the rooms are clean, and if I remember correctly they offer complimentary breakfast.All in all, one of the better values in New Delhi!! "
grand godwin hotel ,"Ejoyed our stay at the Grand Godwin We booked one night at the Grand Godwin, our first night in India as well as the airport taxi. (which was worth it). If our experience was good and there was no &quot;extras&quot; charged by the staff we would book 3 more nights after two days in Agra. Our experience at the Godwin was good, even great and we are very glad that we stayed 3 more nights after Agra. This hotel seems to be really trying to teach their staff about service and what a western tourist might be used to. The more you engage their staff, the more they are friendly and try to help. The rooms are nice and include wide screen tv's. The breakfast is delightful on top of the roof and all other meals we had there were good as well. Dehli is one crazy and intense city but staying at the Grand Godwin was a delightful experience. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Okay hotel but you get what you pay for.... We just returned from a trip around India and stayed at the Hotel Grand Godwin for 4 days. The room was clean and nice but I'd be hard pushed to recommend it.We stayed in room 203 (no windows) and were constantly woken by the noise of other people showering in their rooms (noise came through the air conditioning shaf above our bed).When we went to leave (at 6am), the hotel staff tried to charge us an additional fee, saying we owed a luxury tax. We showed them our email receipt as we had booked through their website (which clearly stated our online payment was inclusive of all taxes) and they still continued to demand an extra $40 in rupees. It took them about 20 minutes to begrudgingly agree that we had actually paid everything.This really left a sour taste in our mouth and we can only imagine that they try this trick on most people in the hope of getting extra cash. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Really great hotel in paharganj close to everything We went to India for a wedding and stayed in Delhi in the Grand Godwin before and after. For almost all of it, I am quite satisfied with the place. The rates are great and the staff (most but not all) are friendly and helpful and gracious. You may experience difficulty when you make an arrangement with one person currently on duty and then face another person on duty the next day/later in the day who has no idea of the arrangements and refuses to accept it. Perhaps ask for things in writing, signed.Nevertheless, the hotel is wonderful. Their travel desk, though probably more expensive than hacking it yourself, is worthwhile when you consider the &quot;hassle factor&quot; e.g. getting off at a train station and being mobbed by touts/taxi drivers/etc. The place is clean, the rooms are wonderful and the bathrooms are very good with hot water. The food is really good and the breakfast buffet is totally worth is. I would advise anybody going to Delhi to stay in Grand Godwin. We saw some Indian people staying there as well so obviously locals also consider it worthwhile.It's well placed in that it is within walking distance of the New Delhi train station as well as the New Delhi Metro. If you're up for it, rather walk there than get a rickshaw/taxi as they'll charge you tourist rates to go really close. You can catch the Metro to many major places and even Karol Bagh and Connaught Place (shopping). The Metro is really very nice and worth using to travel around Delhi (though not in rush hour and watch out for pick pockets). Some areas are not yet serviced by the Metro but it is ever expanding.We had only 2 incidents worth moaning about at the hotel. We were three in a room and one of us was leaving at 8am for their earlier flight. The bathroom door became stuck and she couldn't get out. Eventually we had 5 guys from the hotel in the room trying to get the door open (it was 10 minutes before her taxi was arriving to take her to the airport). They realised the urgency and broke the door down. However, the rest of us only left at 4pm and there was obviously a shift change and the new guys apparently didn't know anything about the door. We had gone off in our taxi when they phoned the driver and asked him to bring us back to the hotel to answer for the broken door. They wanted us to pay. After some &quot;heated discussion&quot;, someone relayed the information that the door had become stuck and that we weren't at fault.Also, a small tip, try and avoid the number 3 room on each floor (103,203,etc) as this is directly across from the supply closet where the staff member on duty (any of them) will noisily spend his time playing cell phone games, chatting loudly to other staff, packing and cleaning, at all hours of the day and night.Nice benefits: the plug with multiple types cell chargers already installed in case you forgot/misplaced your charger; aircon; hot water; free cold sealed mini-waters on arrival; nice tv with loads of channels; room service any time of the day or night; travel desk. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Rooms are clean but organisation Hotel is ok but the team is a very big problem. If the manager is not there it's not possible to find a solution. Twice we had to pay more that was agreed. If we didn't we have missed our planes.Whatever is your agreement on the prices, even by mail, they finally oblige you to pay the standard prices. As people at the reception change regulary during the day, you never meet the people you dealt withI met people at the reception that was upset because they have booked on the net, but reception didn't book the rooms. And the hotel was full ... One day There was a girl arriving at midnight, she had to find an other hotel, despite her booking ! "
grand godwin hotel ,"Very good hotel We arrived to Delhi and took a pre-paid taxi for 200rps, we had a little argue with the driver as he was very rough with us, so I didn´t give him any tip and he wanted to hit me........ you will notice that the people generally is very rough in Delhi. We apparently book a luxury room at this hotel for 50 euros a night so the gave us a suite and I the room was so good, a room that you can find in a 4 stars hotel in europe, with plasma tv and etc... I saw the standard one and is nothing to do with the luxury one, so I recommend you to book the luxury one for 10 or 15 euros more, you won´t regret. The room was very clean and the hotel installations very good. The restaurant small but good food, and the serve a buffet breakfast very good. They also have a travel agent who can arrange you a pre-paid taxi or any other thing you need for a reasonable price. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, close to cannaught place and the railway station.The only negative thing is that when was the time to check-out and pay, the recepcionist told me that the credit card machine didn´t work, who I didn´t believe, so as we didn´t have enough ruppies to pay the bill we had to pay in euros, with this transaction they rise the original price because the exchange, so I think they are use to do this with the foreigns to make more money, so if that happens to you tell them that you have no other way to pay and force them to use their credit card machine, what I should have done in that ocasion.If you take a train to any other place, once you buy the ticket and go straight to the platform to wait for the train, do not show the ticket to anybody who ask you to see the ticket because there are so many cheaters who seem to work at the station but they will try to take you to a travel agency to sell you a new ticket just by telling you that your ticket is not valid, Do not believe them, just wait for the train to be called and get in. It is incredible that in India as you are a tourist everybody will try to rip you off, so be carefull and have a look on the travel blogs to see the experiences and taxi fares of the other people who have been already. "
grand godwin hotel ,"A pleasant Surprise Long but helpful review.I have been to Delhi on a number of occasions for my personal business and on each visit, I have tried to find a new hotel that meets the following formula: best hotel + cheapest rates. Now this, for those who have been to Delhi, or any part of India, know is virtually impossible. Hotels in India are VERY expensive. A 2-Star hotel in Toronto (that's where I am from) would be classified as a 4-Star in Delhi, with the price of a 5-Star in Toronto. So when I hear or read other reviews from people who have not been to any part of India and expect so much, I can't help but smile. So here is my advise to everyone from N.America or UK or Australia or NZ or any first world country: don't expect too much.....even if you have to dish out $200/night. Don't expect the hotel that you will have booked your room in to be like one of the hotels in Toronto or Chicago or Auckland or Melbourne. Unless of course, you are willing to pay about $400-500/night. Having said that, you could get lucky, as I did on my last trip to Delhi last month (May 2008).On my previous trip to Delhi in December 2007, I stayed at the Mehga Sheraton in Karol Bagh. Apparently, the owner of this hotel (Naresh) owns two other hotels not far from each other: the Mehga Sheraton, the Madonna and third hotel I cannot remember. The Madonna is the &quot;top-of-the-line' from all three with rooms at about Rs.5000/night (US$ 110.00 @Rs.45 a $). The Megha Sheraton that I stayed at was around Rs. 3300.00 The room was small, the bathroom smelly, the couch stained and lots of noise. And, get this, the site advertises &quot;Free internet&quot;. But you have to go to the Madonna hotel to use the internet, the one I was staying at does not have it. So anyhow, on my last trip to Delhi, I found this gem of a hotel. The Grand Godwin (or maybe it's the The Godwin Grand). Now again, don't compare this to a hotel in a first world city. But for the price of Rs. 1800 (US$ 40.00), this hotel was twice as nice as the Megha Sheraton and lest than half the price! Finally, I had found a gem. The bathroom was clean, the room was spacious, the service excellent, the hotel itself (rooms, lobby) very clean. And it had wireless internet that actually worked! The hotel also has a sister hotel, The Godwin, located right next to it in the Pahar Ganj area. The Pahar Ganj area itself is not very clean. Its crowded, congested and smelly. But because I was out most of the day and in my hotel at night, it didn't really bother me. The New Delhi Railway Station is about a 5 minute WALK from the hotel. Connaught Place (locally known as CP) is a downtown core with plenty of shopping and restaurants and is about 5 minutes auto-rickshaw ride from the hotel. For those people who are on a budget, I strongly suggest you check this hotel out.A few tips about travel to India.1. DO NOT trust information about hotels on their websites. Most of the time, it is misleading. For eg. the Internet scenario at the Mehga Sheraton on my Dec. 07 trip.2. Most hotel managers (not all) will smile, bend over backwards for you and while doing that, will empty out your pockets. Be smart and ALWAYS negotiate.3. When planning a stay in a Delhi hotel (or any hotel in India) NEVER book through any online consolidators (Expedia, Travelocity, etc) even if it is a few dollars cheaper. You have to pay in advance for the number of days that you will be staying and should you not be happy with the hotel after your first night, you are stuck! And recovering any money would be a nightmare, if not impossible. Best thing is to get the tel. number of the hotel, call them and book a room for 1 night. Try it out and if you don't like it, you can change the hotel. Of course, the risk with that is they may not have rooms available for more than one night. But if you are travelling during off-peak months, you should be alright. Some of these hotels, when booking, will ask for your credit card info. I normally don't give it out and almost always pay by cash.4. Peak months in Delhi: November to February. Pleasant weather. Between May and September, it is very hot and generally off-peak months. During these months, you can most likely negotiate room rates.5. Most hotels charge about 12% tax on hotel rooms. Be sure to ask if the rate you are being quoted includes tax.6. Ask questions. If you are told &quot;there is Internet connection&quot;, ask if the Internet is in the same hotel that you are staying. If they say they offer wireless internet, ask if it works. I am saying this from experience.7. Be polite to the locals. They work very hard and are very poor. They have less than 10% of what we have in N.America or other developed countries. Negotiate with them (for eg. the rickshaw people with cycles who transport you) for the best price. But then when you arrive at your destination, give them a little more. Many times I had travelled by these rickshaws and see them sweat as they work their way through traffic and in the heat. I normally give them about Rs. 50 more than what they had asked for. And the look in their eyes, the gratitude they display just melts my heart. For me, that Rs. 50 is fractionally more than a dollar but for him, it will feed his entire family for that evening. Be generous, at the same time, be wise.8. Finally, go to India with a totally different frame of mind. Don't expect things there to work as efficiently as in your own city. When things don't go right (and believe me, there will be many times when they won't) bear it, tolerate it and laugh it off. When you say &quot;well...back home things are done this way or that way or this fast&quot;, you will end up having the most miserable time of your life. India is India! Period. End of Story. Be open minded and enjoy. It took me a long time to figure this out. Earlier when I used to go to Delhi, I'd want to come back back to Toronto after 3 days! During my last trip, I went to India with a different frame of mind and enjoyed my stay. Or perhaps it was the euphoria I experienced when I found the right hotel (?)Anyhow, hope this has helped, and enjoy your trip. I will be going back in October 08 if anyone is planning a trip to Delhi around that time wants to hook up. "
grand godwin hotel ,"A clean well-maintained hotel with reasonable rates At last! a clean, well-maintained hotel in Delhi with reasonable rates. After 5 weeks of travelling through India, it was so comforting to find clean linen and a well-maintained hotel where everything actually works! The hotel is on a busy street close to New Delhi Railway Station, but the rooms are quiet. Booking was a breeze with the excellent website. I paid $35 for a single including breakfast. Strongly recommended. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Adequate rooms poor service The room was reasonably clean but not free of the occasional scurrying cockroach. The hot water facilities were pathetic but otherwise the bathrooms were clean and functional. The room service was a consistent problem; I had to call to get the room cleaned. The night staff at the reception were rude and ill-trained. My offense apparently had been to check out at 6:00 AM and thus trouble their normally scheduled program of doing nothing. It should've been Monthy Pythonesque funny, except it wasn't. Word of advice: establish your superiority in the pecking order quickly and firmly, else the staff will be inclined to take you for a ride. The over-friendly tourist is an exploited tourist. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Great hotel w/ wonderful restaurant We stayed at the Grand Godwin, not the Grand Godwin Deluxe.This hotel is a great value. The hotel lobby is snazzy w/ marble and a glass elevator. The room (single, Deluxe) was on the smaller side but was clean and nice. The bathroom also was clean. It has fast internet in the lobby. The restaurant on the top floor surprised us because it had really wonderful food and I think we had our best meal of India there! Altogether, a great value. I paid $42 for the night. It was very, very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place to people who are looking for a good mid-range hotel. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Good location A block away from the Ajanta where we had stayed at the start of our tour, we decided to try this place on our way through Delhi to the South. Modern bedrooms and helpful staff. The 2000rps cost included a good breakfast, but not an airport pick-up. There is a taxi service desk in the lobby.Good value for money "
grand godwin hotel ,"Good hotel Excellent Value What a good stay. It is really difficult to find a well priced reasonable hotel in Delhi. 5 stars go for $400+ and all the rest just have very mixed reviews. Of all the hotels this looked like the best on trip advisorand was also mentioned in Lonley Planet.They did not disapoint. The hotel cost $50 for two for the night, so brilliant value. The hotel was clean, very nicely appointed and service good. We were in room 309, a little noisy (but we slept fine) from the street, but we wanted to look out. Just ask for a room on the side if you need very quite sleeping time.Great location, between new and Old Delhi, right next to Connaught Place and New Delhi station.We also booked a driver for the day through the hotel and it was excellent value rs650 for the day, 8hrs or 80km.Breakfast was fair with a nice selection was offered on the roof. (no views)Bathrooms and shower all in one but worked well, and this seems to be common in India.If you are looking for nice hotel and are not wanting to pay much this hotel will deliver far more than you expect.Staff were friendly (except for reception).Auto rickshaw to Connaught pace will be about rs100. I think this was too much but out off all the places in India you need to watch out in Delhi. Just set a price before you leave and if you are comfortable with it, it may not be worth the argument for an extra few cents off when you convert back. Much better than I expected "
grand godwin hotel ,"Bad experience This hotel will aggressively try to sell you as many things as it can in terms of guided tours, etc. The lobby is nice enough - and that's all they show you on their website. The room was dingy and smelled. When I asked about going to Agra, the hotel tried to book an exensive guide/driver and would not give me directions to the Delhi train station as an alternative - because there was no commission in it for them. They also said no trains were available - which was a lie. I was promised an early breakfast because I had an early check out and was not given the breakfast. There were other problems and the staff was unpleasant to deal with. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Watch for bait Nice and clean hotel but do not prepay! They raised our rate when we got there although we paid a month before arriving with a credit card through their website. They gave us an 'employee room', not the superior room we booked until we paid an additional amount. While we were there every night there were travellers at the reception yelling at the front desk managers because they were asking for additional money vs. the prepaid amount so this seems to be standard practice for this hotel. The staff is not friendly and not accommodating although this scam goes against all international hotel reservation rules. Even when you show them their internet printed receipt and E-mails they won't give you a room until you pay an additional amount. This is too bad because otherwise it's a nice hotel. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Decent hotel in Delhi We had travelled to India on a previous trip and stayed in the same area, Pahar Ganj. This is the rundown, cheap traveller area and a bit of a shock if you haven't been to India before. However, the area was safe to walk around and a convenient location.We arrived late at night and were quickly checked in and brought to our room, a couple of minutes later we were called by the front desk and they had given us the super deluxe room instead of the deluxe we had booked and paid for. They said we could move the next day. After a great nights rest and breakfast at the hotel we had our bags ready to move, but our new room wasn't ready and we wanted to go sightseeing. The hotel had no problem with us staying in the superdeluxe room until later that day. Overall the rooms (both the deluxe and superdeluxe) were a great size, with clean bathrooms. The staff was very helpful and always pleasant. I recommended this to other travellers later in our trip and they stayed and enjoyed their stay as well. "
grand godwin hotel ,"good choice in Delhi This hotel was quite a good experience for us. It is certainly not fancy but more than adequate. The rooms were clean and the hotel staff were organized and helped us with our travel arrangements. We found accomadation in delhi to be either too expensive or cheap and got very strong negative reviews. This place is close to the train station which is handy and had good food at the restaurant. They picked us up from the airport our first night there which was great and had all our train tickets and flights booked and ready for us the following morning. We made prior arrangements which saves alot of hassel especially if you are short on time, everything books up fast so plan ahead either on your own or through a good agent. In all honesty Delhi is not a place where you will spend alot of time. Its a big dirty city with alot of noise and poverty however this hotel for us was a good place to stay while in transit to other places. We stayed in both regular rooms and a suite for one night. There is litle if any difference between them so opt for the cheaper rooms as you will probably not be staying long and its really not worth the extra expense. The area is close to a tourist market which is okay and there is some restaurants there. If you are choosing to stay for more than a day or two you may want a nicer place closer to tourist spots but for a day or two its a good choice for exploring and transit through delhi. "
grand godwin hotel ,Dingy hotel Room was very dark and dingy with only one window that lead to a concrete wall. we also had a guy outside our room all of the time who kept spitting. try to avoid as they clearly don't clean the sheets 
grand godwin hotel ,"Only with Caution..... We booked to stay here 12th October 2007 on our first night in India, then again for the 20th - 22nd October 2007 for our last 2 nights.We were picked up at the airport on the 12th October at gone midnight, and fair play to the driver, he waited a good while for us because our plane was delayed.The check in procedure is a bit lengthy, but we eventually got checked in and taken to our room. Room seemed clean on first inspection, but arriving at that time of night, we didnt really have much choice. The sheets to the bed however were really disgustingly dirty, but we'd thought ahead and brought our own sheets and pillow cases.Our real problem with this hotel came with our &quot;CONFIRMED BOOKING&quot; for the last two nights of our holiday. I called to check the reservation, after hearing of other peoples hotel problems, and was told that we had no booking, that they had never heard of us and that we had never previously stayed at that hotel. Which was news to us!!!The chap on reception told us (rudely) that there were no rooms free, but if we came to the hotel there might be (this we didnt understand at all). I asked for the reservation manager, who is the only person apparantly who could use the computer system, to call me and explain what was going on. Needless to say, he never called, and we found somewhere else to stay!Incase you're interested the other place we stayed at was a b and b in the Defence Colony and it was really good - orchidretreat-bednbreakfast.com.So if you are planning on staying here, bring your own sheets, check your booking several times and dont be surprised if they deny you exist ! "
grand godwin hotel ,"Rude and unprofessional staff I tried to check in to the hotel but encountered unprofessional, discourteous and rude staff at the front desk. I was asked for a picture ID and I gave my international driver's license. The hotel manager sent it outside the building to get a photo copy. I waited for over 20 minutes to get back my license. Meanwhile, I paid the advance for the room and my personal details were entered in the hotel register. When there was no sign of the hotel staff returning with my license, I was told that the license will be delivered to my room and I could now check in. But I insisted that I get my license back before I move in to the room since I did not want to take any chances with it. At that point the hotel manager told me rudely that my ID was not good enough and wanted a copy of my passport. I was told that his name was Joginder Sharma. I expressed surprise at his behaviour and called for his supervisor who apologized and offered to help me check in. But Joginder Sharma kept on arguing that he has to follow the rules of the hotel. I asked him why he accepted my driver's license for an ID if he needed the passport and he did not have an answer. Needless to say, I refused and moved to another hotel. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Ok My friend and I stayed in a &quot;suite&quot;. The room we were given had no window. We asked to be moved to a room with a window, which was only granted the next day. Both &quot;suites&quot; were clean and fairly spacious. The showers were open (no door/curtain). The toilets were a bit dirty but ok. You generally have to lower your standards when staying in India. Breakfast was served on a roof terrace. The selection was modest but tasty. The hotel provided cheap Internet access. Beware when checking out: I paid with Visa card and I was told that I had to pay a fee for using the card. I refused and in the end I did not have to pay the fees. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Great Hotel Review prepared by two senior citizen couples that have traveled extensively in the far east and limited their hotel cost to between $20 and $40 US per room per night. Stayed in this hotel on two occasions for one night each at a cost of $42 per night per room including breakfast. Found hotel to be excellent. Rooms were clean, of sufficient size, central air conditioning and heat, central hot water, and met all our expectations of a hotel in the city. Bathroom was fully adequate. Breakfast buffet on roof was adequate but not extraordinary. Hotel personnel were friendly, courteous and very professional. Hotel is located near New Delhi train station on a street that has an estimated 30 hotels. The Grand Godwin appeared to be the one of the newest and best. Ten minute taxi from Connaught Plaza. Recommend hotel highly and will stay there on next trip to Delhi. Hotel has own website and recommend booking directly through it. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Beware the pubic hairs!! We originally stayed in this hotel for a few nights in Jan after being recommended to it by a couple we met at another establishment. They had pre-warned us that the sheets, although apparently cleaned, did have some mysterious stains - as if they'd been stored on a floor, and that was certainly the case. However, having seen and heard many horror stories about Delhi hotels we figured that wasn't too bad, and at least the showers were hot, it was conveniently located to New Delhi station and breakfast was included (even if it was fairly ropey!). So we decided to book it for our last night in Delhi before we flew back to the UK. Well, that was a mistake. First they claimed that they had no deluxe rooms booked - even though they'd confirmed our booking via email only 2 days before - and tried to charge us for the a Super Deluxe room. When we refused and pointed to where they'd handwritten the correct room booking in their reservation book, they agreed to charge us the rate we wanted - which was lucky because Super Deluxe and Deluxe are exactly the same! Sheets were revolting - covered in pubic hairs and clearly not laundered in between guests. We demanded they replace all the bedding and towels, but even then the sheets were still covered in hairs. It was all so gross I barely slept. At 1500 rupees it's not a cheap hotel for Delhi so I would definitely recommend NOT staying here, EVER! "
grand godwin hotel ,"good value We arrived early morning to Delhi and a lift from the airport was arranged via the hotel (good idea especially if you come for the first time to India). We had no problems to get a room immediately (but double check at the reception the check out time to avoid paying extra). The room was fine, perhaps not up to European standards (good cleaning could help). Staff was rather helpful. The best was the restaurant: quite cheap and really good (the most important: no problems whatsoever afterwards).As regards location, it is only two minutes walk from the Grand Bazar and the New Delhi train station and certainly the street is slightly less crowded that the Grand Bazar. Overall it was not a bad choice, especially compared to other hotels in the area. "
grand godwin hotel ,"Average Hotel Our stay at the Grand Godwin was simply average. Its located in the back street of Delhi and looks like a &quot;dodggy&quot; neighborhood. Only the day manager in the front desk seems to be helpful, the others don't seem to speak or understand english. Their travel desk is too expensive. Avoid using them if you can. The rooms are clean but the washroom do not have bath tubs or proper shower areas. If you are looking for clean washroom, DO NOT stay here. Its quite basic but cheap. "
grand godwin hotel ,"OK Hotel Can dDo Worse and Can Do Better Currently staying at the Grand Godwin Hotel until 4th Feb 2006. Booked directly after finding their home page.The hotel is situated in the back streets of the Paharhganj district of Delhi.As the reviewer from Canada has stated they d have internet acces but i have just been informed that they charge 25 Rupees per hour and not free as he has stated or as it states on their card.Service in general is ok. Loads of touts once you set foot outside the hotel doors. They also have a Travel and tourism desk but the bloke who runs it seems a bit of a dodgy character. We paid 550 Rupees each (2 of us) for a tour of Agra, Mathura and Brindravan. Sure that we could have got it cheaper.So much to write about but not enough time.Rooms are ok but the Super Deluxe rooms dont have fridges and so you can't chill your drinks etc. "
grand godwin hotel ,"best value This small, friendly, cheap, clean hotel is by far the best option I found in Delhi in the 3-star range. Conveniently located next to the train station, it's the perfect place to stop while traveling through Delhi. They have an internet connection that doesn't work superbly well but is free. And you can make cheap phone calls abroad. The restaurant is very decent. "

grand sartaj hotel ,"Hasan M. Abu-Narr Abu Dhabi UAE Excellent Hotel and Brilliant Staff with reasonable price ... I stay in the hotel from 20 – 21 August 2009. I came to New Delhi to do a professional exam at Ramnath House Yousuf Sarai Community Center. All staff was very helpful and cooperative … especially the receptionist. I would like to thank Mr. Prithive (receptionist) for his help and advises. Many thanks. Hasan M. Abu NarrAbu Dhabi , UAE "
grand sartaj hotel ,"Excellent Staff. Very Courteous. Accommodative. Careless Owner. I am very pleased with the staff. Staff is very courteous. The owner/management is lucky to have such a wonderful staff. It is not enough to have good staff. The owner/management should have good outlook and try to improve the condtions. Air Conditioning is not adequate, Staff maintains the rooms and bath rooms to their ability. But the owner/management should care to update the fixtures. Any bath tub or commode will go bad inspite of regular maintenance. It has to be replaced at one point. Similarly the Air Conditioning. If the owner/management can wake up and replace the old fixtures with new once at least oncer a year, this hotel can get more than 4 stars. But for now this is a 3 star or less.I give 200% credit to the staff. The restaurant is good. The staff in the restaurant is excellent. This hotel was arranged for us by GetsHolidays.Breakfast is included. We had to leave the hotel early morning by 6:00 AM to go to places twice during our stay. Since we went from US, we were only trusting the food at the hotel and were affraid to buy any thing on our way (in Dhaba etc). We requested the kitchen staff to pack some breakfast for us. They did an excellent job by packing toast, jam, muffin and fruit. I really appreciate the efforts taken by the staff to pack the breakfast in such a neat manner for us. Even though the hotel is away from the central Delhi, it is in a quite neighbourhood. Close to Delhi IIT and AIIMS.Since we were there in July the weather was un bearable. It was very hot and once we go out we sweat. Even though we travel in an air conditioned car, once you step out you sweat. We had vacate the room by noon. But requested the staff to allow us to take shower once we came back to pick up our luggage that we left in their cloak room. They were kind enough to allow us to take shower before we left for the Air Port.Overall this is a nice hotel and I would not hesitate to go back again. I would highly recommend the hotel to others. "
grand sartaj hotel ,"Very Good I stayed here for almost a week while attending a conference in the same hotel.Found the place quite good in terms of the rooms, amenities, facilities like the restaurant and conference setup. Large rooms and a great buffet in the restaurants were definite plus points.One negative factor is that the place was a little bit far from for example the city centre. Otherwise it was good. "
grand sartaj hotel ,Value for Money We wre around 18 doctors stayed in Grand sartaj . execlent Hospiltality given by staff neat n clean place to stay at reasonble price. Food was execlent . Parking a little problem. Good Interior . 
grand sartaj hotel ,"Dirty and overpriced We stayed at this hotel for one night, out 1st night in Delhi, it was a horrible experience.It is close to a main road, but not within walking distance to anywhere, very noisy all night!Bugs in the room.The breakfast was terrible and overpriced.We were booked at this hotel for another night after our tour and our last night in India, we did not stay here as we couldn't bring ourselves to enter this hotel again. "
hans plaza ,"extremely helpful Our first stop in India, looks nothing but comfortable rooms and well sited for shops and sights. The staff couldn't do enough for us, we left our safe open in the room while we went for breakfast and the boy making up the beds drew it to our attention when he could have easily helped himself. Also when my husband was struck with Delhi belly, pretty inevitable, they immediately let us have our room for another night and made all the phonecalls to tourguide, taxi etc. for me which was a great relief to me. Very clean so I don't think he caught it there. Restaurant a bit pricey but some european food on the menu. "
hans plaza ,"Don't Do It When our car pulled up it appeared to be an abandoned parking lot. The outside of the building looking like it was being prepared for demolition with scaffolding covering the entire front of the building and the building looking old and decrepit.Upon entry through narrow make shift entry we were told to take a seat without being informed why as it was 3 hours passed check in time.After waiting ten minutes with no one approaching we were served a cold drink on a coaster that had been used many times before and had the stains to prove it.Finally a staff member approached to say the room wasn't ready just yet. The request was then made by ourselves to see the room first. Shortly afterwards we were told we would receive an upgrade and room would be ready in another 10 mintues. We were escorted to the 16th floor to where it was clear the lobby matched the rest of the hotel in being old and lacking maintenance. Whilst walking along the hallway paint in large areas could be seen peeling off the walls.Upon entering the room initial presentation looked okay. When looking near the window the white curtain was extremely dirty below the glass . An inspection of the bathroom revealed an old bath and shower in one and then on looking at the sink, human hair could be seen. We immediately requested to see another room to which we were told we would have to wait further. We waited in the room given for about 40 minutes before being moved to the 20th and top floor. The room slight better presented than the other still showed many signs of age including a horrible repair on the side of the bath that was all blistered and cracked.Later in the evening we received a recommendation from the front desk for an indian restaurant and confirmed we would a taxi with a meter. The staff member said he would tell the taxi directly of the address after I asked for the address in case we got lost. Instead of telling the driver he passed it onto the front door staff.When we walked outside I heard a loud speaker coming from next door and could see some taxis parked around the corner (these taxis are repeatedly used by the hotel). Not long after a very old taxi struggled to pull up and as we got in the driver, a boy lucky to be 18 was hurriedly putting on a blue shirt and clearly had been asleep. The front door staff told the driver three times of the nearby restaurant it was very clear to see he didn't know where it was yet they allowed him to leave. We left the hotel and not 200 metres up the road the driver stopped the car and run off to find directions. He returned 2 minutes later, proceeded to drive on the wrong side of the road and then tried to tell us a fixed price. As soon as possible we got out and walked back to the hotel. On the way back the driver was following telling us he would take us for free. Upon our return to the hotel, we immediately complained about the situation where another staff member lied to us and told us the fixed price was the mimimum price. (later the price it would be not even 60%) After being questioned further the staff member agreed the rate should be by the meter. This clearly brings the question of corruption and hotel allowing the taxi's to charge more and makes you wonder about kick backs!!! Not nice when the hotel is being deceptive and trying to rip you off. Finally another taxi was arranged and after we refused the same driver another was found. This driver again to our dismay did not know where the restaurant was and after stopping for directions several times gave up and dropped us off somewhere near the restaurant where we walked around for 10 minutes getting directions before finding it. (turned out it was not difficult to find and close to where we were dropped off except we were sent in the other direction)The following morning whilst using the shower my wife slipped over in the slipery bath which had not bath matt. Breakfast was ordinary with no chef there to cook a fresh omelette or eggs which is standard in every good hotel. Then we waited for 15 minutes for the lifts to leave the building. With only two lifts for the guests they cannot cope, so much so that we later found out one of the lifts jammed a full load of guests were actually stuck in the lifts for 5 minutes. After all this we checked out 2 days early what a bad hotel. This hotel claims to be 4 star, it would be lucky to be a 3 star!!! Find somewhere else it's old, service poor, it's dirty and smells of corruption!!! "
hans plaza ,"Great hotel. Perfect launchpad from which to see Delhi then return and unwind. Delhi and the Hans Plaza was my first stop in India. I had no idea what to expect, so I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. First of all, it's ideally located. You can hop in a tuktuk for 40 rupees and be at Connaught Place in under 5 minutes. The hotel itself is a tall tower, I think 17 stories if memory serves. The facade is undergoing some mild renovations, nothing major. The interior is spotless, businesslike, and modern. The rooms are really pleasant - excellent quiet AC, nice linens, modern furniture, plasma TV, safe, great views of the city, and a clean marble/granite bathroom with iron, blowdryer, etc. It's extremely comfortable and clean. A+ overall.The restaurants are on the 2nd floor. The amazing thing about this hotel is free Wifi if you stay more than 2 nights, and also buffet breakfast (excellent) and a meal voucher for two people every day which can be redeemed all day, anytime (including after midnight). The meal voucher includes almost anything off the menu, and the portions are huge. Excellent food overall, first rate kitchen they are running.Overall, an excellent hotel for the money and the perfect place to see Delhi from. It's not uberluxurious, but if you want a clean, neat, modern spot to come back to and shower/sleep, it's perfect. "
hans plaza ,"Centrally Located This is one of the good hotel located centrally in New Delhi. Very much in the heart of the city i.e, CP. View of the capital city Delhi from room’s window is marvelous. You can have a bird’s view &amp; that is the most important point of this hotel. Its away from airport but near to railway station.Rooms are clean, well decorated. Food is OK but very costly. Its recommended for business trip. "
hans plaza ,"A good place to stay in Delhi We liked all the positive aspects described by other reviewers. I liked the restaurant with a view of trees.Its only a short walk to circus area with shops and restaurants, its not the wild west as described by a previous reviewer and apart from crossing the busy roads its safe.There are also some good views across the city looking toward the train station in the distance "
hans plaza ,Customer friendly attitude of Hotel Staff This Hotel located in the Heart of the City is best suited to travellers whether on a pleasure trip or business.Staff extremely attentive to your needs and my room stay was extended when they realized that i had an evening flight to catch and my room was also automatically upgraded from executive to deluxe upon my arrival.really appreciate their efforts. 
hans plaza ,"Loved the Room and Location We had been to a conference in Delhi, We happen to stay at this hotel for two nights. This was my fourth visit to this hotel. Every visit of mine was same with warm welcome. They serve welcome drink on arrival. The Rooms are on very higher floor with view of the city. It is just excellent. If given a chance to travel to our national capital I shall surely stay with this hotel on my every visit to Delhi "
hans plaza ,Great experience It was a great experience at Hotel stay. Staff and service was excellent. Location of the Hotel was good. Close to shopping area CP of delhi.Timing and quality of breakfast was good.Overall it was a nice experience 
hans plaza ,Pleasant stay My office arranged for the hotel accomodation for this trip and i did not expect to have a hotel room on the 18th floor. The view of the busy roads of Delhi was quite a sight. One can't help thinking that Delhi is lucky to have such wide roads with four to six lanes on each side.The room size was adequate but the carpet could do with some vacumming. The house keeping surely could improve and the standard is clearly indicated from the towels that are kept for use.The food however is good. And the location of the hotel is central.I would recommend this hotel as a pleasant stay provided the stay is not for more than 2 days. 
hans plaza ,"Good location; warm staff Have stayed at this hotel about 5/6 times during my business visit. Centrally located, very good restaurants, clean rooms and overall a very nice place to stay. My frequent visits were good enough for me to get upgrades. "
hans plaza ,"Excellent clean hotel in cental Delhi We stayed in the hotel as part of a package and it was very good. They upgraded our room as we were going to be there for 9 nights and the rooms on the 19th floor are big and clean, although the lifts a little erratic. The location is certainly central as it's only about 10 minutes walk into Connaught Place and 5 to the nearest tube, but there is hassle the moment you step out the door! The restaurants are good although a little on the expensive side. Breakfast a mix of indian and western food so should be plenty for most tastes. Transfers weren't included in the deal so as we were arriving at 5.30am local time after a 15 hour flight I e-mailed to arrange a pick up. They charged a whooping 1,400 rupees for this whereas local taxi companies charge normally 400 rupees so worth e-mailing one of the reliable companies in Delhi instead. "
hans plaza ,"First Hotel experiance in India - loved it The hotel was part of a tour package. My room was clean, the bed comfortable and staff very attentive to this tired travlers needs. Although the outside noise could filter up to my top floor room, one pull of the drapes and all was blocked out. Highly recommend. "
hans plaza ,"Comfortable clean hotel in good location Excellent hotel although slightly overpriced. Clean comfortable rooms. Great location. Helpfull staff, but extras such as tours organised through the hotel more expensive than at other hotels we stayed at. "
hans plaza ,"Very nice hotel. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for the start of a 3.5 week tour of India and was pleasantly surprised.The room, although not very large, was beautifully appointed.Nice, clean and modern bathroom.The breakfasts were great. Interesting Indian food as well as continental.Good location - close to the (very clean and modern) metro line.I would certainly consider staying here again.In my opinion it was an excellent introduction to India. "
hans plaza ,"Book through their website not over the phone or via a third party!! After perusing tripadvisor and seeking a place in downtown Delhi for 100$ and quality, we found this one. I checked out their website and found a rate of 102$. Couldn't believe it so I called them. They quoted my 260$ on the phone. I told them that they're site was 102$. They agreed. THIS WAS JANUARY 2ND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I then went to expedia and bla bla and they all quoted over 200$. So, I booked online.Then, after I booked, they sent me an email if I had any special requests. Great service! I asked for two housecoats, some slippers, a good bathtub, and a high floor. No problem.We arrived at around 6pm and sure enough all of our requests were met.The room is wonderfully clean with a great bed and good room service. The rates are all fine and it really is a 4 star.The location is gold but still a rickshaw is required as there are plenty of pathetic touts around the hotel. We had two follow us to 'practice thei english'so I just took a photo of them and walked up to a police officer. They ran. I just asked the police officer the time, but anyway, it worked.Great place, very clean, and honest front desk people. incredible price and the best accom secret in Delhi. "
hans plaza ,"We enjoyed this hotel but asked to change rooms We have no idea what we actually paid to stay at this hotel for three nights as it was part of a package that included airport to and fro transfers, transfers to train to Agra plus Agra (Taj &amp; Fort) tour with a guide. Having said that, given the overall package price I think it was very reasonable. We got a guide one day to tour Delhi itself then the other two days were arrival and Agra so we did not see much of the surrouding area of Connought. We did speak to some guests who thought it was fine to walk around the area and they said they felt safe both during the day as well as the evening. There is a pretty good mixed Asian/North American breakfast buffet (included) so anyone should be quite happy. The lobby is pleasant and the staff were always helpful. When we arrived and were shown to our room and we were really disappointed. The bed looked so small I knew that two of us could not comfortably sleep in it for three nights! The room was also very small and if there was any window it was not immediately obvious. It may well be that is what we paid for - so hard to know what they actually book for you in a package and call a double room, but the porter himself made a call and the next thing we knew he took us to another huge room with a king bed, huge corner window views complete with loveseat and it was great. There was no additional charge when we checked out so I think the hotel is pretty decent for doing that. Big difference between the room though so try to check to see what it is you are getting. Often a double room is simply a double bed - not even a queen and many are not used to that! This hotel was only a few minutes drive to the train for Agra as well. "
hans plaza ,"Stayed Twice During a Recent Vacation A perfectly acceptable hotel. Nothing special, but clean and modern. Good central location. "
hans plaza ,"Clean hotel helpful staff convenient location Firstly you need to look beyond the exterior of the hotel, which is absolutely terrible and in serious need of updating -- the inside of the Hans is clean, well looked after and the rooms are well furnished and a reasonable size. They are also high enough away from the street to shield you from the incessant traffic noise outside (remember, this is the centre of Delhi).The staff speak good English and were helpful and attentive to our many requests, at any time of day or night, including helping to dress a saree for the wedding we were attending. They are also generous with providing complimentary bottled water, which is a must in India.The complimentary breakfast is of a good quality, runs until 10am if you don't want to get up too early, and the choice is reasonable. The hotel restaurant offers both Indian and Western food and the standard is quite high.The location is convenient, being 5-10 minutes walk from Connaught Place. But be warned, it really is a walk on the wild side!! Despite being right by a supposedly upmarket shopping area in the nation's capital, you should be prepared for manic and downright dangerous traffic, beggars, thieves, wild dogs roaming the streets, people constantly trying to sell you trinkets or get you into a rickshaw, dust, dirt and pollution that hurts your eyes and throat. Suffice to say, we only tried this walk once.In summary, the Hans Hotel is rare in being a good quality mid-range hotel in a convenient location. If you really have to go to Delhi and don't want to run to 5 star prices or risk somewhere more downmarket then this is a good choice. "
hans plaza ,"Excellent place to stay at while touring Delhi After a disastorous start to our trip to Delhi with a different hotel, we booked into this hotel at the last minute.Excellent staff, excellent rooms and service.Rooms are on par with a 4 star hotel in UK and all the amenities were present, like table, chairs, flat screen tv, nice king size bed,safe etc.The walls are quite thin so you could hear next door which was the only down side.The breakfast was included although it adequate and not spectacular.Overall good place to stay to explore New Delhi. "
hans plaza ,Good start to a tour Located close enough to many restaurants and shops but the hotel floors are high enough that you are not disturbed by traffic noises. Very clean and nice hotel. Excellent breakfast. 
hans plaza ,"Stayed here November 2008 Stayed 2 nights at the Hans Hotel in November, 2008. Didn't actually stay in the room much, as I was on tours all day, both days. This is one of the least expensive, but nicer hotels, though the Deluxe room is a bit small.The problem I had is that I called Housekeeping 3 times to bring a power adapter, as my universal kit does not fit the power outlets in India. They kept saying &quot;yes&quot; but it never came. "
hans plaza ,"Looks Belie The Facts We booked three rooms for our family members on our way back to Auckland after the marriage of our son in Amritsar.The hotel looks okay but the office staff are terrible-eg I get a call at 11pm one night asking me when will I settle the hotel bill !The Italian Restaurant meal had a fly cooked in our fried egg- miraculously they did not charge us for that meal. Kaffe restaurant meals and staff were the best thing this hotel has got.Showers in the room leaked, toilet paper was rationed as if there is a world wide shortage.On my advice a family has this week cancelled their booking at Hans Plaza- it is well located but the charges are like a five star. "
hans plaza ,"Terrible customer service This hotel is in the heart of the city and centrally located. However that customer service is terrible. There were so many issues including the additional dollars they charged for a cancelled night. The manager was least helpful if trying to work with a customer who has been to the hotel before. Yes the hotel is close by the train station and in the middle of delhi, and the price is not bad. However, the customers are paying for a service, which is not there. From the bell hop, to the front desk clerk to the manager and the restaurant staff, there is no hospitality. I am not going to stay here anyone. "
hans plaza ,"Not worth the money I stayed at the Hans for one night because it was close to New Delhi Railway station. I was told by the front desk who checked me in that I was upgraded to a better room so was happy. Upon initial entry, the room seemed good enough and worthy of the 5 star rating of the hotel (As well as the high price for India).However, as soon as I looked at the bed I found that three of the four pillows on the bed did not have pillow covers, and two of the four pillows had horrible yellow stains on them, not a good start. Also, I found some tiny insects walking on the bed sheet, the room wasn't bright enough and I did'nt have a flash light but I am fairly confident they looked like baby bed bugs. The bathroom only had one towel, and the shampoo bottle was already opened and previously used. If this were a budget hotel I would not complain, but this is a five star hotel and is the most expensive hotel I stayed in India, but was by far the worst. There is also a lot of noise from the street, some people may say this is India, but I stayed in other hotel that were very quiete at night. "
hans plaza ,great hotel stayed 2 days in the hotela great reward to end your trip in indiathe best hotel i have ever beena bit expensive for india but worth it 
hans plaza ,"Really good hotel but a bit overexpensive This hotel is located at a great location close to Jantar Mantar and a Metro Station. We were served with drinks upon arrival and even our rooms were upgraded to a bigger one. The food is perhaps the best that I've had in New Delhi; The food served at the Kaffa restaurant at the Hans is better than all of the Five Star Hotels that I've stayed at in New Delhi even though it is only a Four Star Hotel. The staff was friendly and cooperative and the rooms were EXTREMELY clean. The decor was soothing to the eyes. The buffet breakfast was also excellent...I recommend their doughnuts especially.The downside is that the food and beverages were ridiculously expensive and service charges were astronomical; In fact, The Intercontinental The Grand (which is just a stone's throw away from this hotel) is actually cheaper to the Hans in this regard. The airport taxi that we requested was also unbelievably highly priced for New Delhi (About 1200 rupees). Cellphone reception was also terrible as my Airtel line was continuously searching for a Network except at the door's entrance.But I had a wonderful stay and look forward to come back to this hotel someday. "
hans plaza ,"Reasonable Stay...But be careful of the details..... The Hans Plaza is a clean and centrally located hotel which offers one a sense of comfort at what seems to be a reasonable price for Delhi ($150 inc. taxes per night). Overall staff was very friendly - but one has to be careful of a few things:1. There are vast differences b/w the different rooms with regard to confort and age of beds etc. Also, ask for room facing North-quieter and better view.2. If everything goes OK- then things are great - if not - it is hard to get satisfaction. We received a room where the airconditioner &quot;bubbled&quot; for about an two hours. They could not reallty fix it and were not terribly interested in compensating us for the above - though we lost two hours of sleep because of the above..3. Do not use their car services-they are far too expensive.But, all in all- a reasonabl;e place if you keep in mind the above. "
hans plaza ,"Great place to stay for a cheap price! This was a great hotel for the price. It does not have all the fancy frills and thrills that the five star hotels in Delhi have, but you also don't have to pay $600.00 to stay here. The resteraunts at the hotel are good, and offer a variety of foods to eat. I stayed in three different rooms over a 3 week period, and all the rooms were clean. They upgraded me the last day I stayed there to the deluxe room, which was very nice. I would definitely recommend staying here if your looking for a good room, at a cheap price (cheap for New Delhi). "
hans plaza ,"Great hotel! We stayed here as part of a tour group and had an excellent stay. The rooms were a good size and start on the 15th floor, going up to the 20th floor from what I could tell by the buttons in the lift (floors 5-14 were missing). This meant for good views over Delhi from the room, which was great as I could watch the black kites circling in the sky outside. The beds were a decent size and comfortable, and although the room felt very cold, at least the air conditioning was adjustable, so I could make it a more suitable temperature.The bathroom was clean and of a good size - the shower area was great as there was plenty of space to dry off as well as shower.We ate at the Kaffe restaurant on the 2nd floor and found the food of a high standard, trying out a variety of foods including the pizza, thai curry, burger and hotpot. It was some of the best food I've eaten! The service was quick and the waiters were attentive.The reception staff and porters were very helpful. Currency can be changed at a very fair rate at the hotel reception and stamps can be bought from the porters - as far as I know they were also going to post my postcards for me as they told me they would deal with them. "
hans plaza ,"Ok but a bit on the expensive side Hans Hotel is a pretty nice place. The rooms are big, the views are nice and the restaurant is good. In fact, as an American traveling in India for several weeks, it was absolutely wonderful as they served beef! I cannot tell you how awesome that was. The price is a bit high for what you get but then again Delhi is not exactly an easy place to nab a room for a good price. Overall, my experience was good. The staff seems pretty willing to help. They were quite good at helping me out of a jam with a driver who clearly tried to overcharge me for a day trip around Delhi. The location is quite good also, right in the heart of New Delhi, not down some dark and disgusting alley. If the price is right, seriously consider going with them! "
hans plaza ,"Quite pleased The hotel provided a welcoming plate of fruit and cookies upon my late arrival after 1 am. The room was very clean, had a flat screen TV, and nice little extras such as free bottled water and a kettle. It was a nice start to my trip. Overall it was utilitarian rather than elegant, but the condition of everything was excellent. "
hans plaza ,"Smart modern hotel We stayed here as part of a private tour and I was impressed with the hotel. We had a good first night here after arriving by plane and a pleasant pit stop on the last night of the tour.From the description, it seems rather expensive but, as has been said elsewhere, this is an expensive city for hotels and there isn't really a middle ground. It's not in the same league as the big name hotels but I'd stay here again.If I were going to invest in something, I'd buy a Travel Lodge franchise in India and set up low cost modern hotels! "
hans plaza ,"Good average Stayed at the Hans Hotel (no longer Hans Plaza) beginning of October. Reception was friendly. We arrived earlier than expected in the morning, they still gave us a room earlier than booked for, but had to wait a little while. The rooms are on the 14 th floor, so there is an excellent view over delhi. The room was &quot;a good average&quot;), but not the rating given for the hotel ( a common problem in Delhi). We had booked directly on the hotels web site, which was a rate as good as any other internet booking engine. At the beginning of October, I would say the prices were ok (for Delhi), but the rose significantly later in th month. Breakfast buffet was adequate, but not a huge selection. When we looked at the building on the outside, we were shocked at the statte of the facade (floors below the hotel floors), and hoped it did not reflect the state of the building structure. (fotos).Hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place.Prepaid taxi from delhi airport is the best option. For retrun to the airport, the reception offered ther own cars (more expensive) , but also offered to phone a taxi "
hans plaza ,"Hans Plaza - Not Bad At All Arrived in India in Delhi with prebooked premium double room for 3 nights at Hans Plaza. Spent $275/night including taxes thru Travelocity. This was in beginning of high season, end of September. Arrived at midnight and was told that our room was not available until the next day but they had an upgraded suite for our first night. At first, the suite seemed quite nice but the a/c wasn't adequate, and in the morning we were constantly disturbed by what sounded like a sing-songy door-bell. It was the service elevator bell which was hidden right next to our suite. Really horrible to hear every 5 minutes when you are whacked out on jet lag. If you stay here, beware of this suite location next to the service elevator. Next morning, they switched us to room 1912 on the corner and it was splendid: a/c worked fantastic, the toilet flush was powerful, the hot water shower was fine. Room was bright, quiet, clean and comfortable enough. I have the feeling that the rooms may differ greatly in this hotel. Don't know what the regular doubles look like. Desk personnel were very, very helpful with our many inquiries. Room attendants were eager to please when we asked for extra towels, etc. Staff overall was really very nice. An ordinary but large buffet breakfast was included. The Indian food was better than the western. Odd to be offered chicken cacciatore for breakfast! Location of hotel was very good, walkable to Connaught Circle and easy to get rickshaws for other attractions. Note: I noticed the prices for the Hans vary a lot on the internet travel services, and I missed out on a $150/night &quot;Good Buy&quot; from Travelocity that came and went fast. I recommend staying here if you want a large, convenient hotel in Delhi in the $200-$300 range after taxes. It is an overpriced city. "
hans plaza ,"Beware An average hotel with lifts that dont workBeware of using their phone, I made a five minute call to the UK and they tried to charge me over £40!The location is good but the restaurant is overpriced.You can do better "
hans plaza ,"Average Hotel in Delhi The Hans Hotel is well located in Conaught Place. It ia a bit poor hotel for the price. In Europe you would get a far better hottel fot the price you pay. But Delhi in general is far more expensive then the rest of India in terms of hotels and I belive there is no mid range. Nothing special, just clean. The air conditioning works well, it is actually pretty cold in the hotel and the breakfast not bad. "
hans plaza ,"Don't be duped by the 4 star label!! We were travelling for the first time in India for both business and pleasure and part of our trip had to include a visit north to see the amazing Taj Mahal. We arranged a stopover in New Delhi and because it was our first time we used the Flightcentre website (based in Australia) to review and book a hotel there. We are used to travelling in business class and it was important for us to have a good quality hotel whereever we stayed. Flightcentre had rated this hotel as four star but when we arrived we were in for a real shock - more like a one star than anything - the rooms were dreadful, small and pokey and threadbare!! Certainly none of the amenities one expects from this rating accomodation were there - by the way this was halfway through our trip and we had stayed in some amazing 4 and 5 star hotels throughout India (NOT booked through flightcentre), so this was not a case of misunderstanding the quality provided in India. Anyway we grabbed our luggage and got out of there as fast as we could and moved to the stunning Imperial Hotel that was one of the best hotels we have stayed in ever. So moral of the story - be wary of ratings - especially from Flightcentre, Australia - and if you are looking for a budget style, very basic hotel with a 4 star price tag then Hans Plaza in New Delhi is the place. (ps - flightcentre refused to reimburse us for our booking because we didn't give 72 hours cancellation notice !!!!) "
hans plaza ,"A lil expensive for an average stay In the 3 hotels that we've stayed during our trip in India covering Delhi, Agra (Sheraton Mughal) &amp; Mumbai (Ascot Hotel), the Hans Plaza was expensive for a pretty average hotel stay. We paid Rs6500 for a triple-sharing room &amp; Rs5500 for a twin-sharing room incl. buffet breakfasts. The lobby was modern (seems newly renovated) in the minimalistic/&quot;zen&quot; look and we were offered cooling welcome drinks while we were checked-in. The reception staff were cordial &amp; efficient at checking us in.The concierge/bell person was friendly &amp; helpful in helping us to get our bags to the room. We got both rooms side by side and right near the elevators but we slept well without much disturbances from outside though the doors were pretty thin. The rooms were clean with woodish floors and marble flooring at the entrance &amp; to the bathroom.Twin rooms were a good size but it gets a little cramped with the extra bed in the triple sharing room. TV has over 60 channels but most were in Hindi though there is StarMovies &amp; HBO.Bathroom only have showers (no bathtub) but clean and water pressure is good. We had some problems with the hot water kettle and some of the power points did not work. The staff were very helpful though and fast in responding to our needs.You do get very good views outside as the rooms are all located above the 15th floor. The only downside is that the two tiny elevators are a little slow and sometimes you have to wait a while for it.There is a good selection at breakfast buffet for both local &amp; international tastes. However the variety is the same daily so after a few days, you'll get kinda bored with the food.Overall we had a comfortable stay. It was well-located, within minutes of walking to Connaught Place and the area was safe.I suppose this may be good value in Delhi where hotel prices are known to be sky high at times! We did see quite a few business type people staying at the hotel so I guess this is considered a business class hotel. "
hans plaza ,"Great relief to get to the Hans Plaza Great location, within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and subway/metro station right around the corner.Welcoming drinks, very helpful staff, clean and modern facilities.The restaurant has good breakfast (Indian and Western).We stayed at this hotel during the last part of our trip to India, which was a great relief for us, after being just about everywhere.Two minor issues:1. The charge (and not cheap) for internet access in the room.2. Some people arrived in the middle of the night, with zero common sense, making plenty of noise.Bottom line, trying to save some money staying somewhere cheaper may be a really bad experience. This is a safe bet and good value. "
hans plaza ,"Incredible IndiaIncredible Hans... We were a group of friends on our 02nd trip to Incredible India and we must say that she was enchanting as ever and the stay at Hans was the icing on the cake. A fabolous hotel run by a wonderful team. Personalized but at the same time professional. Special thanks to the ever so friendly Front office team, F&amp;B team and the perfect service from the House keeping. The rooms were spec and clean at all times. The USP of Hans is the splendid view you will have of Delhi from the rooms. With the rooms on the 16 - 18th floor, you cant ask for anything more grandeur. If we go in search of short comings, the only draw back..a minute one is in the Italian Restaurant, when cooking with cheeses, it will be great if you could mention in the menu as well the type of cheeses used because the cheese can change the flavour of the dish completely and rightfully, it will be great to know whether its your preferred choice. And to serve double esspressos in the appropriate cup rather than a normal coffee cup. Th reason being that, The infrastructure and the decor of the Restaurants are definitely to the latest International dining experiences, the accompanying cutleries and the crockeries should definitely compliment it. Rest assured, IT'S DEFINITELY VALUE FOR MONEY! AND DEFINITELY SALUTES INCREDIBLE INDIA. Thanks to the wonderful team for making our stay memorable. Alessia Falconi,Federica Cenci, Carmine Selvaggio, Mirko Mancuso, Antony John. "
hans plaza ,"Good location lovely hotel This is a well situated hotel. I was pleasantly surprised with my room, it was larger than average, very clean and of a high 4-star standard. Breakfast was always a treat and I ordered room service once which was also very good and reasonably priced. The staff were courtious and very helpful. The hotel is a 2 min walk to the metro - an excellent way to get around! Overall, Hans Plaza is highly recommended - and I'm very fussy so that's a huge compliment!! "
hans plaza ,"Average hotel good restaurant I stayed here as part of a tour group - but I've seen how expensive it is on their website and I would have not paid that much.Rooms - clean and comfortable - great views over New DelhiReception staff - not brilliant - short changed on our currency exchange, got our alarm call wrong (called us 1 hour early - irritating).Housekeeping - came very quickly when I complained the hairdryer didn't work. Noise - no double glazing here - plus there was building works during the day.Restaurant - good breakfasts and worth a visit for lunch or dinner. Staff here very friendly, although getting a cup of tea in the morning is a bit of an effort.Location - good central location.I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends. "
hans plaza ,"Good business traveler's hotel well-located We spent the first two nights of our Indian holiday in this centrally located hotel, close to shopping and with easy access to both New and old Delhi. The breakfast was good, though it felt a bit warm in the sunshine through the windows of the breakfast room. The room was adequate in size, modern in facilities, comfortable, and clean. The staff was unenthusiastic but adequate. We would stay here again. "
hans plaza ,"A Bad Experience We wish we had read the reviews before choosing this hotel. It was truly a bad experience. Firstly, we arrived at 1 p.m. and needed to rest after a long flight. They were repairing a sewer pipe in the next room, hammering it out of concrete, this went on till 11 p.m. When we complained to the manager, he turned his back and walked away. The restaurant had been moved to the second floor, our hotel directory stated it was on the top floor. The wait time for food was exceptionally long and the restaurant Manager lined up three of the restaurant staff and started shouting at them in front of customers. The front desk was not helpful in arranging transport to a tourist attraction that we wanted to visit. I could go on, but I think that is enough. "
hans plaza ,"Among the Worst in more than Eur 100 per night hotels in the World Staying in this hotel is really an awful experience which started from the reservation for me. This hotel does not respond to e-mails and their booking forms on the website. You get welcomed by a poorly lit entrance, shabby lobby and reception area. Cable TV was out of order in 2 out of 4 nights I stayed there. From hot water tap once muddy water came out. The electric kettle for tea/coffe in the room had a UK plug which of course does not work in India. The remote control for TV was broke. This hotel needs a big overhaul, repaint and motivated staff. It does a great damage to an already bad image of Indian hotels. Just a week back I stayed at Novotel in Madrid for 65 Eur per night, it was just perfect. For 100 Eur per night this hotel sucks!! They do not have indoor swimming pool as they advertise on Expedia. In fact in India, there are hardly many indoor pools. "
hans plaza ,"Nice room- terrible service We booked the Hans Plaza via the internet for three people. Upon arrival, we were given a room with a king size bed and told that a cot and extra amenities would be delievered soon. Despite many repeated calls to reception, housekeeping and management they were never delivered. At check out, we were charged an extra 25USD for the cot, which never arrived. When discussed with management they refused to amend the bill. The room itself was modern and clean- but pity about the terrible service. "
hans plaza ,"Expensive not 4 stars We booked this hotel on-line. The photos shown were not like the hotel. Internet connection was done via WIFI and very expensive because it was so slow. The bar staff at the roof top bar were the slowest people ever, no imported beers avaliable.There was only a hand full of chairs no where to sit.The roof top resturants was closed too. The resturant on floor 2 was clean and newly decorated, but very slow again.we waited 1 hour for our food and drinks, and there was only 4 tables of people eating. The place needs a good clean up outside, rubbish blowing about etc. Food for breakfast was always cold. The toaster was broke too. The plus point is that its only a 10 min walk to the Inner Circle of Connaught Place! "
hans plaza ,"standard well located and friendly We stayed 2 nights in Hans Plaza at arrival and departure from India in Feb-March 06. First time, the room needed renovation but the second room on the 17th floor was OK with a superb view. The lobby area is not very accomodating but the staff was friendly and helpfull. It's worth the price "
hans plaza ,"Good hotel - 3 stars Stayed in this hotel as part of group a three families, on arrival in Delhi and just before departure. Had no problems with our accommodation: it was clean and warm. Rception staff a bit lazy and aloof. Restaurant staff charming. Food excellent! "
hans plaza ,"Small A very nice hotel. We spent one night there. The Hotel lacks the facilities of pool, gym,etc., but the staff are very good and kind. they run a good show. Breakfast buffet is decent "
hans plaza ,"Not a good hotel! Please do not stay at this hotel...especially if you have kids!We got to the hotel very late in the night...3am,the room was below average, the toilet looked clean but there was a nasty smell, the shower was broken!To top it off though our electricity kept cutting out, that was because I was trying to warm up my baby's milk in the kettle provided...basically everytime I put the kettle on the electric would go, it took 4 phone calls and a visit by the duty manager to rectify this.I asked the manager if our breakfast could be sent to our room as a one off as it was very late now and we may not get up in time, he said he was not sure if he could do that but he would get back to me, guess what,never heard from him after that.Dont stay here if you can help it...disgusting service and manky rooms! "
hans plaza ,"really really bad I stayed here recently and had a really bad experience.First of all reserving a room was a hassle. One person says rooms are available and an other says not available. They also seem to cheat people on the rates mentioned on their website. As soon as you talk to them they change the rates especially if you are foreigner. I had to get a person in India to book in Indian Rupees to get a cheaper rate. So if you are a paying in dollars, good luck. The customer service is bad. The room's lock is broken, tv signal is of very poor quality. Had to wait for a long time to get response from reception. Tried to get a car at the front-desk but did not get the car on time or a hotel car as promised, but instead given a third party car which is barely running. The driver assigned was also rude, drove recklessly even for indian standards and did not bother listening to anything i said and stopped at places for his own errands.Th breakfast was below average also, very few varieties and they even charge exorbitantly for drinking water. And finally while checking out, the receptionist calculated the bill wrongly and cannot even do basic math like (16 + 18) and they charged me more than they quoted. When I questioned the bill they tried to trick me by saying that the dollar rate changed, blah blah blah... after which i told them i booked the room in indian rupees and told them its really not good cheating customers just because you can get away. In summary, I am never ever going to stay or recommend this hotel to any my friends. "
hans plaza ,"Hans Plaza - hit and miss I stayed in the Hans Plaza for 3 nights over a 10 day period and was impressed with 2 of the nights I stayed there. Was given a very nice room on the 19th floor each time with excellent decor and in room facilities - good size bathroom also. The 3rd night I checked in there I was given a room on the 17th floor which was far inferior to their other rooms. I complained but was told they were full. No bathtub, no coffee/tea facilities and not even bedspreads on the beds. In my opinion only 3 star standard for these rooms. I was also kept waiting 3 hours until 1.30 for this room with no apology from reception or refreshments while waiting. I would stay here again but only if guaranteed one for their newer rooms. Breakfast is poor unless you want a cooked one-stale pastries and toast otherwise. This could be an excellent hotel if they complete the refurbishment and retrain reception staff. "
hans plaza ,"Good value for money I've stayed in Hans Plaza in September 2004. Although the rooms need renovation and the reception area is not that comfortable, I still found it value for money. The staff was friendly and helpfull. On the last floor there is a restaurant (included breakfast was very good) from where (if the weather is clear) you have a great panorama view of Delhi. Connaught Place and Janpath are 15 min. walk away. "

hotel 55 ,"Expensive for what it is I am not sure if it is worth to stay into this hotel. I think it is too expensive for what it is.PROSLocationCONSThey ripped us off with the taxi cost coming from the airport, use the prepaid taxi when you arrive at the airport.Not really cleanNoisyForget about the restaurant "
hotel 55 ,"Whole area - Under construction I don't know if it is the looming commonwealth games but the whole area around this hotel is 'under construction', which made getting to it (and even finding it) quite difficult, it also didn't feel very safe at night. Hotel staff were helpful, rooms were dodgy (run down and dusty) well overpriced, basically your paying for the city location. "
hotel 55 ,Economical no frills hotel right on Connaught Place. It was a clean and economically priced hotel right on Connaught Place. Surprisingly quiet seeing as how we had a room next to the circle. Nothing fancy but great as a centrally located place as we came back through Delhi for one night on our way home. 
hotel 55 ,It's somewhere to get your head down... Hotel 55 is an adequate hotel with a 70's styled interior which is quite in need of an update. It is centrally located in Connaught Place and thus convenient for exploring. Our double room was cool and for a pleasant change there was no requirement for AC of the fan on during the night. Bedding was musty but clean and the decor is average. Shower was hot and towels provided. Staff were friendly and helpful.This is not a luxurious hotel and should not be regarded as anything other than a convenient centrally located overpriced hostel. It is absolutely a 1* (at best) and guests should not expect something modern or luxurious. 
hotel 55 ,"Adequate and comfortable good service Hotel 55 is an excellent option to stay when exploring Delhi.Rooms are clean, staff are friendly, good airport pick up.Be aware of unscrupulous travel agents that roam around and in the hotel. "
hotel 55 ,"Ticks most of the boxes for budget accommodation in Delhi I have been staying at the &quot;55&quot; for nearly twenty years, on a fairly regular basis, and do not recognise some of the negative reviews which have been posted regarding it. No, it's not a luxury hotel (it doesn't claim to be), nor does it have a sumptuous dining room or gorgeous bathrooms. What it does have is friendly and unfailingly helpful management and staff, comfortable and clean rooms, and in the very heart of New Delhi (superbly located for the railway station by the way). The tariff is not bargain basement (but then what is cheap in Delhi nowadays?), but given its plus points I wouldn't stay anywhere else (although I would avoid the front rooms, which tend to be a little noisy!) "
hotel 55 ,"one star only Stayed about three nights; safety and courtesy was not an issue for us (we were an all female entourage); staff was nice and helpful; my emails were always promptly replied to. This is a one-star hotel, described as mid-range by Lonely Planet and in some other sources as a three star--but its not. Hotels in Delhi are expensive, which may explain the cost of this place. But for a thousand more rupees ($20), you can get nicer rooms that are a welcome respite from the craziness that travel in India can be. Rooms are small, bathrooms are purely functional but grotty and inconsistent, of our three rooms, only one shower actually worked; only one provided hot water. To be fair, we did not complain but only because we did not expect the problem to be solved within the time we had. There was no internet access from what I could see.For backpackers looking for a great deal, this is not it. For travelers who want just a touch more amenities or if you are staying more than a night, I'd look elsewhere. "
hotel 55 ,hi ther im nshat from iraq thes hotel it is Very good and Comfortable and Good service and The most important thing in Central City I stayed three days in it 
hotel 55 ,"Hotel 55 inexpensive and safe. I had a nice stay at Hotel 55. Before one books here, they need to set their expectations. This is a one star hotel with 15 rooms. I stayed here for three weeks. I have never been waited on hand and foot like I was at Hotel 55. You have to take advantage of their hospitality. The breakfast menu was a bit limited, but the food was very good. I commonly would tell the manager I wanted some food not on the menu and it would appear about twenty minutes later. They will send someone to one of the local restaurants to get what ever you desired.The rooms and bathrooms are clean. They are simple and the fixtures are about 30 years old, but considering how horrid an Indian public bathroom can smell, there was nothing wrong with Hotel 55's bathrooms. They did not smell at all. They always had hot water. I would not recommend drinking the hotel's tap water, but they provide bottled mineral water.I never saw any bugs in my room, however on the terrace there were some small leafhoppers. These seem to be every where in Delhi. I really enjoyed the terrace, however I wish they had turned the lights off at night, so the leafhoppers were not as bad. The terrace is pretty, with potted plants and stucco walls. Its kind of amusing, the furniture on the terrace is plastic. My friends and I spent many nights enjoying that terrace.The staff was very trustworthy. That is important in a city that likes to hustle the tourists. I accidentally left my door open a few times and no one ever entered. The manager is Mohan, he was helpful arranging my travel to Jaipur and finding drivers for travel in Delhi. If you ask nicely, they might let you use their office computer for internet, otherwise, there is no wireless or ethernet.There are some things that I think were funny, but some would find a bit odd. Remember, this is India, if you are traveling here you should immerse yourself in their culture. There were two staff members who sometimes slept in the hall at night. They were very nice, gentle hearted men, and I was told that they were there to serve the clients who may be arriving very late at night. On busy nights, they did not have enough room to accommodate all of their staff members. I got used to it. If you need something, just tell them and it will be in your hand within 30 seconds. There are some rooms without windows, which seem to be quieter, the Delhi traffic is loud. I think the first floor is a bit quieter.You have to get used to having people do everything for you. You will never carry a bag, and the chi tea flows like water. I met many interesting European travelers here. Many females stayed at the hotel while I was here and they said they felt very safe.The hotel is in Connaught place. If it your first time to Delhi, you may want to avoid walking around Connaught at first, until you become more saavy at dealing with the people of the street. The hotel provided us with a car right as we walked out of the door, and took us to some nice peaceful places in Delhi. "
hotel 55 ,Worst hotel in Delhi!!! This is probably the worst hotel that I've resided in New Delhi. I still remember opening the wardrobe and a flurry of mosquitoes burst out; It was horrifying. I requested the hotel staff to atleast spray some insect repellant but it fell on deaf years. The rooms were terrible and moldy. Avoid like the plague! 
hotel 55 ,"Worst hotel ever This hotel has GOT to be the most squalid and disgusting place i've ever seen (and i've stayed in some dives). Words cannot describe how repulsive this place really is. We stayed in Delhi for 2 nights and heard about hotel 55 from the lonely planet. The hotel website is incredibly misleading and claims to be 3 star, when I would question how it was ever classified as a 1 star. In line with other reviews, the driver never arrived at the airport although the manager was adament that he was still waiting for us once we had arrived at the hotel. They gave us a filthy, small and stinking room at the front of the hotel overlooking the road. After complaining about the noise, they moved us to the 2nd floor at the rear of the hotel. This room was also filthy and looked like a prison cell. The bathroom was full of mould, grime and limscale and the bedding was filthy. The hotel staff were lounging around drinking. Cutlery and soiled linen was strewn in the corridors and remained there the 2 nights we were there. The roof terrace (if you can call it that) is big enough for 3 plastic chairs, which were also covered in black grime and mould. Thankfully, the 1 full day we spent at the hotel was taken on a day trip to Agra. On our return (which we were dreading), the room had not even been touched since we left at 5am. I felt really unsafe, especially since there appeared to be only one entrance (the hotel is situated up 2 flights of stairs above a shop) and no fire exits. The manager was very quick to mention that the lonely planet had the star rating wrong ( they accurately classify it as a 1 star, whereas the website says its a 3 star). He told us he always recommends his website as the information in the lonely planet is wrong. Frankly, it ruined our experience of Delhi and I wish I had photos to add to my review to show how disgusting and squalid the place really is. "
hotel 55 ,"okay If you are expecting any kind of luxury you will be disappointed (hotel website in this case is perhaps a bit misleading), but if you want reasonably priced (in terms of its excellent location) basic accomodation than you can't go wrong. Staff were fairly helpful. All in all I was quite satisfied with what I got for my money. Could have paid less and stayed further out from the centre, but enjoyed waking up and having everything on my doorstep, seeing as it was a short stay. Though with the advent of the Metro this location advantage may become less pronounced as it takes 10-15 minutes to travel in from cheaper location. "
hotel 55 ,"Wildly overpriced After we were stood up at the airport by Hotel Blue (just as well they didn't turn up by the look of it from the outside) we had to wander round Connaught Place in the dark looking for a hotel. Hotel 55 was the cheapest we could find but 3000rp (about $80) for this dump was a complete rip off. We only stayed there because it was too late to be lugging our backpacks around. OK sized room, dirty bathroom, fantastically noisy both from outside and in. Anywhere else in India you'd pay about 500rp for this standard. "
hotel 55 ,"the absolute worst If you enjoy staying in a windowless, grotty and filthy room smelling of gasoline, with the noise of about 10 indian guys yelling their head off until the early hours in front of your door (next to the reception), go on and book this hotel. And the guy at the reception works together with some other locals that hang around in the 'lobby' who try to scam you every way possible (they did the whole phoning-the-airline-to-reconfirm-a-flight-and-discovering-there-is-no-reservation charade, selling ridiculously expensive 'tours' that are crap, and every other scam they think you might fall for...). This is absolutely the worst place i have stayed in while in India! "
hotel 55 ,"utter dump our hearts sank when we walked into our bedroom. it was a complete dump with a rubbish bed and whilst technically it did have an ensuiteshower, i wouldn't have washed a dog in it. bearing in mind it was costing about £40 (~$80) a night it was atrocious. another aspect was that at night time there were permanently men sleeping in the corridor right outside our room - i don't know if they were meant to be security, but one was a really skinny old man with a big long beard, don't think he would have been much use in a fight - and you hear them talking when you used the toilet or even when you were lying in bedalso when we checked out the owner tried to charge me for 2 nights despite the fact i'd paid online for the first night. at the time i thought it was an innocent mistake but having read some of the other reviews i'm now wondering about that.would never go near this dump again and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone "
hotel 55 ,"hotel [--] [--] Arrived late at night on train and didn't really have any other options at that time the room was already booked when we arrived we found that the room charge they had up on the board was 1,000 Rups more than the Indiatourism pamphlet indicated, got into room and it was terrible, small grotty and generally crap. Were quite concerned that we would have visitors with more than two legs during the night. Left first thing in morning, just couldn't be bothered arguing.Best advise stay as far away from here as you can, avoid it like the plague, try something around main bazaar much cheaper and alot nicer. Connaught place is not the location it is cracked up to be. "
hotel 55 ,"Beware Hotel 55 I booked their driver to pick me up from airport and he didn't turn up. When I came to check out: they overcharged me for the room and I mistakenly paid without checking amount first. When I noticed, they admitted 'cheating' me out of money but refused to refund it. They said they would call the police if I didn't leave immediately without refund and would tell them that I had physically attacked the manager. All staff started nodding vigorously and I realised I was outnumbered and left having lost 2,500 rupees. On recounting this story to my tailor later that morning, he nodded and indicated that this was not the first time this had happened. "
hotel alka ,"Stay Away! We ended up staying here after our travel agent switched us last minute. By far, it was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Staff were rude and dismissive, rooms were like a prison cell and really dirty. The worst thing was the bad smell that was everywhere, the lobby, the rooms, the corridors!! Yuck! "
hotel alka ,"An OK hotel for someone who wants to visit CP New Delhi Well, its a very average hotel, with congested and small rooms. However, the A/C was comfortable and the bathrooms neat and clean.Its a hotel that is ideal for a short stay and charges around Rs 4500/= per night for double room.I guess the main advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the best resturants and shopping place in delhi. Its located in the P block at CP...There is a Mc Donalds right below the hotel and other famous eating joints like Nirulas, KFC, Rodeo..etc are 10 mins walk.The PVR Plaza and PVR Revoli are 5 mins walk from the hotel.Overall an ok property to stay if you are planning to spend most of your time around CP. "
hotel alka ,"Overpriced with terrible service I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Feb 2008. It was my 4th visit to India, and this is the worst hotel I've seen in the country. My wife and I had booked a double room over the phone and followed this up with an e mail. As we were arriving at 4am we wanted security that a room would be availabe. However, when we arrived, after a 8 hour flight, they had let our room go. More accurately, they said our room was &quot;under construction&quot;. No idea what this meant, but as it was 4am we had to make do with a single room, which was drab, cramped and hadn't been updated for about 30 years. We were given a camp bed, which promptly collapsed. The showers don't provide hot water in the night - it takes between 5-10 minutes to &quot;warm up&quot;. We got no apology for the cock-up, just a shrug of the shoulders. We have relatives in Delhi. They were surprised that we were staying there as it has a terrible reputation. I really would avoid this place - it's overpriced for what you get. And the service is really poor. In the interests of fairness, the location is good if you're interested in shopping at Connaught Place. And the restaurant is excellent - the food was tasty, safe and reasonable, and the service, unlike the hotel itself - excellent. "
hotel alka ,"""BEWARE"" - DON'T STAY HERE""! Unless you are on a budget ($80 and less) stay elsewhere. Delhi hotels are way way overpriced...keep that in mind. Stayed 1 night Sept 2007. Hotel is about 2 star, stayed in &quot;deluxe&quot; room, slightly larger than others. Bed's hard as a rock, dirty, no hot water. We paid $128AU p/night incl b/fast. Hotel staff O.K, very relaxed vibe. Location on Connaught Place/Radial Outer, near KFC, McDonalds, Pizza Hut (Yuk!), don't expect an Indian experience if you stay in Connaught area as its full of touts, crap shopping and food. Only saving grace is the CoffeeHouse in the inner radial, fantastic food!!!!!Problem with bottled water in fridge - all seals broken and different types of bottles in fridge. Asked reception for a bottle of sealed water and they gave us again an unsealed bottled (you know the ring thing below the lid...broken). They are obviously just collecting bottles and refilling with Delhi water. Go 2 doors down to McDonalds and buy water here, Rs 12 small bottle.If you are on holiday, and don't need stress spend more and go to LeMeridian or Shangri-La ($300AU p/night) and have good food, pool and no stress! If you are on a budget, stay elsewhere. "
hotel alka ,"The Worst Hotel I've ever seen Hotel Alka is a place you really have to avoid if you're planning to stay in Delhi for a night. We booked a double room from Italy, looking at the pictures on their site. When we arrived the room (not cheap as it costs at least 3000 Inr) was the smallest room I've ever seen and without even a WINDOW. The bath was terrific and very dirty and the bottles of water we found in the fridge were refilled as they were already open. The lights were only NEON and the result was that we were really upset. I asked to change my room and they showed us a room even worse. The hotekl terrace was a 1inch square full of destroyed things and garbage and my girlfriend wasn't able even to smoke a cigarette. So, for the 1st time in my life I decided to live the hotel without paying any rupee telling the manager we didn't want to spend a single minute in such rooms. The area of the Hotel is out of Connaught Circus because the P-Block is not in the circle (only A to N blocks are in). "
hotel alka ,"location good but hotel not good This hotel is in excellent location but is quite dingy and not even two star rating in my opinon. Hotel arranged airport transfer, it cost 925 rs really too much. On arrival, the hotelier was keen to arrange tours but fortunately that put me off. Most rooms has no natural light.The offical goverment delhi tourism office is at coffee house about 200 yards from the hotel. A full day tour in a air condition coach with an excellent tour guide costs 205 rs but you do have to pay the entry fee at each site. I thought the tour was good value. "
hotel alka ,"absolutely hopeless What a nightmere! if anyone is thinking of booking this hotel then forget it! it is not worth the trouble. It has a very central location in Connaught Place (that's the only advantage). The hotel rooms are not worth talking about. They are unclean and we had a job to get the sheets and towels changed daily. Everytime we placed the &quot;please clean my room&quot; tag on the door, the lazy room attendant very cleverly reversed this to read &quot;please do not disturb&quot;. Hence, on our return to the room later in the day, we found it as we had left it. We had to make several pleas to the manager to get our room cleaned. There is just one restaurant (vegetarian) which is boring and service is poor. The coffee shop has about 10 waiters who simply wait and watch the TV despite being called for help several times. The reception staff are just as bad! Even the manager has no time for you. Overall it is the worst hotel we have ever been to so far in India. Never again! "
hotel alka ,"bad choice the smell is the first sign we wanted to be centrally located but didn't want to pay luxury hotel prices and Alka was recommended at the airport...the elevator was being torn apart in the lobby, that was ok, then there was the smell of the hallways with the rotting carpet, bad sign. The room was ok, the only window looking out to the stairwell- why they put a window there I will never understand. Anyway, the smell of the hallways started creeping into the room and we couldn't get to sleep until 3am. Its central but being central in Delhi isn't neccesarily a good thing, it's a really dirty city. We left first thing in the morning and made our way to the Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar, south delhi, which was clean and lovely and smelled great.... "
hotel alka ,"Welcome to the House of Mirrors The best thing about the Alka Hotel is it's good location - right in Connaught Place in the very heart of New Delhi. It's a relatively clean and tidy small hotel, but the decor is dated. The decorators - back in 60's or 70's - went beserk with mirrors! One small hallway on the second floor has mirrored walls and ceilings. In my room all the walls were mirrored ... stepping out of the shower and bathroom into the bedroom was my naked reflection in the mirrors into infinity (not a pretty sight!!!!) The lobby walls are adorned with fancy gilt-framed mirrors! Are the owners of this place also in the mirror business??? By the way the restaurant on the second floor -- not the vegetarian one off the lobby -- had excellant food in a dimly lit romantic setting. The staff was friendly and helpful. "
hotel alka ,"One of the Worst Hotels I have ever stayed One of the travel agents booked this hotel for us (myself, wife and two children) for two nights. The lobby itself gave notice of what was in store for us. We were booked into a deluxe room, which when shown brought my wife to tears. I managed to talk the receptionist (man) to upgrade us to a &quot;superior deluxe&quot; room which was slightly bigger. No hot water, unclean (I am being polite) linen and floors. One has to bend down to walk the corridors of the hotel. Luckily we were out shopping most of the day and were dead tired to notice anything upon return.The hotel is a text book definition of a &quot;seedy hotel&quot;. THEIR CLAIM OF FOUR STARS IS A SHAM....STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.Did not even dare try the complimentary breakfast....had breakfast at the adjacent Saravana Bhavan (most recommended). We checked out as fast as we could on our last day to check into the Intercontinental Grand. Could not stop my wife and kids grinning ear to ear just entering into the Intercontinental's lobby. "
hotel alka ,"I wish I read the reviews before I went Spent 5 nights there, and it WAS a disgrace. I was in tears the moment we got there. The lady at the desk was rude, and just did not seem bothered: she kept answering the phone instead of checking us in. Got to our room and realised why it was so dark....there was no windows, it was small and cramped and no facilities were available.On paper it was 4*, but in reality this place had no class to it at all. The room was hurrily cleaned, the bathroom was worn into and the place smelled of stale urine.The male members of staff just kept staring (its bad enough outside- but in a hotel just adds insult).Our 'complimentary' breakfast they tried to charge for, and the breakfast was a waste of time. Only thing we could have was cold toast and coffee/tea from a dirty thermos. I asked for a banana, but that was too difficult; they cannot give 1 banana as its not on the menu they have to give me a fruit platter as that is on the menu.....?!I questioned whether this was a 4* and was told that they were 'no doubt'. But trust me- I seriously had doubts.Do not go there, even if you are desperate..The only positives things were that it was close to Connaught place- which is good for shoppong/eating and the Vega restaurant had good food. "
hotel alka ,"What a horrible place! We stayed there for 5 nights and I can't say we were very pleased with anything except the Vega restaurant. The staff speak/understand very litle English, our promised (confiremd via email) hotel airport pickup service never arrived and we never got a clear explanation of why... The rooms are small and old. They are also dusty, toilets leak, bathrooms have broken tiles, the tv signals are very poor and often not there at all. Rooms with carpets have a strange smell to them.The staff expected tip for the smallest things like opening the door for you. If you didn’t tip they were clearly not pleased.When ordering roomservice we would often get the incorrect order (due to their lack of english skills). We ordered &quot;Black tea&quot; and got a Blanket. We orderd food with NO CHILLLIES and got food so hot they probably would have had problems eating it themselfs. The phone in the room was of huge annoyance. Either they had disconnected our phone (for no apparent reason) or the phone simply didn't work. At any other hotel in India one gets a decent breakfast consisting of Indian dishes and/or nice continental foods. Here you only get jam, an omlette, 2 pieces of dry toast, warm juice and tea/coffe. 2 extra pieces of toast will cost you 30 Rs. The hotel is gloomey and strangely dark. It is by far luxurious or elegant. I was completely shocked when I looked at their website after staying there - the information is absolutely misleading. How such a hotel can claim to be a 4* hotel I cannot comprehend at all. I have stayed in 2* hotels that are 1000 times better than this. This is more like a 1 * hotel. It would make a good backpackers. "
hotel alka ,"Don't believe the 4* rating! Stayed in Alka for 3 nights, do not believe the 4* rating, the hotel would be lucky to score 2* in any other countries. The room was falling apart, with mirrors all around but no natural light. The airconditionining had to be turned on by ringing up the reception. Do not ask the &quot;travel desk&quot; to put you in touch with an agent, as they will charge you through the nose for a &quot;city tour&quot; consisting of the driver ferrying you from shops to shops where they get commission. While you're at it, try to arrange your own taxis as well as the receptionists only call their chums who charge you through the nose and refuse to switch on the meter. The only good thing about the hotel is probably their vegetarian restaurant, Vega. "
hotel alka ,"An awful hotel In short - horrible location, albeit central, on squalid Connaught place - stay in South Delhi instead. Cramped, dirty rooms with no window and substandard soundproofing. Staff were rude, and were aggrieved when we didn't give them a tip. Avoid. "

hotel apra inn ,"Service was atrocious; creepy place for women to stay My friend and I stayed here as part of a Gecko's tour. Our room was cleaner than the Hotel Perfect (see my other review) but what really was astonishingly bad was the service. The staff were intent on a) getting tips from us and b) entering our room for various &quot;reasons&quot;. At one point one of the staff knocked on our door to tell us they had beer for sale (!). Each time we opened the door they tried to get into the room and I had to stand directly at the door to prevent this. When we arrived we offered the porter the standard tip for each bag that he carried to the room but he tried to tell us that it wasn't enough and even went so far as to take a 10 rupee note out of my hand without my permission! They scowled at any tip we offered for service and when we were in the cab just about to leave for the airport out of the blue they raised the cost of the taxi by 50 rupees! Stay in a nicer place, you deserve it! "
hotel apra inn ,"Best hotel in the area Stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean and the staff was the best. They also had amazing food from room service. Quiet at night as well and close to the markets.Do check out punjab sweets as well. Good hotel, would recommend to anyone. The staff was exceptional. Oh and they also had Wi-Fi. "
hotel apra inn ,"Basic but good value We stayed here for 5 nights in total (spread over three separate visits). It was organized for us as a part of a car and driver trip. It is what I would call a basic 3 star hotel. The room was clean and well serviced. While it didn’t have a window (looked onto an airshaft) it was quiet. Breakfast was included in our package, was served in the room and was OK. Could have upgraded it at an extra cost. Staff were friendly and helpful. The bed only had a bottom sheet and blanket but staff were happy to provide a top sheet.Location is OK. Relatively quiet street with markets at one end of street. A number of reasonable restaurants in the street and internet cafes nearby. Felt quite safe walking around in the evening. Is a 10 minute autorickshaw ride from Connaught Place. Autorickshaw drivers have trouble finding it so make sure you take a hotel business card with you. "
hotel apra inn ,"DISGUSTING DUMP This was the worst hotel experience in my life and I have been to about 60 countries during my travelling time. There was supposed to be an airport pickup in the deal - that did not happen and neither did I get a refund on my taxi fare to the hotel. Breakfast was supposed to be included and that did not happen either. The room had NO windows, the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just a blanket - no top sheet. I was supposed to stay 2 nights but I took a taxi into town and got a flight out of India for the next day. I was charged double the fee back to the airport than the amount I paid for a taxi to the hotel as well and it was driven by someone connected to the hotel. This hotel was listed on an International Hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns about this place and note that they are no longer on that site and for the sake of other unfortunate travellers like myself I am glad at least for that. "
hotel apra inn ,"A good middle range business/tourist hotel This was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company. There was nothing wrong with this hotel, the rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and honest, and the location was quiet at night.I left all of my valuables, which amounted to a few thousand dollars US, in the care of the front desk. I was a bit worried when they didn't give me any receipt but shoved it in a locked draw. No problems when I got it back as everything was still there.It was only about 50m away from the main shopping street and if you need a landmark then &quot;Punjabi Sweets&quot;, a very busy street side eatery, is in the same lane.

hotel aster inn ,"pleasant surprise A clean place,friendly staff , a good place to startAn India tour. Although it was 3.00a.m when we arrived, everybody was extremely helpful. I cannot imagine a better place.A simple but tasty breakfast. Nothing more to be desired[as far as hotels go]. I shall be back soon. "
hotel aster inn ,"Top notch service... We arrived at Aster Inn after staying in the Marriott in Mumbai, and were expecting a massive difference, as the prices were of different leagues for starters, but we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were very clean, the furnishing new and the toiletries provided of a 5* standard. The service was definitely the best amongst all the hotel we have stayed at during our India tour. The staff went out of their way to help us, be it to exchance currency, to give us information about shopping areas and even negotiate Rickshaw prices before we jumped in. There is a kind of homely atmosphere at this hotel, everybody is very accessible and always ready to help. I felt the bigger hotel chains lacked this personal approach and Aster Inn wins outright.The breakfast was always hot, timely and very tasty. The Massala Chai was to die for; we ordered it everyday without fail.I read a previous review about the AC being turned off and I have to say as soon as we stepped back into the hotel, the staff would endeavour to turn the AC back on in our room, without us having to ask. As an customer who is very passionate about eco friendliness, I felt this was a very commendable simple act that could yet help the planet loads in time. I am shocked to think some customers would want the AC to remain on whilst they would be out the whole day..Top hotel, top service. will definitely stay there again when I next visit Delhi. "
hotel aster inn ,"Amazing Aster Inn! I would like to highly recommend The Hotel Aster Inn to anybody considering staying in New Delhi, for any type of trip. As a newly established hotel, we found this to be great value for money. The rooms were nice and clean, true to the advertising on their website. It is well located, within reasonable reach of New Delhi centre (2 stops on the developing Delhi Metro). The service was great. The hotel staff were attentive, and the manager was accommodating and helpful with all of our enquiries. Some minor criticisms though: Hot water – needs notice i.e. run it for about 10 mins! Not so quick on breakfast – can take up to an hour!No internet facilities installed yet, although the Manager allowed us use of his own office facility. All in all, we had a great experience staying at this hotel. I definitely would stay here again if I were visiting New Delhi again! "

hotel aster inn ,"Worst Hotel I stayed at in India! DO NOT BOOK HERE! This place was awful! The location is terrible, possibly one of the worst areas of Delhi. The Hotel itself looks okay until you get to your room... the bed had a bottom sheet, and that's it! No top sheet! I asked for one and got a Single size sheet for a double bed! ?? I asked for a double sheet and got another Single Sheet!! Then I noticed that the bottom sheet had some questionable stains on it, but was told it was clean... I pulled it off the bed and told them to replace it! Finally I get a bottom and a top sheet but had to make the bed myself! And that was the last time I saw a clean sheet for my entire 3 night stay! They don't make up your room during your stay... no clean sheets or clean towels!The Hotel's web site states &quot;Direct Dial Local &amp; STD/ISD/Internet Surfing on request&quot;, let me explain that a bit... Internet surfing is about 3 blocks away at a disgustingly dirty place that provides computers to use for internet activities. Long Distance Calls can be made at the Reception desk... while standing... right beside the front desk in the way of, and within ear shot of, everyone coming and going!Their web site also states &quot;Running Hot &amp; Cold Water&quot;, which is true, but if you want a Hot Shower you have to ask for the Hot water... every morning, even if you asked the night before, you still have to ask again in the morning!Rooms are Air Conditioned, but it is turned off every time you leave your room and you have to ask for it to be turned back on when you get back!!The Hotel does not have a kitchen that I could see, and the food is awful! It arrives on yellow plastic plates, toast wrapped in tin foil, a dead giveaway that this is take out from somewhere else! I had an omelette one morning that was too big for the little plastic plate! I even had to argue with the guy in the dining room abut getting an egg for breakfast, I was told it wasn't breakfast! On asking for advice in regards to storing my luggage at the Railway Station over night so I could take the train to Agra, I was told without a doubt that they no longer store luggage at the railway station but the Hotel could store it for me, and I could even stay at the Hotel for another half day, at half the day rate, when I return to rest up before my flight. Well, that was a lie... the train station does store luggage! The staff are not &quot;Qualified &amp; Trained Staff&quot; as their web site states! I had nothing but problems with everyone, from getting bed sheets to food and at one point someone came to my room, knocked once and tried to come right in... good thing I bolted the door as I was just getting out of the shower (a cold shower!).My room rate was inclusive of breakfast, but when it came time to check out I was billed for two cups of Tea. I was told breakfast does not include Tea! Whatever!Feel free to contact me of you would like more info about the Hotel or visiting Delhi!I was asked to come here and write a good review... there is no way I could say anything good about this Hotel! And just to qualify this review, I stayed in 4 different Hotels during my travels in India and this was not only the worst... but the worst Hotel I have EVER stayed in! "
hotel aster inn ,"Friendly modern and clean Although situated in what was not a great area, the hotel was an oasis - friendly, attentive staff and clean rooms. It was also close to the metro, making it easy to get about without having to shout for a taxi. "
hotel aster inn ,"Cheap but good value for money The location is a bit of a culture shock - but the hotel is a comparative oasis to the bustling and grubby streets that surround it. However, it's only a five-minute walk to the excellent, if limited, metro system. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with adequate showers, and the staff are generally attentive (even calling to ask if we wanted beer...) Breakfast was painfully slow in arriving - half an hour for toast stretches credulity. However, they ironed our shirts in a flash and were generally pretty good. It's not the Ritz, but you it's excellent value for money. "
hotel aster inn ,"5* Service On our arrival at the hotel, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They all went out of their way to help us whether it was directing us to a local hot spot / arranging a day tour to Agra or providing general tourist information. The breakfasts were delicious and the traditional masala tea addictive (room service was efficient!). The location is in the heart of Karol Bagh - great for shopping. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone spending some time in Delhi whether it be for business or leisure purposes. "
hotel aster inn ,"good location excellent room condition great service What I liked - only a few minutes walk from the metro station - the room looked new and well decorated - enjoying air-con and hot shower was no problem, and there was even a fridge! - hotel staff was very courteous, helpful, efficient and speaking perfect EnglishI suggested the hotel to offer internet access. Maybe it will be offered when you stay there =) "
hotel aster inn ,"CONVENIENT MODERN AND GOOD PRICED HOTEL It's very difficutl to find a modern hotel well located in new Delhi. Aster hotel first of all is very modern, the staff is extremely efficient and the location is very convenient ...just 1 km walking from Jandewalan metro station and just one station from famous market (Ramakrishna Ashram Marg metro stop) and 5-6 from Chandi Chowk (historical centre).We paid for a double room 1500 rupie per night. it's not so cheap if you compare to the rest of India but it's among the best you can find in New Delhi! In new Delhi hotel are crazy expensive in Connaught place and not worthed . if you choose other convenient area (the famous Pargaji where everybody goes) the hotels are old and the area is dusty, noisy and old! Do you want to sleep and be conventiently located in a clean environement?! Choose Karol Bagh/Jandewalan area... Aster was our choice! "

hotel balaji deluxe ,Hazzle Free stay Telephone booking is always confirmed whenever I have stayed here. Check-in is smooth. Sevice is good. Breakfast is always complimentary which is a plus. 
hotel balaji deluxe ,"Dont stay here cheap but definitely not cheerful..... We chose this hotel after hours of searching on the internet and reading in books as there is so much choice in Delhi, and we definitely made the wrong choice in many ways. We were only in Delhi for the night as we were flying out to Kathmandu the following morning, and this hotel served its purpose but thats as far as it went.Good - The location is pretty good for the centre of Delhi but is way too far away from the airport - The bedroom was a good size and contained 1 double bed and 1 single, along with a table and TVBad - The hotel offered a free pick-up from the airport but we couldnt manage to get through to them to arrange one. They refused to pay for our taxi when we arrived, and also refused to take us back to the airport the following morning to compensate - The room was very dingy even for night time - The room was very dirty and there were flies and even a cockroach in the bathroom - The area immeiately around the hotel was not very nice and you wouldnt want to venture out the hotel at nightOverallIt may be very hard to rate a hotel when you have been there less than 12 hours but this place is simply awful. It may be cheap compared to a lot of choices in Delhi, but there's a reason for that. Pay a little more and get a better place. "
hotel balaji deluxe ,"Hotel ok but... The hotel is ok as backpacker hotel. The staff is very nice and helpful. BUT be careful not to accept any extra service from this hotel. The hotel offered us to get a taxi for the airport and charged us RS 900 which is what you normally pay for renting the car for a whole day. A prepaid taxi will cost RS 250, Later we learned that the hotel had asked the driver to pay them the tip we had given him, and they told him that we had not payed for the trip in advance. That made us very angry and we shall never recommend this hotel to anyone. "
hotel balaji deluxe ,"QUICK SWITCH TO A FLEAPIT HOTEL This hotel did not honour our booking through Hotels.com on 17 – 20 April 2009. We were travelling with two children, one 3.5 and the other 18 months. We arrived in Delhi at 2 am in the morning of 18 April (the booking was for the night of 17 April). We caught a Delhi Traffic Police controlled prepaid taxi from the airport to the address provided with the booking receipt. The taxi driver could not find the address and took us at 3:30 am to a ‘tourist office’/ travel agent. The travel agent rang the hotel and my husband spoke to the hotel reception, who claimed that the hotel was full, and that we should make our way to the sister hotel – Hotel Ivory Palace in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. At this hour of the morning and with two children, we had no choice. The Hotel Ivory Palace can best be described as a flea pit. We subsequently found out through a travel agent that the room that we were provided was worth $29 AUD or about 1000 INR. We had paid for a super deluxe room (their premium room) with separate bed and a cot for the children at $67.00 AUD a night (2345 INR). We were provided with a room that had:· One bed for all four of us and when we complained an extra mattress was thrown on the floor· Unclean bedding· A hot water system that did not work and after repeated complaints it was fixed on the last day· Strong kerosene odour for the entire duration of our stay· No ‘premium bedding and pillows’· No clock radio· No coffee and tea making facilities· No complimentary newspapers· No housekeeping for all the days we were there· No in-room safe· No refrigerator· No rollaway bedsThe Hotel Ivory Palace was not close to Connaught Place or the railway station, which the Hotel Balaji purports to be. This was the reason I had chosen to book it. We tried phoning the Hotel Balaji Deluxe in the following days, but we could not get through on the number provided on the booking sheet. After unsuccessful attempts to get through to the hotel, we decided that it was a short stay and we should devote our energy to seeing Delhi and getting organised for the next part of our holiday. There was obviously a connection between the two hotels as the Hotel Ivory Palace was happy to take our booking sheet as proof of payment. Our feeling is that if the Hotel Balaji could not accommodate us, they should be obliged to provide an equivalent or superior standard of accommodation, as opposed to the significantly inferior option we were given. The only recompense we received after several complaints was that our room service breakfasts were covered by the hotel (Approx 450 INR). We feel extremely ripped off by the experience. I was trusting that Hotels.com is a reputable booking service and maybe we should have paid more attention to the review “DEN OF THIEVES – RUN FOR YOUR LIFE” on Trip Advisor, as they document the sort of contempt that the Hotel Balaji has for guests booking and prepaying over the internet. "
hotel balaji deluxe ,Budget Hotel This hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi.It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you. 
hotel balaji deluxe ,"It is worthy to go Good place, only several minutes from New Delhi railway station. Marble floor, the staff is nice, asked me for water several times, but finally charge me 50Rs, it's OK. The room is clean, and the hotel price is reasonable cheap! "
hotel balaji deluxe ,"Den of theives! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! We booked a suite thru expedia, selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised. We arrived at midnight, no one was there. We called and eventually we were met by their employee who got us a cab. Certainally we could have walked thru the doors &amp; got a fixed cab ourselves. The driver got lost. Eventually we arrived, gave our itinerary # and we given a small room. We said ours was a suite (2 adults, 1 kid) the clerk waved expedia papers he possed in our faces and said that was our room. No problem, we would get is sussed out in the morning, I was too tired to argue. We showed our papers in the am, the manager said the clerk had bad eyesite. We we upgraded to a slightly larger room. I overlooked the construction, painting in the lobby the luke warm hot water, the roach, filthy blankets I dare not use, all to check out....where the clerk insisted on paying for the lift from the airport. (2x the amount we would have paid if we got the taxi ourselves) I said it was included, and I paid for a suite for 2 nites &amp; only got one, lets call it even. No, he said. Expedia charged us too little, we should not have gotten what we paid for.After 1/2 hour and 2 failed called to expedia (disconnected) I paid as not to miss my connection. So I paid twice the amount for a room and 2x the amount for the taxi. ....and had a lousey stay. Back in Delhi staying at a much much better hotel for hte same cost. Avoid the Balaji unless you want to get riped off deluxe. "
hotel broadway ,Hardly luxury but not that bad We stayed at the Broadway on two separate occasions as part of a recent tour to India. We had two different rooms - one at the back looking towards the mosque and another on Asif Ali road side. This is a reasonably budget hotel located on the edge of Old Delhi. The rooms we stayed in were of an acceptable standard -not exactly luxurious but you get what you pay for. The air-con worked (which in July was essential). The bathroom was clean. We had a friend who stayed in a single room which did not have a window - which would have been a bit depressing. So watch out for that.I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is noisy. If you're at the back you get the call to prayer from 2 mosques. At the front there is the incessant beeping of Delhi traffic. The best thing about the hotel was the restaurant - which has won awards for kashmiri food recently. The bar upstairs was pretty grim though - no window and therefore smelled stale. 
hotel broadway ,"good place It was anice place to stay. You could enjoy a nice place to live as well as a nice location to wander about. So, i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends.We had a great time out there. "
hotel broadway ,"Veeeeeeery noisy... I would never go back to sleep, I would go back for dinner, the restaurant is very nice, the staff is helpful, however the hotel is very old, and being wakep up by the mosque every morning at 6 am is not my cup of tea. "
hotel broadway ,quite surprising It's not a particularly quiet hotel to be honest. We seemed to be lucky in that we got one of the rooms in the back with a view of the Mosque which was entertaining. It's a beautifully furnished hotel and has a certain old world charm to it.The service we received was quite good. We had to leave at 7:30 to continue onto Agra and the staff very kindly gave us some breakfast (we were a bit too early for the buffet breakfast).Thugs Bar is also quite fun :) We wanted to try the restaurant in the hotel as well but didn't get there (going by all accounts its meant to be fantastic!) 
hotel broadway ,"Two weeks at the Broadway I stayed at the Broadway for the last two weeks of July 2008 with a large group. My room was on the top floor, at the back overlooking the Jama Masjid. My sense is that the quality of the rooms varies a bit. The folks in front complained of traffic noise, particularly those on the lower floors. There are also rooms in the middle of the hotel that have no exterior windows, just opaque glass facing the corridor. You must get used to it, because no one seemed to complain about this. My room was lovely. It was very light, small but clean and bright. The bathroom had ample water pressure and hot water, though the shower usually took a minute to warm up. The air conditioning was quite powerful, maybe a touch too cold. It is true that the hallways have no AC vents, but enough cold air vents from the rooms to keep the halls relatively comfortable.The staff were prompt in providing room service, and kept the rooms clean over the two weeks. They did not pester us at all, but that may be because there was no point in pestering a group or because the hotel was full, so they were making money any way. Laundry was cheap, and returned same day, but be careful with delicate fabrics, as most drying in India is done by Iron (and sometimes the laundry did come back a bit damp). The mosque behind the hotel does call the neighborhood to prayer in the early morning, but I found this charming. Sometimes I woke up and listened drowsily before rolling over and going back to sleep, and sometimes I didn't wake up at all. On weekends all of the children of the neighborhood get out on the roof tops and fly kites. From our room we could literally see hundreds of them. Also on the weekends on the street in front of the hotel there is a used book fair. My sense is that if you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive and not in Paharganj, the Broadway is a good bet. The attached photos show our room. There are also pictures that earlier posters added of a room decorated by a French designer who stayed at the hotel. Fear not, almost all of the rooms in the hotel share our decor and not the loud multicolor decor of that room.As for food, we ate breakfast in Chor Bizarre every morning. The breakfast buffet was was more than adequate, though the restaurant was a bit dim for a morning meal. Every morning featured hard boiled eggs as well as either omlettes or fried eggs. Also at least one curry, cereal, toast, juice, tea or coffee, and on some days fried veggie cutlets or samosas. There was fruit juice and they will bring bananas on request. It is true that there was no other fresh fruit, but this is India. We were also fed lunch in a conference room, which gave us a sample of what the kitchen can do. Suffice it to say that lunch was generally excellent, and I'm sure that those eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner would agree. As for the bar, Thugs, yes, it is a bit of a dive. Who wants to go to India to drink?As for location, a tuktuk to CP or New Delhi station/paharganj cost 60 Rs. The Muslim neighborhoods behind the hotel are interesting to walk in, but better to go in a group. I saw no obvious dangers, but one of our more intrepid members did come down with a nasty virus.The Broadway is not the lap of luxury. But it is a solid mid range hotel in the heart of Delhi that exceeded my expectations and is definitely better than most of the reviews here would indicate. "
hotel broadway ,"Disgusted with Broadway hotel Delhi I stayed here in a mixture of rooms for approx 4 nights - 2 nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty, noisy and old so upgraded to most expensive rooms at front which had been refurbished for far greater price only to find out that they too were noisy (as all rooms are adjoining with thin wooden internal door so you can hear everything from other rooms), no hot water for days, sheets covered in human hair. A complete arogance by staff and careless attitude of management when we complained. The bar is seedy as they come, food overpriced and general hotel over-rated. Were going to stay 2 weeks but left after 4 nights. I was sick of being harrassed daily by staff to buy a service from them either a taxi, a tour, a driver etc - even being told it was dangerous to go out alone, rubbish! Wouldnt return here ever, save your money and go elsewhere where they want your business and treat you like a guest rather than an inconvenience. "
hotel broadway ,"jack hammer broadway I read all the reviews and tried to keep an open mind. I have stayed in some hell holes. So I was ready for anything. I was even ready for the bully attempt to make you buy expensive tour packages or when leaving finding added charges you did not make. So we arrived at the airport and please try to remember to go over to the front entrance of the airport ,thats where the taxi they send will pick you up. When we arrived in the lobby everything went smoothly I was so surprise. They took us up to our room where the hall was cluttered with carts I got worried until we entered the room. spacious beautiful bathroom. comfortable large bed.tv. loved it. overlooked the mosque enjoyed call to prayer. The only thing that was not so great was the work that was going on in the mornings the sounds of jack hammers. but after a while you tend to ignore it. the area is rather disappointing but cabs are plentiful. the resteraunt chor Bizarre was very busy and the food seemed more for tourist but there are really good vegetarian places only a few blocks away. I totally would go back ,really enjoyed my stay. "
hotel broadway ,"Hotel Broadway We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Broadway. The room was OK (the view was nice, but the room was quite noisy), the breakfast was great and the staff were very friendly. We ate at the restaurant (Chor Bizarre) several times and really loved everything we ordered, in particular the gulab jamun. "
hotel broadway ,"Common areas look great ...... This hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra. It lived up to most of the reviews - an average sort of place. The common areas were quite clean and attractive, including the breakfast room. The room itself was fairly large, with twin beds, and nicely appointed. It looks like the furniture and fixtures were recevently updated, although the walls were stained. The bathroom shower sprayed a fine mist, but the vent vents into the hallway, so not only is your privacy compromised, but you'll also hear everyone / everything in the hallway. The room was not well insulated, so we could hear honking horns all day and all night as well as the barking and howling dogs. For those in need of English language television, there are about 80 cable stations of India and English language programming. The airconditioner worked, but the heater seemed a bit lacking, so ask for extra blankets if you're cold.The breakfast was pretty skimpy - toast, thin oatmeal, hardboiled eggs, bread, potatoes, artificial juice, tea and coffee. On the second day, fried eggs were also available, as well as cold cereals. The cleanliness was a bit suspect as we saw the staff wipe the used plates and cutlery and replace them on the table ...... using the same cloth that just wiped off the table ! However, perhaps because it was the start of our trip, this lack of cleanliness did not have an immediate effect on our digestive system (that would come later in the trip).We didn't get a chance to eat dinner there, although the guides and drivers remarked that the food was supposed to be quite good.The front desk staff was accommodating in making change for us and made us feel welcome. "
hotel broadway ,"Inexpensive and just OK My son and I had dinner at the hotel's much praised restaurant, Chor Bizarre, in 2004. It was outstanding, a Mughal feast. For that reason I decided to stay at the Broadway on my solo October 2007 visit. I thought I might take all my meals at the Chor.The restaurant was a diappointment. Breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs -- scrambled one day, hard boiled the next -- and few other dishes. The entrees I ordered at lunch and dinner were good, not great.My single room had one window: it looked out onto a corridor. Actually, my two rooms. Without explanation the staff moved me after two nights -- to the room next door.My first room was designed to appeal to a six-year-old. Its curtains were decorated with cartoon characters, as was its bedspread and other items and parts of the room. Since the bed was a single, I wondered if many young children checked in alone.Aside from a bed, the room also had a chair and table (the latter attached to a wall), a small closet, a full-length mirror (decorated with cartoon characters), and a safe.The bathroom was quite modern -- and also very cramped.The Broadway's location is a bit distant from Connaught Circle -- about half-way between Connaught Circle and Old Delhi -- but since Delhi is so spread out, that's not really a disadvantage.A clear advantage is price: having paid between US$200 and US$300 on my previous trip, the Broadway's US$80 rate was quite welcome. "
hotel broadway ,"Great location I've just spent a couple of days at the Broadway. It's on Asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate and is ideally located for exploring Old Delhi,Jama Masjid and the Red Fort. All the drivers seem to know it so you'll have no trouble with directions.I had room 14 - a single room which was windowless. It was, however, clean and the bathroom was well equipped with regular clean towels. It's a bit basic, I suppose, and you couldn't call it luxurious but the downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike. Staff were likeable enough and more than happy to arrange pick-ups and suchlike.Would I stay there again? - mmmmm, dunno. At that price range I dare say it's fair value for Delhi but it was a wee bit characterless. "
hotel broadway ,"It smells bad!!! We were 9 persons staying at this hotel for some days.I booked there because I had read about it in a Lonley Planet Guide, but we did not like it because:- The single room had no window!- Outside our room there was a mosque (very noisy very, very early in the morning!!)- The staff was not very friendly or helpfull.- Yes, the rooms had A/C but the corridor and the lift were hot!- But most of all: Everywhere there was a very bad smell....But when all this is said I have to add that the location was good. We walked in the small streets behind the hotel and it was near several places - we could go by rickshaw or Tuk-Tuk in a few minutes.I will not recommend this hotel - it must be easy to find a better one! "
hotel broadway ,"value for money this hotel was good value, not luxurious but good size room, good shower room, nice and clean, clean sheets and towels, attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice! "
hotel broadway ,"Cheap but not again I got a good price, and didn't have that high expectations. If I had been staying for longer I would have asked for another room. I got a a windowless room, which is the dirtiest hotel room I've ever received. With a cockroach, previous guests hair, dust, and so on. The bed was very hard. And the door had a huge gap under neath so all sounds in the corridor could be heard. There was also a call too prayer at sun rise. I slept very poorly the 2 nights in the hotel. But I've also heard from the other guests that there is a big difference in the rooms. So be sure to check what you get. That said they were very helpful. They organized breakfast before opening hours for me and a tour group. I was slightly worried about eating in the Chor Bizzare restaurant, given the cleaning level in my room. But it was excellent, with very nice staff, and good food. Try the saffron, semolina desert. This was in the hight of turist season with a Indian Pakistan cricket match, and a lot of fairs in Delhi so all the hotels where rather full. "
hotel broadway ,"Quirky clean and comfortable When we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room 26. This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon. Other than that it was pretty shabby. When we had slept and got up to go out of the hotel, the receptionist advised that our 'superior room' was now ready. We were shown to a very smart room, spotlessly clean (room 22) at the front. It felt like we were in a different hotel. It's worth checking to see what room you are in. The road outside however, at the front, was really noisy. Vehicles going all night. On balance it was a great place to stay. I can't comment on the value for money as it was part of an inclusive deal. The restaurant was good, always busy, you need to book yourself a table. Breakfast included a choice of hot food and the usual toast, cereal etc. The staff were a little stiff (in that slightly brusque Indian kind of way) but after a couple of days they were really friendly. Prices for the phone and room service were cheap, i'd expect to be paying over the top in Delhi. "
hotel broadway ,"Not a good experience I booked this hotel after reading the one good review on tripadvisor and reading in various guidebooks that this hotel was a good value. I disagree. Although the hotel succeeded in providing us with a reliable pickup at the airport (we then used that driver for our tour of the Golden Triangle) for what we paid we did not get a good value. The hotel placed us in a room that was next door to a room that was being gutted. This meant we were woken up at 8:00 am every morning while we were on holiday by hammering, men talking, and sounds of drywall and plaster coming down three feet from us. After looking into the room next door, it was apparent that we were sleeping next to potentially unhygenic conditions, there was a pile of trash, drywall, plaster, and cement blocks in the room.Breakfast was less than desirable, the restaurant was dark and gloomy with a buffet that was questionably fresh. Suprising coming from such a highly rated restaurant, Chor Bizarre. Needless to say we did not eat dinner there. The area is convenient for sightseeing around Old Delhi but honestly it doesn't matter as you should hire a driver while in New Delhi to alleviate yourself from the frustration of traffic and getting ripped off by taxis and rickshaws.Overall we would not return to this hotel. The hotel room was clean, but given the conditions of the room next door (two feet from our beds) I would not pay US$100 for this room. It was worth perhaps US$30 at the most. "
hotel broadway ,"Great little hotel Stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi, after reading good reports about it in the Lonely Planet guide. Its very close to the Red Fort, and Chandni Chowk ( a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life.) The rooms in the hotel are clean , with air-con, and very good bathrooms. Times of India delivered to your door every morning. The front desk changes money at a reasonable rate. The famous &quot;Chore Bizarre&quot; restaurant lives up to it's name, excellent food, wine and service!! There's even an antique car on which breakfast is served from! The &quot;Thugs&quot; bar serves just about anything you can think of. It wasn't the Ritz, but a very good value 3 star hotel. I paid about £20 for the room and a decent breakfast. All in all, a great little hotel. "

hotel chand palace ,"cheap nice enough..... its not 5 star accomodation but its nicer than some of the others the shower rooms/toliet isnt like a hotel one its more like what ud have in ur bathroom........ I think the best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys, the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels. Location is not too bad either everything u need is reachable which a short walk its just round the cornor from a train station where u can catch trains too places all round india a good place too go from here thats not too far away is agra where u can see the Taj Mahal "
hotel chand palace ,"Hell on earth The hotel is filthy, the staff are all dishonest. The Manager is even worse than the staff, I am used to travelling in India, but this hotel and any in its group are to be avoided.Room service tried to charge 200 INR for 2 bottles of coke (menu price less than 40 INR)Sandwich 600 rupee, menu price 65 rupee.We needed a room on our return to Delhi, the manager promised to upgrade us for the one night, the room in in the nearby Yuvraj was just has filthy (someone's period stains were on &quot;clean sheets&quot;) The upgraded room is listed as 1200 rupees on their website, the manager tried to charge 2800 rupees. there is not a hotel on that street that charges over 1500 rupees per night.Avoid this group like the plague. "
hotel chand palace ,"Do Not Stay Here! Do not let the reception fool you, we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there. The room was dirty and smelly. We got ripped off due to taking the services offered by the hotel and the one time we got food from the hotel we couldnt eat it as it wasnt cooked right! On a more positive note there was security in the hotel and once youve stayed here anywere else will seem lovely. "
hotel chand palace ,"This so-called hotel is awful I had to stay at Chand Palace in April 2008 for 5 days before I left India after a 3 month stay in New Delhi. You will see a lot of dirtness all over Delhi but you should expect that at a place where you pay that much money. The room itself - with a window which was too small to see the wall on the otherside of the &quot;street&quot; - was some how clean but the bathroom was a disaster. The basin was broken, the water was so strange that you couldn't use it for brushing your teeth - it's the only place I have seen where you can't even use the tube water for that purpose - the only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it, you will have just one winter blanket, which is useless for temperatures like 20 to 30 degrees during the night. Beside that, you should take some earplugs with you otherwise you are not able to sleep because of all that noise.The food was like the street food 20 Rps. which you can get everywhere in Delhi but here you will be at least 100 Rps. Furthermore, we you check in the hotel and ask for the price of the stay, then do that in a written form. I asked the desk manager before my check in and at the end it was nearly the double of the price. If you really want to enjoy that beautiful country and city than choose some of the other, less expensive and pleasent and really nice hotels - I mean one of the houses that is worth calling it a hotel - in New Delhi.

hotel chand palace ,"Terrible in every aspect We stayed there for 3 nights in January.It was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays...:-No daylight-VERY loud-Dirty -Very cold (no real windows).-Slum-like neighborhood-No hot water (we actually paid for hot water)-VERY unfriendly staff-Very expensive in comparisonAt the checkout they cheated with the account.So, just stay away from this [--] hole and look in Lonely Planetfor decent rooms...Regards,Christoph "
hotel chand palace ,It was terrible and dirty Dirty!! the staff is always spitting. Noisy. 
hotel chand palace ,"Terrible slum Dark dingy room with leaking toilet, wierd unfriendly service, yellow dirty cold and smelling &quot;shower&quot;/pipe water. Stayed only one night thankfully, was worst night of 4month trip, even the hotel's own driver rips you off (400rps to conaught place via an unwelcome stop at his friend's restaurant!). Place accross the 'street' is a falling down firework factory...take care! If you are used to any sort of basic comfort then stay somewhere in southern New Delhi, not Paranganj! Positive reviews must be from hotel owner or staff, this place is not remotely acceptable even to a backpacker, certainly not at GBP20/night in India! We stayed in many other places in India, and hence I know how poor quality this places is compared to others around the country. Don't be fooled by the front desk, these places seems to spend their whole budget on the lobby alone! "
hotel chand palace ,"Total Dump Dirtiest and filthy place we had ever stayed, expected better in the capital, Holes in the wall with area around the Air conditioner open, noise, cold air and polltuion of delhi can be well savoured here.Place was dirty, we changed room 3 times in 2 nights, hot water problem, not on till the reception want a shower.Room smelt of Shitand Urine, may be the Delhi aroma as all Indian ciites now a days. POLLUTION.Fake reviews may be from locals not from poor foreigners who are conned into these hotels. Even the ELECTRIC SWITCH IN THE BATH ROOM WAS HANGING OUT OF THE WALL. hEALTH &amp; SAFETY IS -zeerroo- "

hotel chand palace ,"One night no problems I stayed for one night here and found it fine. Nice staff, good location, my ride to the airport came quickly and was resonably priced, the phone worked, as did everything else in the room. There were a few creepy crawlies in the bathroom but they didn't bother me! I would stay here again but next time I go to India I will be on a tighter budget and this will be a little over. "
hotel chand palace ,"RUN from this place! Terrible location. Very dirty. Broken toilet, broken and filthy fridge, and broken air conditioner. Rooms smelled like dead fish. Don't even think of a good nights rest here. "
hotel chand palace ,"One of the best hotel Loved It I stayed three days in this hotel and found that this place was remarkable with best staff. I recieved warm welcome at the airport with the pickup and the hotel was very nice and loved it so much. This hotel consulted me a tour which was great recomended by Raman who runs Akshat Tours and Travel, I would recomed it to all my travel minded friends... "
hotel chand palace ,"Hotel Chand Palace-poor Having already booked with Expedia, I was expecting worse when I read reviews such as those atandHowever, I had only paid the minimum rate for a room and I did have a window, a fridge, a TV, my own loo (which leaked) and a fan (the noise of which was very necessary at night to blank out other noises. There was no hot water, the room was dirty (but not crawling!), and many fittings were broken. There were a lot of (friendly)staff who never a seemed to do anything unless you actually gave them the bin to empty.It was just about OK for me, but I could not recommend it unless you are desperate to save your last dollar "
hotel chand palace ,"dirty building site This is not a nice hotel. It is basic but not at all clean. It is currently undergoing building work and together with hotel being built next door means there is constant drilling, welding and hammering from early am til late at night. The room was damp and the carpet crawling, literally. The food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but if you need some sleep, forget it. Also, room had no windows and broken AC unit. "
hotel chand palace ,Friendly Hotel I stayed in Hotel Chand Palace 2 nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests and i will recommend this hotel to my friends.Gerard Luzi 
hotel chand palace ,Une séjour plaisant 
hotel city park ,Lovely Place The hotel is amazing n i m impressed by d management of staff..Food quality is too good..the hotel is well built n neat &amp; clean place to hang out and for function purposes also 
hotel city park ,"Lovely hotel great service though not centrally located I stayed here for 4 nights with my family. The rooms are big and clean. The service is absolutely fantastic. One morning we left very early to travel to Agra and the staff made sure there was breakfast available (even though the kitchen was meant to be open yet). We ordered room service one evening and the food was with us after 10 minutes and was delicious!The buffet breakfast was included. It was pretty good - selection of hot and cold dishes, Indian and Western. Also, they russle up a great masala omlette!I didn't use it but there is a decent looking outdoor swimming pool.On the down-side: not much of a business centre (1 computer and a fax/printer!) and not centrally located. "
hotel city park ,"Pretty Good Stayed here for the final 4 nights of my Delhi trip. The Modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the Metro link nearby is good. The rooms were very nice. No problem with the mentioned pigeons, room on 7th floor overlooking the park. The Cafe 24 restaurant was quite good and I found the breakfast very satisfactory. The Bar was quiet and nice for a quiet drink in the evening. There was not a lot to dislike bar the overpriced Internet Access which was also very unreliable. The area around the Hotel is not great with some very poor dwellings situated close by. Saying this there was no feeling of danger while walking the area. "
hotel city park ,"Never Again In the middle of nowhere. 45mins into delhi town, just feels like a lifetime with the taxi drivers.American breakfast!!!!!!! Have I got it wrong, do Americans now have curry and ommlette for breakfast.?As I was there on business I required internet access, this was unavailable for 2 days and when it was available I learnt that the whole of the hotel has only purchased around 9 hours for a 15 day period! I was aware that internet was chargable so was surprised to learn that the maximum logon was 43mins.Swimming pool was unavailable.Restaurants consist of 1 with 2 menus, food was not greatBar area was so dimly lit it was like sitting in a mine with no atmosphere.Staff not very helpfull.Expensive in comparison to many others in better positions.Left a day early, I would not recommend this hotel and if my PA was not my wife I would sack her "
hotel city park ,"Great Place To Stay The place is lovely, the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive.The only other issue was the expensive internet connection "
hotel city park ,"Peaceful haven in Delhi! City Park is a modern 7-storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi. To get the negative out the way first, it is a bit isolated, but it is easy to order a tuctuc or taxi. However, as the name suggests, there is a park opposite, so views from many rooms are quite relaxing, which counts for a lot in somewhere as manic as Delhi, and of course that also reduces the street noise. And it is easily accessible by the main routes in and around Delhi. This hotel is easily up to 4* European standards, close to 5*. Rooms are very large, the beds soft, the aircon quiet, the bathrooms well equipped and clean. Welcome cake, water and fruit a nice touch, particularly after a long flight or drive. The Chilli restaurant food was really very good, plentiful and reasonably priced at about £3-4 for a main dish, but the beer very pricey, £3/bottle, 50% more than most restaurant prices, and the service we received was a bit slow and staff seemed completely thrown because we changed the number of people on our reservation. There's a pool in summer, which is welcome. The extensive banquetting facilities also give an indication of the hotole's quality. Great for a stopover or a few days. "
hotel city park ,"Poor Location But Clean Clean rooms, seemed far from the city, decent breakfast and good gym (for India). Basic business hotel. We stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks and each time the Internet was down which was pretty annoying. "
hotel city park ,"Sleepless night We stayed for one night at this hotel on the first leg of the Golden Triangle tour, therefore this hotel was booked for us by our tour operator.Much to our disappointment, the hotel was a good 1.5 to 2 hours drive from the centre of Delhi. Some members of our Group had previously arranged to eat out in Delhi, but this would not have been possible. There was nothing much to do in the vicinity of the hotel.We ate in the hotel restaurant. The food was very nice, though terribly expensive even by London standards.The biggest problem we had was that of sleep (or lack of). After travelling for around 36 hours and with only a few hours sleep on the plane, we were hoping for a good night's sleep here.During the night, my wife and I thought someone was on the balcony trying to break in, until we discovered that around 10 to 15 pigeons were sitting on the balcony banging against the bedroom window.A bigger nuisance, however, was that a wedding was taking place at the hotel that night and at around 11pm they congregated in the car park below our balcony. They played drums and trumpets loudly until 2.30am. At midnight I called reception asking to change room, but my request was denied (only to find out in the morning that other guests had moved rooms during the night).The following morning we complained to the staff at reception who were totally disinterested in what I had to say. They offered to change our room.....even though we were in the process of checking out!Breakfast might have been good, but I was in such a grumpy mood that I couldn't possibly comment on it objectively! The butter was rock solid and was unspreadable- that's about as much as I remember.I would not stay there again. "
hotel city park ,"pleasant hotel in dubious area We stayed in this hotel twice, one night at the start of our tour, and then again just before we were due to fly out of Delhi. On our first visit we were put into rooms on a lower floor, and the pigeon problem others have mentioned wasn't too obvious. However on our final night we were roomed on the 7th floor and they were a thorough nuisance - flying into the windows, and constantly moving around during the night. The area around the hotel is not one that you would feel safe exploring, though lots of people seemed to be socialising quite happily in the park across the road. The hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing. We got a map from reception and realised that we were almost off the map of central Delhi. Like us, most of the guests seemed to be on tours and they only stay here briefly. A previous poster has mentioned dirty carpets - I think we must have stayed in the room after them as our carpets had obviously just been washed and were still a little damp. However - there are lots of pluses for this hotel. We found the staff pleasant and trying hard to be helpful. They did get overwhelmed at checkout time, as all guests are being picked up together. The staff in the bar were really nice, though we found the drinks pricey on Indian standards. The coffee shop downstairs was a pleasant place for breakfast, plenty of choice, though we didn't discover that eggs would be cooked to order on our first visit - just ask and the chef will appear. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel - as long as you are using it as a brief base you will find it quite adequate for you needs. "
hotel city park ,"Depressing setting This was part of the Golden Triangle Trip (so Hotels booked for us)&amp; we had stayed at The Oberoi Maidens, Delhi for 3 nights at the beginning (which was excellent) so this Hotel was depressing, by comparison-even though the food was fine.There was nowhere to walk to -the Cinema &quot;complex&quot;next door was bleak &amp; semi derelict. There is a slum just next to it (with, we were told, Bangladesh refugees) with sludge/sewage/junk on the pavement - so it seems a bit spoilt of us to complain about the Hotel-neverthelessthe carpet in the bedroom was covered in stains. It also felt a bit malevolant outside-as men were being sleazy (to me-a female even tho walking with my husband in daylight) &amp; it was very noisy at night with shouting/car alarms &amp; pigeons/dogs (as others have said)..A highlight was an Extreme Sport chipmunk which sky-dived down from the roof of the Hotel Tower block &amp; swam across the swimming pool! "
hotel city park ,"Rude Unfriendly Staff Bad Breakfast Annoying Pigeons on Balcony The tour company (Hi-Tours) put us in this hotel for two nights. We had stayed at another budget hotel in Delhi on our own where we had a good experience (Silver Ferns). The City Park is totally remote, far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for a cookie store and an optical shop. We did not feel safe when we walked in the neighborhood. Our room overlooked a rubble filled parking lot behind the mall, and the balcony was full of loud pigeons cooing and pooping everywhere. Dogs barked tor hours in the night. The staff was rude and inefficient. I waited in line for 15 minutes to pay my bill on leaving because the person in front of me had questions about her bill. Six employees devoted all of their time to her and totally ignored me except to tell me to &quot;have a seat.&quot; The breakfast was tourist oriented and the service was slow. The room was adequate but I can't recommend this place for anyone. "
hotel city park ,"Great for a brief stopover This hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didn't have any choice in where we stayed, but we weren't disappointed. We arrived in the evening, having spent most of the day travelling up from Goa, and the day had been a bit fraught due to delayed flights and the possibility of missing our connection (which we didn't, thanks to tremendous efficiency by Kingfisher Airlines staff). The hotel was clean, comfortable and had the best bed out of the 5 hotels we stayed in during our 2 week trip.Because we arrived quite late, we didn't bother to go out but just had a few drinks and a snack in the hotel bar. Food and drinks were okay.On the down side, there were pigeons on the railings outside our window and we were woken up at 4 am by what sounded like tap dancing - it was the pigeons being restless. The swimming pool looked nice although the water was a bit cloudy. Some people might also be put off by the fact that the pigeons were also sitting along the edge, having a bath in the water!Breakfast was good, although for a country known for its tea, I wasn't impressed - far too weak and wishy washy!The one problem we encountered was a small visitor in our room. I saw something scuttling along the floor and thought it was an insect. My husband saw it and realised it was a small mouse - on the 7th floor! The hotel staff were amazed when we reported this but hopefully, they dealt with it as soon as we checked out. "
hotel city park ,"Lovely Hoetl We stayed at City park as part of a tour around india. I have no idea how much it costs but it terms of decor and space it was brilliant. The rooms were big with all modern ammenities. It is quite far from the very centre of delhi but you get taxi's everywhere anyway. The manager was very friendly and made sure we had a good time. Just be aware that everyone wants a tip, just say thank you and close the door. Nice hotel. "
hotel city park ,"Nice hotel to stay in and to get a great exp. A 4 star hotel having all the 5star facilities and amenities at a great price,will love to stay here again on my next visit to delhi, staff was very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gud,and food was excellent specially yellow chilli......an indian restaurant...... "
hotel city park ,"I recommend City Park I was booked at the Jaypee Siddarth; however, despite having a confirmed reservation, I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel. I am glad. While it is not the most centrally located, the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional. I will definitely stay here again and the prices are reasonable - a rarety in India where hotel prices are unreal. "
hotel city park ,"Lovely to look but beware..... We found ourselves at the City Park for one night in between internal flights in India. Hotel space in Delhi is at a premium so we were glad to get a central(ish) room in a supposedly good four star hotel. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming, spacious and well laid out. The staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly. Our departure next morning was early and we had to be at the airport for around 6.00 a.m. so the car was coming to pick us up at 5.00.We had our young daughter with us and didn't want her to travel on an empty stomach so we made arrangements for a small breakfast before we left. We were assured it would be there. Their full breakfast, which we had paid for doesn't start till after 6.30. When we arrived downstairs the following morning the cafe was shut and the manager wanted to charge us for providing a sandwich from room service to take with us. All they would provide was a cup of tea or coffee and toast and bits of fruit There was no flight information which a lot of hotels (4 star and upwards have). In short no one cared.So I would say looks can be deceptive and if you don't want to be done - avoid this hotel. This is a 4 star hotel with 0 star customer care standards. "
hotel city park ,"pleasant oasis in the suberbs A little way out of the city centre and set amid tumble down houses and shops, this hotel is an adequate stop over. It has two restaraunts and a spa. (the aruvedic massages are cheaper then in Kerala with a one hour massage for 600 inr plus tax). The hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite which provides a pleasant area to walk without the hassle of New Delhi streets. Unfortunately open public urinals line the side of the street and the smell can be over powering on a hot day. Rooms are well appointed and the beds are comfortable. "
hotel city park ,"Great Hotel - Far Away This is an excellent hotel. The front desk staff were very good, the food was good (breakfast was fair, but the dinners were excellent), and the room was clean. Laundry service was prompt and very good as well. It is just not in a very good location. It is very far from the main part of the city - it took me 1-1/2 hours from the airport, 1-1/2 hours to meet a friend at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, and 1-1/2 hours to the Baha'i Temple. I spent a lot of time in a car on the crazy roads of Delhi. There is wireless Internet access in the rooms, but its is very slow, and I had to sit near the door to get a signal. "
hotel city park ,"Too Far from the Main Delhi Attractions Expensive If you are looking to do some sight seeing in Delhi, do not stay here, its in one end of Delhi (extreme North) far from the main attractions and you will get far better services and grandness with hotels in South/Central part of Delhi at lesser or comparable price. Its lobby and public areas are far smaller than most other 5 stars in Delhi and is located on a relatively smaller street in front. The distance of Delhi's main attractions like Lodhi Gardens, India Gate, Bahai Temple, Old Fort is atleast 20Kms from here and you can end up spending a 1-2 hours to travel in peak hours (one way). The only place which is closeby (relatively only) is some of the Old Delhi attractions about 12-15Kms from this place but then its the same from the hotels in Central/South Delhi as well. There is absolutely no attraction around this hotel.This hotel also has mind boggling banquet business where marriages/family functions are organized making it a nuisance for the residents because of the noise and people which frequent in 100s all on a single day. It has atleast 3-4 banquets halls.This hotel is located in a North Delhi residential area while most of Delhi's other good hotels are located in posh south delhi localities. "
hotel city park ,"city park we stayed here as the 1st night of our golden triangle tour. it wasthe best of the 3 hotels we stayed at - very clean, good rooms, and good service. the breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected.it was overall excellentand i will definitely sty here again on my next visit to delhi "
hotel city park ,"A sound hotel with an excellent restaurant We stayed in 5 hotels whilst in India and this was one of the best. It is very much a hotel catering for the business traveller, however, if you want to get into the centre of Delhi it will take around an hour due to the shear volume of traffic.The rooms are clean, are well decorated and a good size. The restaurant was excellent and probably one of the best we ate at in India!!There is also the usual facilities at the hotel, Gym, swimming pool, 24hr room service etc.A previous review of the hotel commented on &quot;tipping&quot; and staff holding out their cupped hands. We didnt experience this at this hotel, however, it is a very common trait in India.No real complaints about the hotel. "
hotel city park ,"Do not pay to sufffer - Never Again We were on a World trip in April through to June 2006. We saw this Hotel rated as a 5 star and recommended by all major airlines. Whilst in the Hotel, we were advised NOT to drink the water, let water when showering enter your mouth, eat washed fruit or any salads. Strange for a 5 star which should have had water purification.All staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages, not tips. Other people we met in the Hotel had the same experience. All staff were underpaid yet room rates were from US$200 per night. One would bring 1 towel, get a tip and return with a helper and another towel and want more money for his return PLUS his mate. Then flowers, then soap, then more bottled water at US$4 per bottle. We met several others with the same experience and they paid more than us.Tthe owners ate in the restaurant and when they did, all staff left us and other guests and served he owners who did not care. I saw the owner's wife order six drinks in succession as she just changed her mind, sent the untouched drinks away and was so rude to the staff I could not but interupt and tell her off. She said we could leave the Hotel if we did not like it. How rude! as she was just so disgusting and I have not seen animalss treated the way she treated her staff.Everything organised from the Hotel was upwards of 5 times the price of anywhere else. they were renovating with jackhammers from 6am up to 10pm every night and regardless of complaints, ignored us and other guests who were lined up to complain.I felt sorry for the staff who tried so hard, but the management despised their guests, and their staff.I wrote to this Hotel and the Airlines who recommended it because I want to make sure others do not pay to suffer. Not even a reply.Never again!Marcus "
hotel city park ,Ottimo e bellissimo 
hotel clark heights ,good value for money i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai. First i was very hazy about where she is staying. after reaching there we have found that safe and nice pl;ace. in the main city off course nosiy like Delhi. Under one roof all the services available for the travelers. From Pick Up to Drop.I would recommend to every one 
hotel clark heights ,"Adequate rooms friendly staff but beware of being ripped off! The rooms in this hotel were adequate though super super deluxe far nicer and more spacious than lesser rooms. Not great value for money and very noisy due to construction work and the busy road outside. Staff on reception were nice and friendly, with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis and double charged us (service charge) for booking train tickets to Amritsar. We were also told that Delhi was closed on a Friday in order to sell us a trip out of Delhi, when in reality it wasn't! This gave us a bad impression of the hotel as a whole. "
hotel clark heights ,"Don't stay at this hotel. Rooms were ok, but everything else was terrible about this place. The staff changed their pricing on us many times (and of course, they over charged us). They don't have a restuarant although they say they do. Instead if you order something, they will just find it on the street and bring it to your room. Every person you see in the hotel expects a high tip for doing nothing. They say they have internet, but it is the computer they use at the front desk. Overall, this was the worst place I have stay at in India and the price was one of the highest. "
hotel clark heights ,safe place We booked 10 rooms for the marriage purpose for three nights stay. Hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement. This was very near to our house and the marriage location. all aur family members came form different parts enjoyed and cherish the stay over there. 
hotel clark heights ,Average hotel but lots of hidden costs We stayed at Clark Heights for 5 days in November. Original my boyfriend and I were given the wrong room - we had paod for a super deluxe but they put us in a delux - after arguing our case they graciously put us in a much better room. Some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for organising taxis with the hotel (including a car to Agra) and service charge on train tickets were high. Recommend to get Rickshaws than use their taxis. Overall a noisey but average hotel. 
hotel clark heights ,"Poor value for money This hotel was nothing special. Firstly, it is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site. The rooms were basic. The reception staff were helpful, except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar - she ripped us off and then told us we were untrustworthy when we refused to pay charges that she hadn't told us about. This was after she had told us that the whole of Delhi would be closed on one of our days there, which we found out later wasn't true. There was always someone available to drive us places, though at an expensive cost. All in all, we weren't very impressed with this hotel and if you do stay here, don't book any trips without negotiating the price first. "
hotel clark heights ,Seepage in the Room Paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling. We do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers. 
hotel clark heights ,No Limit for cheating. I book room from internet. No pick up and no refund. 80 Kms. small taxi for 15 Rs. 1 km. cheating travelers coming for 1st time to india. High price hotel/ guest house.

hotel clark heights ,"Love the hotel location I was there in months of september with my father. I would like to share my views abouth clark heights. I personally feel this hotel is good for those people who visit first time in india bcoz here, I found very helpful and caring people and they helped me in my further tour as well and very well organized by the hotel staff. The rooms are very nice and specious I love to give **** star for this hotel. Only problem with our taxi driver that is he was to fast.I like this hotel bcoz of the location of the hotel in on the main road and they have there own parking facilities plus market is also very near to this place. Here, Reception staff is extremely helpful and well behave... "

hotel clark heights ,"Noisy The hotel was clean, room mid size.No pick up at the airport. Very noisy all night.Staff was nice location was ok; we prepaid 250 IR for a car taxi from airport "
hotel clark heights ,Truly home away from home. The experience at clark was better than any five star hotel I v stayed in and I v stayed in many as I m a flight attendant . The rooms are way bigger n nicer than most. The staff was incredibly attentive and caring .(especially to my kids who did nt want step out of the hotel as they were so at home there.) The food was divine. and they took every care to cater to my kids' special 'out of menu' orders. All my out of town tours to Amritsar n Agra were very well arranged.The only thing I think They could improve upon is the toilet ameneties and external facade. 
hotel clark heights ,"Constantly mislead me I arrived in Nov in Delhi with my family. We booked hotel clarck online because it was easy. As expected we were picked up at the airport. The rooms were not as nice as the photos online, at all. We arrived late so had little choice. the y cheat us badly......... "
hotel clark heights ,"Wrong Presentation I booked this hotel on a friend’s recommendation and after looking the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is not clean 25 % of what it is displayed as. The staff is just eager to sell you tour to Agra and Jaipur. There ware small insects in the room, the bathroom has a foul smell. The hotel is on a busy road so we had no sleep the whole night. Charge is quit high compared to the services. We do not recommend it to any traveler from USA or Europe. "
hotel clark heights ,"It's completely of the type i would prefer...... I enjoyed a great 2-days stay over there with my colleagues. The interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment 2 the hotel staff too because they managed it very well. The service is really upto the mark and moreover, what I liked the most is its location. I mean its too easy to get to other places from here which was our prime requirement during that trip. And, getting all this at so reasonable price is none less than a pleasant surprise. Infact, I am looking forward to more stays in CLARK HEIGHTS during my future trips to Delhi. I would definitely refer this hotels to all my friends....:)) "
hotel clark heights ,"Excellent service pleasant and helpful staff Warm ambience Hi ,I visted india in month of aug, with few freinds fro a wedding, Since we wanted to stay closer to central delhi and were on abudget , we chose this hotel.Good value for money.The staff was courteous , freindly and very helpful. The rooms were nicely done and clean. The late night coffe shop was a blessing for us due to late night at wedding function.The staff even helped us in getting few things that we had missed to carry along.,They even got our gifts packed in a very elegant way.I would recommend thsi hotel to all my friends from US. and would definately go back and stay ther.e everytime i visit Delhi.

hotel clark heights ,Run Away Many time you think for the best but you get nothing and you get bad experience yes I had a bad experience as the room given to me was very dirty and towel was smelling.I booked this hotel from internet as the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good. Big ManMushtaq 
hotel clark heights ,"AWSOME HOTEL I went to india last month for a business trip and stayed at Hotel Clark Heights.It was a wonderful experience.Room was immaculately clean, the bedding and pillows were heavenly , the bathroom and dressing area was very nice, and a separate space for an office desk and chair.. A lovely hotel. All staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant.Enjoyed my visit. I would definitely go back. "
hotel clark heights ,"Excellent hospitality and food We just returned from a 6 nights stay at Clark Heights hotel at New Delhi. Being from India, I am much familiar to the issues which some hotels in India have and I must say, both my wife and I were thoroughly pleased with the service and the room that this hotel provided us. It is in a crowded road, but accessible to the mero which is about a km away in walking. The best part of this hotel was that it was very clean and the bathrooms were sparkling and fresh. The double delux room is a bit small, but we found it quiet, as it was the corner room for us. The room service and special requests were immediately taken care of. The other thing which we thoroughly enjoyed here was the food. Since we had a six year old son with us who we have not trained to eat spicy food, we asked the cook(chef) to make sure that there is no spice. That was always complied with. The menu is mostly North Indian food with some Chinese and Continental options also. They even packed sandwiches for us in the early hours(4am) of the morning when we were to go to Agra. The food was so tasty, that at times while sight-seeing in Delhi, we used to head back for lunch to the hotel just to have the food. (There is a famous four-start hotel in Connaught place whose restaurant refused to make food with no spice, so we had to walk out). The basement retsaurant is used for lunch and the roof is now made into a roof-top restaurant and the open-air was very pleasant. We can see the metro line and the moving trains from the roof-restaurant, something my son enjoyed. My only wishlist is that the hotel must tie up with a more reliable cab-service, we had some concerns with the car on one of the days(got an inexperienced driver once - a bit dangerous for Delhi traffic, so we stopped the car after couple of minutes and got another reliable driver whom we stuck to), but otherwise pickups from airport and drops went on plan. Overall, a good experience and if we visit Delhi again, for this price, it is a good stay. "
hotel clark heights ,"Decent Hotel Great Staff This is decent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar, but it is on a very busy intersection, so be carefull to while booking room. Do not book room by metra side, or you will not be able to sleep. Hotel staff was very good. I had an issue with my rental car and I had to call 1000 KM away and my cell phone gave up because it was changing network. Receptioninst lady gave me her own cell phone to use as it was early in the morning. Accept one minor incident of overcharging by room service(This was corrected by front desk right away and they apologized so I will believe it was just a mistake.). Rooms are clean, bathroom is great with international standard and property is very clean. "
hotel clark heights ,cleancomfortable and friendly. First time in India and after a poor night in Mumbai I was pleasantly surprised by the Clark Heights hotel. Convenient to the Delhi Metro I found no difficulty getting around.The hotel room was clean and well appointed with a flat panel TV. 
hotel clark international ,"just a small lodge not a 3 star hotel The rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered mostof the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowingtoilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; thehotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentifieddripping in each room during the whole night); and the breakfastcutlery was not clean. "
hotel clark international ,"In Delhi you often get less than what you pay for and at this hotel .... much less I had a 26 hour layover in Delhi, ugh, and I wanted a hotel that was clean, with Wi/Fi where I could crash for the night. This hotel has wi/fi but it is not what the photos portray. The photos that the hotel uses for promotion totally fail to capture what you get at this hotel. Go to Tripadvisor for photos of those who actually stayed here. This hotel is very old and run down. In the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb. There are stains on the sheets which show that cleanliness is not part of this manager's mentality. The fuzzy TV works but the remote doesn't .... I hope you are getting the picture. The words that come to mind are: grimy, tacky and overpriced for what you get. Finally, outside, where the hotel is located, is blighted, noisy and remote. Conclusion... there has to be better property's for just a night than this. "
hotel clark international ,"Really enjoyed i been to this hotel in this month only, and find it worth it for money, check-in take just 3-4min to get our rooms, housekeeping manager is really helpful, all the staff members are really nice n helping . even there travel desk is very helpful for us.Awesome nad enjoyable trip!!!! gr8t memories "
hotel clark international ,"Average The hotel is located in a very busy, noisy and rowdy area. For those who love shopping, it is ideal. However, the staff are curteous and always at one's service. The rooms are neat, the food is satisfactory. The Tour company Abyss Tours lived up to expectation. On my next trip, God willing, even if i don't stay in the hotel, i will still employ the services of Abyss Tours. "
hotel clark international ,"Very Clean Comfortable and Firendly The hotel is well positioned, the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us.Rafiq Khan who operates through the hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged for us to have a driver for the say to enable us to see all the sights in the safe knowledge of having a car waiting for us.Lovely friendly people and I owuld recommend both the hotel and people higlhly to all. "
hotel clark international ,not recommended The air con make so much noise that you can’t even get a nap for 5minutes not recommended. Room is ok but all fixtures are old. 
hotel clark international ,DO NOT COME HERE “OVERPRICED” FOR ITS QUALITY A normal hotel which is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight. They took $70 from me which is overpriced for the service andthe kind of room which was given to me. Why I am saying this becausewhen I went to a nearby hotel(this area is full of hotels). I got amuch better quality and service at 40$ had they given me good andclean towel (they took 30 minutes give me dirty towels) probably Iwould have not checked out and came to know the difference. 
hotel clark international ,"Excellent budget hotel in Delhi The hotel arranged to meet &amp; collect us from New Delhi Railway station at 6.30am, and we were transferred efficiently to the hotel. Check in was friendly &amp; efficient &amp; we got a free upgrade. The room was spacious enough, everything worked fine &amp; the included breakfast was very good. I would highly recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi. "
hotel clark international ,"Not Worth It This hotel is in a very busy are. There are many hotels nearly. Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good. We checked out ofthe hotel next morning and the reception took 30 minutes to check usout. The bill was not ready and excuse was that there is someconfusion. If I had a flight to catch, I would have missed it. "
hotel clark international ,"Open lobby... This hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator (who walks about the hotel giving the impression he is a hotel employee) who attempts to sell you a golden triangle tour for a very high price. Of greater concern is the fact this man somehow manged to find what room we where in, and infact made an internal telephone call to our room to attempt to arrange to meet us to sell his tour services. I wonder if the hotel is taking a commission for this? He was present in the hotel lobby bothering the tourists on all 3 days we where there. His office is around the corner from the hotel, and he will attempt to take you there to do a hard sell. Despite this negative first impression, the food was great as was its price, service could be better. Hotel pick up was relaible. Front of house staff attentive, but aloof at times. Air conditioning was not working in our room and it took over 2 hrs to relocate us. The drains are very smelly and the room had a musty smell to it . Generally clean and well presented. No window in either room so no natural light. "
hotel clark international ,"Decent Hotel Good Location This hotel was just fine. Its a little pricey but then so are all hotels in Delhi. We arrived having booked in advance and check in was very smooth. In the first room given the toilet leaked so we asked to move. This was not a problem as other rooms were available. The second room was just fine. Rooms are on the dark side but they are clean and comfortable with satelite TV, Air Con and a Fan. Also we had a fridge which is always nice in such hot tempretures. Hot water only worked in the morning. I like the neighborhood of Karol Bagh. Its in a local Indian Market for Sarees mostly so its interesting to walk around and you dont get hassled too much (comparatively). I always felt safe here. The metro is a 10 minute walk if you want to get around independantly. Also there is always a AutoRickshaw Driver to hand to haggle with. You are close enough to all the attractions by these transports. I would recommend this hotel. "
hotel clark international ,"A lotus in a market and traffic pond As i am aregular visiter to delhi due to metro project, this time i made the booking through web and finaly landed to clark which is located in a busy street, But was realy surperised once we enter, it was really cutting you from outer busy environment to clean atmosphere where you can easily relax in clean rooms, staff was realy helpful, free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really a big advantage, will visit again in november, thanks to there hospitality. "
hotel clark international ,"liasoning with wrong people Me my wife stayed here for a good 3 days good. Rooms were not that bad but not that good too. Breakfast was average. High price for hotel like this, they have arrangement with bad travel agents and they took almost more than double price for a tour to agra, jaipur. We know from our friends who did same tour in quiet fewer prices, car and hotel were same. Rippled off. "
hotel clark international ,"More than you Expect Our travel agent booked this hotel for 1 night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book 1 more night directly at the front desk who were very polite,gentle and helpfull always...Next day mor ning after our breakfast we were planning to get around the city but had no idea what to do in an unfamilliar place at the same time Mr.Chokerborthy introduced us with a man in the lobby named Mr.Zargar who arranged some part of our trip around Rajasthan for 10 days &amp; got to see alot more in such a short time.The service is ok &amp; most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes.Breakfast in the morning could be better with some other choices but no complaint at all we got what we asked for.I recommend this hotel for any travler bcoz they do care for others no matter how old you are. "
hotel clark international ,Friendly clean and safe Airport pick was very helpful. Little expansive but Delhi's hotels are expansive compare to other cities. Use travel sites to get good deal. 
hotel clark international ,"Excellent Oasis in the heart of the New Delhi' We had previously experienced a great rooftop meal here- and decided that we would stay here on this trip to Delhi. We weren't disappointed! We got a very good deal/rate through Expedia to spend a week at this great hotel. The rooms were small but well presented and exceptionally clean- complete with comfortable bed, wifi and complimentary toiletries. The rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts (recommended the on-demand omelettes and coffee) and no fuss late evening meals/refreshments were delicious.All staff were attentive and helpful- any small niggles were dealt with efficiently with a smile.The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Karol Bagh district of New Delhi- a fantastic place to get a feel for real street life. With a large local market at the end of the street and the superb Suruchis (thali) restaurant only two streets way we were never stuck for places to discover by foot.Highly recommended. We will be back. "
hotel clark international ,"Wonderful Stay I booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay, which included an airport pickup. First i was bit worried about the airport pickup but was glad to see a car to pick me up at the airport, however had to pay the driver extra to turn on the AC. The room was clean (though small in size) including the linen. The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater. Will definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay.And yes the bed is amazing! "
hotel clark international ,"good and clean i stay 3 nights and person of the hotel was very nice , and the rooms are very clean , food good too... The travel desk of the hotel very helpful &amp; friendly Mr. Rafiq &amp; Mr. Haroon. "
hotel clark international ,Really helpful staff and central location The staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to. The room while not large was still well kept. I was also pleasantly surprised by the open rooftop breakfast area/restaurant. I got to Delhi by myself and the hotel provided a free pickup at the airport and I felt pretty comfortable in and around the area as a single female traveller and was only later joined by my friend. 
hotel clark international ,"The smells noise and heat of Delhi with the bliss and escapism of the hotel. Fab hotel - possibly a bit pricier than some in Delhi - £30 a night, but a lap of luxury when off the plane, and trying to find your feet. Very comfortable, great food, but mostly, excellent service and friendly! "
hotel clark international ,"Nice Hotel; Grotty area My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in August 2009 and were pretty pleased overall. The hotel is lovely inside, the room was spacious, the A/C worked, the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were more than helpful. The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India.The only thing that lets the hotel down is its location. Karol Bagh isn't a clean, Westernised area like the areas that house some of the 5 star hotels; it's dirty and congested and there's a good chance of stepping in something unpleasant as you leave the hotel.The nearest Metro station is only 5 minutes walk away though and it's only a couple of stops to Connaught Place "
hotel clark international ,"Great value hotel lovely rooms - peace in the mayhem of Delhi! This is great little hotel which has great value. Breakfast is included in the price and is very good. We had food in the restaurant one evening and despite being the only ones there, the food was very good! The rooms were really comfortable and clean.We booked to stay there again at the very end of our trip and we got the most gorgeous room with a bath and fabulous shower. Loved this hotel - location is not the best but would definitely stay here again. "
hotel clark international ,"Top value in a good location We are sat in the foyer as I write this review. We are only staying for two nights and booked on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. It represents excellent value at around 20 pounds per night. The room isn't quite as spacious as the photos suggest and are well used. The room is clean and the aircon works (a must in Delhi in July). If you are used to 3 star European hotels you may be a little disappointed with the first impression, but things are different in India!The staff are numerous and very helpful. The restaurant is very good. As the previous reviewer points out, the breakfast is a little strange but they make a good omelette. For dinner we had an excellent mixed tandoori for two, which with lashings of (very strong) beer came to around 6 pounds each. The best curry sauce I've ever had!The district is lively, with miles of streets with small shops and street vendors. It's noisy all day as all drivers seem to beep constantly. Be prepared to have to haggle for just about everything! It's assumed (I think) that tourists are very wealthy and will pay anything!In summary - this hotel provides an excellent base for exploring Delhi. "
hotel clark international ,"Would recommend for the price Stayed at the hotel with wife and 3 year old and got a king size bed as asked for. Room was a decent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary. Had breakfast at the hotel and the choice was a bit of a let down, had spicy noodles and pasta amongst eggs and toast! But for the price we paid you couldnt complain. The area around the hotel is very noisy and if your a light sleeper like me then that will be a problem, my wife though was fine. The upside of this is that there is a good market at night in the area for some shopping. For food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the area as when we asked for directions he said its 5 miles away and a 100 ruppee ride. We happily declined. In short you could pay a lot more in Delhi for not much more. "
hotel clark international ,"not great but good We booked our stay at Hotel Clark International before we left home which turned out to be smart because we met other guests who said that they booked by going to the hotel once in Delhi and they were charged double what we paid. Overall, my b-f and I had a good stay here. We got free pick-up from the airport and the hotel was in a good location, but the drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the a.m., they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didn't drink, and phone calls were pricey. One of the major pitfalls against this place was that the staff wasn't all that helpful. When we asked if they had a map of the area we could have, we were told to follow a man in the lobby who would get us one. We were then taken to a travel agency who tried to talk us into booking tours to Agra and sight seeing around Delhi. They also charged way more for a lift to the airport than a taxi actually cost. Our room was spacious and clean (although the washroom was a little dingy and the TV was broken). The bed was comfortable and the AC worked. The breakfast that was included was ok. "
hotel clark international ,"Excellent Choice We were a bit concerned over the mixed reviews, especially of those who booked their rooms via Expedia and subsequent problems they encountered. The Expedia rate is almost 1/2 the price of the published rack rates, so it was hard to resist!We booked (and prepaid) via Expedia a premium room. Our international flight was due to arrive at 12:30AM but was over an hour late. I had reconfirmed our flight arrival details with the hotel along with our room reservations about a week before we were due to arrived.We were very pleased (and grateful!) that the hotel &quot;boy&quot; was smiling and waiting for us at the airport and whisked us away to the hotel. Check-in was a snap, with only a quick stop at the front desk so they could photocopy our passport info then off to the room.We could not be have been more pleasantly surprised. The bed was awesomely comfortable, the room, (on the 3rd floor) was clean, neat and modern. Plenty of hot water. The tiny window provided no view, but hey, who comes to Delhi for the view?Breakfast was included in the rate) and was satisfactory. We also ate dinner there the first night and it was very good. Watch out for the high alcholic content of the Kingfisher beer however! It is a real kick in the pants:) It's not in the polished area in Delhi, but an interesting neighborhood with a colorful market. It's only a couple blocks from the metro. The autorickshaw drivers in the area were a bit annoying but that's Delhi.You will need earplugs. I think earplugs were invented specifically for India. Between the barking dogs and honking of horns, it's a wonder anyone gets any sleep!If you look for an good value hotel in Delhi, and don't want to spend over $100.00 a night, this is an excellent choice. The staff was polite and helpful, but not effusive. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return here. "
hotel clark international ,"Value for money I booked the Hotel for a stopover before my international flight. I was coming from Goa and got the Hotel details here in this site. After deciding to go for it , I got a reservation through hotels.co.in for a Premium Room+Airport Pickup+Internet for US$36. That was pretty good I think . I although my flight from Goa was delay the boy from the Hotel was there waiting me and took me safely to the city. The place is busy, but the hotel seemed nice at first. After I checked in, the boy took me to my room and as soon as he opened the door I noticed it was a standard room. Immediatly upon calling the reception and explaining that my booking was for a premium room the moved me. The room was nice and clean, but the bathroom although clean was a bit run down. The food at the restaurant was ok and the breakfast, although simple, was ok too. They charged me INR$600 to take me to the airport the next day.Anyway, it was all right ... and the price was ok, so I think I can recommend the Hotel. "
hotel clark international ,Centrally located Gud option if you are travelling on a tight budget 
hotel clark international ,"A welcome sight after travelling! We booked our stay her for the first few nights in Delhi and then wandered around looking at some of the other hotels in the loney planet but nothing was a patch on this one so we ended up returning two more times! The staff were always welcoming and there was a real sense of safety. We booked through Expedia and then directly through the hotel for the other two stays. Expedia was half the price of the published price but the hotel happily gave us the same rate for our other stays. The rooms were clean with LCD TV and really comfortably pillows! (The rooms on the 3rd floow seemed a little more modern than those on the 2nd) There were no windows in the cheaper rooms. Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant and is included in the price. The hotel is situated in a busy shopping area with coffee shops, Pizza Hut and McDonalds nearby (just in case u get a case of Delhi Belly as we did!) There are also loads of other local choices. When booking travel use the agent across the road from the hotel, he really looked after us and was nearly half the price of the guy hanging around the hotel lobby! There's an internet cafe nearby so everything you need! Easy to catch a rickshaw a travel around. Would definitely recommend! "
hotel clark international ,"So-So I had a few occasions to stay at the hotel once in sept 2008 and once more in nov 2008. There are a few things that i liked about the hotel and few that probably, in my opinion was a little bit of a let down. The things i really liked : room ambience, room cleanliness, hospitable staff, top floor open air restaurant, proximity to market place and metro station, food(taste). the let downs: room service - sometimes took ages, food was little spicy,lack of variety in food choices, AC- almost non functional, room size, tv(still CRT) in some rooms. I noticed the lack of variety in food since i was staying for a longer period of time being on a business trip..for ppl staying overnight or just for a day or two, it might not be bad at all. I could see lot of foreign tourists stayin there...If someone is looking for a decent acco in karolbagh area , would recommend to try this one. "
hotel clark international ,"Great modern and low cost with exceptional service My sister and I staye dat this hotel for a business purpose. The staff were amazingly friendly and very personable. They assisted us in all aspects of our business helping us with leads, the hotel stay and anything we needed. We were two single women in Delih so they were very helpful and assisted us in travel.In addition they have free WiFi and a conference room where we were abl eto use it all day for interviewing stayy. They never questioned the time in the conf room and were very helpful.the rooms were clean, very modern, on the small side, but perfect. Being british travellers, we are always cautious in travelling to India and yet this was a good cost hotel with great cleanliness and quality.The restaurant has a great breakfast incl, but closes early at night. Theed in a great spot right close to the Coroba market. We had also forgot one of our suitecases at the hotel and they immediately sent a driver with it to the airport - we did not have to worry about loss or theft! A hard find in India! "
hotel clark international ,"A Home away from Home-Will Stay Again. During my recent trip to India, I &amp; my husband stayed at Hotel Clark International at the at the beginning, middle and end of our trip at New Delhi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel especially because of the very friendly, accomodating &amp; warm behaviour of the Hotel Staff. I had choosen this Hotel based on all the online reviews, good, bad &amp; ugly, and had decided to find out more on my own, and I can say I am very happy that I selected this Hotel. I was especially happy because of the in -room Safe, the mini bar &amp; the Complimentry Tea/Coffee, Breakfast, &amp; airport pick ups &amp; drop of.

hotel clark international ,"Good location ok hotel My wife and I spent three nights im the Clark International in February 2009. The hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at 6.15 AM, but claimed that the hotel boy had been there and that we just hadent spotted him. Might well be, but our theory is that he was there to late as we were out of the airport allready 20 minutes after the plane arrived.No problems though with a pre-paid taxi from the airport to the hotel, were we arrived arround 7:30. The reception fixed a room to us and we could sleep for a couple of hours before starting off for the city. The room was on the 3rd floor and held a lower standard than what we had expected. Later in the day - after complaining - we got another room (on the 2nd floor) which was more spacy and modern. Both rooms were clean and free of any kind of bugs.The Clark International is located in the Karol Bagh area which is quite convinient as it is close to the new and rather impressing metro. The metro will be increasingly important in Delhi. Karol Bagh also hosts a street market which is quite charming. The market starts just a block or two away from the hotel entrance.Karol Bagh is a busy area with a lot of small shops, some hotels and the streets are crammed with cars, rickshaws, cows and street vendors. Quite as it should be in a Delhi neighbourhood. The hotel was definately the most expensive we stayed in during our 16-day India tour. Delhi has a lot of very expensive 5 star hotels, and its not easy to find good options in the 3 star segment. Clark International turned out to be a good one. The only negative thing we can come up with is that there is some noise from the streets and the surroundings. (This by the way occurs to all the hotels we stayed in in India). When we were there demolition works were going on in a building near by and that created a lot of noise starting quite early in the morning. "
hotel clark international ,"Put us into a I booked the Hotel Clark International directly via their website.. The hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation. When we arrived in Delhi from the airport at 1:30 am we were told the hotel did not have a room for us, the hotel was fully booked. They never mentioned this to us when we called from the airport for our transfer.They said they would put us up into a &quot;sister &quot;hotel down the road. The Hotel Surya was awful... We were so tired from the flight and it was in the middle of the night we just slept in the room in our sleep sacks.Thankfully I had the insight to buy them. The next morning as we were flying to Varanasi my wrist started itching and I noticed I had small red marks, bed bug bites. I booked the Hotel Clark International so our first night of our 21 day trip to India would have a smooth start. it was anything but that..I was charged the same quoted rate even though we stayed in an inferior hotel, something I would never had booked. I could not recommend them due to this poor customer service. I felt I had been ripped off with their bait and switch.. "
hotel clark international ,"Satisfactory Hotel if a little over priced We spent 5 nights in total over 2 different periods at the hotel. We stayed in an Executive room though we were upgraded free of charge to a Premium room for one night.We paid £86 per night for the Executive room. This includes airport pick up, breakfast and complimentary wi-fi. I think this is slightly expensive though hotels in Delhi do appear to be expensive.The room was of reasonable size and very clean. It had a TV, a mini-bar (the contents of which were expensive) and tea and coffee making facilities.The bathroom was clean. My only criticism of it would be that in the Premium Room the shower wasn't in a separate cubicle which meant the bathroom floor got very wet everytime we had a shower.Breakfast was buffet style. It included cooked food of different types each day, cereal, toast, juice and tea and coffee. We also tried the restaurant one night and one afternoon. There was a good selection of food on the menu and it was very reasonably priced. Indeed the food itself was very nice. Mind you the waiter isn't very friendly unlike the other staff in the hotel!!The Hotel is situated in the Karol Bagh area and indeed is less than a 10 minute walk to the Karol Bagh metro station which is convenient for getting around the city. When walking to the metro station you pass through a very colourful market which is present on certain days.Unfortunately there was a lot of street noise at night whether it be vehicles or dogs barking. The noise was particularly noticeable in the executive room which was on the first floor (the premium room was on the 4th floor and was a bit quieter). However I would imagine street noise would be a problem in many hotels in the city.The area around the hotel is slightly rough. One thing which I didn't like was the hassle we got from touts the minute we stepped out of the hotel. However this was a problem no matter where we went in the city as was begging.The hotel appear to work with a nieghbouring travel / tour company. The staff from this company appear to sit in the reception area and wait for guests. On my first morning in the hotel the minute I got out of the lift I was approached by such a person who gave me the whole selling routine. This person was very persistent to the extent he was travelling up and down in the lift clearly looking for us. In saying that we did book a guide for Agra through the company as well as a pick up and drop off to the train station. The guide was very good indeed and we were glad we did go ahead with the booking.Overall we were pleased with the hotel. It is lovely inside though slightly expensive. "
hotel clark international ,"One star status budget Accomodation It was their third offer of a room before we decided it would get no better. First room had creatures crawling around the shower floor. Second room offered had blood on the towel.The so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve wine(we had to locate/bring our own) and the roof of same is lined with bamboo, above which numerous pigeons reside, dropping feathers etc into one food while dining. Only one of our party(of three) was sick over a five day period, but we spoke to another resident whose friend was confined to their room for a couple of days with food related problems.Tried to charge for a non appearance as one of our party coming from Thailand to meet us in India had to alter booking(due to Bangkoks a/port being closed) only refunded us after several days of verbal discussions/culminating in our having to remind manager of our post holiday review intentions.Most definately would strongly advise against booking this establishment. "
hotel clark international ,"Tiny overpriced Our room was very small with a heater and A/C unit that looked like they were made 50 years ago. The TV was also dated.The staff were not friendly but capable enough. They organised a free pick up from the airport, but this was a dusty 15 year old tiny car. Luggage would not fit in the boot and had to go on the front seat. They organised a lift to the domestic airport for the 450 Rupees in a slightly better small car (but not much). The plus points are a nice restaurant up on the roof, with a very nice breakfast. "
hotel clark international ,"Not that bad at all but greatly overpriced For CAD215 (USD 180) a night, greatly overpriced, like all hotels in India. The good: conveniently located in the quiet street of Karol Bagh, 5 minutes walk from metro. Nice rooftop restaurant. The bad: heater in the room didn't work properly. Electricity outlets were so outdated that small plugs (cell or photo charger) required support to stay plugged. Hot water was in fact just warm, so shower in the morning was challenging. "
hotel clark international ,Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel on the 19th Dec for 2 nights and we had booked 2 rooms. We got complimentary airport pick up which was great. Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised we had got an upgrade on both the rooms which was nice to hear.The location is great for all the tourist sights. 1 thing i would say is dont book taxis from the hotel reception as it is a little bit more expensive than a normal taxi.Considering this hotel is a 3 star budget hotel i would say it was very good. I stayed at a 4 star in Mumbai and it was awful!Good value for money and if i was to go back to Delhi i would stay here again. 
hotel clark international ,"Very Nice Hotel This hotel is really nice, situated in one the best areas in Delhi, which is Karol Bagh. You just come out of hotel, then right and when you hit the main market street, turn right again and at the end of that street you have metro station Karol Bagh which it will take you to the main attractions or close enough to spend a fair amount on a auto rickshaw from there.Hotel staff is very helpful, and polite. We never used the pick up service from the airport because we always reached this hotel from the train stations. We raised this concern with hotel receptionist and he provided us with a courtesy drop off service to the airport instead. The food from the roof top restaurant is pretty decent and poison free. We never had meat as in the rest of India but saw lots of people eating meat and nobody complained or looked sick the days afterwards. This hotel is on the same area of others which look more economic like the Royal Holidays and the Hotel Classic but compare to these other doggy places this is far above in all aspects. You spend more but you receive quality in all senses, while on these other places, we stayed our first night in the Royal Holidays, we never could sleep as there works in progress in front of the Hotel and since we arrived they were trying to push us to make deals to visit using their touts what you can visit on your own. They just think that people are stupid and have not read enough before going to India.Here is all the opposite, taxi prices if you request one are reasonable, help is as much as they can, advices, internet free compare to others that try to charge you with 100 rupees for a crap connection, there shops in the vicinity and there is the great market on the street heading to the metro station.Definitely If I get back to Delhi one of these days I will stay here again and can recommend it to any one. "
hotel clark international ,"Decent enough hotel for a short stay Hotel is a bit dated, and shows it in places. The hotel room we had was ok'ish. Mostly clean. The one big negative point was the aircon unit just above our heads over the bed and I mean literally just above, see picture. It was excessively noisy during the night and at one point spewed out a whole lot of built-up black grime from the street.The rooftop terrace would be nice if it weren't for the heavy smog of Delhi. Otherwise the food and drinks are decent and reasonably priced.Stayed there for a night, just before flying back out of India, so didn't get a chance to explore the area. It did look quite lively with street stalls at night. "
hotel clark international ,"""we love being care"" It was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel, the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night The hotel was good and clean, Hope fully i get what i payAs i fall ill was taken care of the staff with medicene food and service etc which touced my heart, may god bless them all, will recommend this hotel to everyone. "
hotel clark international ,"good hotel in crazy delhi excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi.... karol bagh is a hustling area, but nice to have a quiet hotel... very friendly and helpful staff!! "
hotel clark international ,"worst hotel ever stayed in I would like to explain firstly that indian hotels are not of the quality you find elsewhere. That is a common theme i found throughout my stay in india and all travelers must bear this in mind before they travel there. However I was very shocked as to the state of the room especially baring in mind the positive reviews on trip advisor.The room was of a relatively nice size. However the room I stayed in would have gotten a 1 star anywhere else. There were very big cracks in the walls, the room was dirty. The airconditioning unit was very grimy, the bathroom was very shabby, the bath was cracked. All in all i am sure I could have found a hotel for the price I payed in am much nicer room. But i loved being in delhi such an incredible stay and it barely dampened our stay. "
hotel clark international ,"Haven in New Delhi My husband and I stayed at the Clark Hotel in New Delhi both at the beginning and end of our trip to India. Overall our stay on both occasions was excellent. The hotel is well priced, conveniently located near the Metro line (Karol Bag stop), provides airport pickup and drop off, rooms are modern, clean and spacious (large comfortable beds, in- room safe for valuables, nice bathrooms), front desk staff are helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty, a travel service is available in the lobby which can arrange a driver and tours of the city. The overall atmosphere is very friendly and staff are competent and readily provide assistance. New Delhi can be a daunting experience with so much traffic, noise and confusion and so having a place to stay such as this makes the visit so much better. We found Pankaj, Rajesh and Ekta to be especially helpful and hospitable and would readily return on another visit. Staff do their best to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel for visitors to New Delhi. "
hotel clark international ,"Great! We regularly stay at this hotel. On a budget this hotel is great value. The rooms are clean and modern. The staff is very accomodating, in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk. One of its main attractions is the location, right at the heart of the maddness. Love it. Mrs Shah UK "
hotel clark international ,"Hotel Clark treated us awfully My partner and I have just returned from a holiday in India where, as part of our itinerary, we had pre-booked our first two nights at the Hotel Clark International in Delhi through Expedia, for which we were charged £40.70 per night - a lot for India, but we wanted to ensure our first nights were comfortable.As part of our booking, we had requested the free airport pickup to the hotel, advertised on the website. We received our confirmation and were looking forward to our stay at the hotel.However, on arrival at Delhi International Airport, there was no one from the hotel to pick us up. As a result, after lots of trailing around the airport in the middle of the night, we managed to find a driver who was prepared to take us to the hotel in the city (at an extortionate rate).On approaching the city, I phoned the hotel to get their exact location. I was first told by the receptionist that we only had a reservation and not a booking. I informed him that we had prepaid in full and that I had a full confirmation voucher from Expedia.He then told me that, yes, we had had a booking, but they were no longer able to give us a room, and had decided to put us up in another hotel nearby instead. We were utterly dismayed given that we'd spent a lot of money on the first nights of our holiday to avoid this sort of hassle!Given it was so late at night, we asked for directions to the alternative hotel - Hotel Blue Sapphire. Although we were told this hotel was of the same quality as the Hotel Clark International, it turned out to be pretty awful . It certainly was not near the quality we'd be led to expect from the Hotel Clark International.Until now. our experiences booking through Expedia to date have been an entirely positive experience - but this was a nightmare. At best, Hotel Clark International messed up - at worst, they scammed us into taking a cheaper hotel, and didn't honour a prepaid contract. "
hotel clark international ,"Well priced all that you need In Delhi you get what you pay for. When I'm here on business I pay around £200 per night compared to Hotel Clark's £35 per night. It isn't the most luxurious hotel in town, but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town. Well worth the money. Dinner and beer in the rooftop restaurant good and reasonably priced too. Breakfast is pretty boring though! Hotel will normally include a pickup from the airport. I saw some negative comments elsewhere about Abyss Travel. They are the hotel's &quot;travel agent&quot; for car hire etc.. If you don't want to use them, don't. You're not under any pressure to! "
hotel clark international ,"Excellent Hotel in Crazy Delhi. Look, its simple, unless you want to pay £200+ per night, then you will struggle to find a quality hotel in any big city in India. So reviews about this hotel saying mediocre, decieved or overpriced, ignore!! these guys did not do there homework before getting here. The Hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of things,clustered with back street markets and is extremely lively. Yes, the area is not the cleanest, but 75% of Delhi is like this. We based ourselves here for 5 nights, the rooms are clean and well maintained. The food in the roof top resurant is excellent and the staff really friendly.If you want to see, feel and smell Delhi and thats probably why your are visisting this city! then stay here. "
hotel clark international ,"Very good experience The rooms on the fourth floor are very nice. We had a so-so room on the first night , and then we heard that the rooms on the fourth floor were better and so we moved up for the following night. It was great. Spotless, crispy white sheets, a clean modern bathroom. Breakfast is good, the view outside is great. The hotel collaborates with a travel agent named Haroon, who is excellent. He made various bookings for us and we found him friendly and reliable. "
hotel clark international ,"Over-priced Mediocre ... Well, it would be unfair on my part to discard this property altogether but at the same time I am unable to find justifications for having it at No 14 on TripAdvisor’s popularity index. Let’s start from 0:0 to the last whistle i.e., the moment we checked out. Check-in was anything but smooth. Despite having an explicit pre-paid reservation for two adults and two kids (6, 4) front-desk was insistent to have 600 INR/night for extra bed. Breakfast was not at all impressive … yeah even taking room rates in account. Bathroom standard should have been better. TV was not working, there is only 2-3 channels tuned in … we never tried to tune in more nor did we complaint, to be fair. Room service was prompt and efficient. Wi-fi was complementary and of acceptable speed. To conclude, I would say that you don’t really get value for money at this hotel. I am not satisfied, let alone impressed. "
hotel clark international ,"What a shock but a good one in the end I have been to Delhi 4 times in the past two years due to my hubby working out there. This time we were on holiday, I booked the Clark International via there web site which was so easy.We arrived in Delhi late at night, the hotel car picked us up from the airport, when we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel where I had stayed previously. We appeared to have arrived in downtown Beirut but once inside the Clark International I was presently surprised. We were taken up to our room, which was lovely, the bed was very comfotable with crisp clean sheets, air con cooled the room very fast and a great hot shower.The next day we got went up to the top floor for breakfast which had everything you could want to eat with a great view. We then went for a walk and headed down to Connaught Place to do some shopping, when we arrived back to the hotel later that afternoon we realised we were positioned slap bang in the middle of the market district of downtown Delhi, it was great, it had street markets, lovely people, great places to eat and shop and a great carnival atmosphere until late into the evening. I couldn’t believe that my hubby had been to Delhi so many times and never found this area. I loved the hotel and loved the area, next time I go to Delhi I will stay at the Clark International.TIP: Take a card from reception when you travel about as we found a lot of taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was as tucked down a side street, the card has a map on the back with address and phone number. "
hotel clark international ,"excellent value this was our first time in Delhi - we wanted a not too expensive but well kept hotel - and the Clark International conformed to our expectations. Clean, smallish but well-kept room (with noisy a/c) friendly and helpful staff.The area is noisy and colorful, which we rather enjoyed. no bad surprises. recommended. "
hotel clark international ,"A winning combination My brother and I were returning to India after many many years to discover the origins of our parents. Our mother (Tess) was Indian and our father a British soldier. I was born in Devlali and left as a baby.It was therefore important that we had good accommodation in Mumbai and Delhi. And certainly the Clark gave us this.The staff at the hotel were very helpful; the rooms were great and the breakfast second to none. Several times we also had lunch which was very nourishing. If we needed any help with minor things that can usually go wrong on holiday the staff acted quickly and efficiently. We found that they had a winning partnership with Abyss Tours which many other car operators must envy in Old Delhi. The pick up and drop off at the airport went smoothly and we negotiated very competitive rates from their able and competent manager ,Arif, for a sightseeing tour and a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Altogether a very satisfying stay. Congratulations to both teams at the Hotel and the Abyss.Raymond RaineUniversity Senior Lecturer UK "
hotel clark international ,"Don't ever use Abyss Travel Bed ok, bathroom passable, meals passable general staff attitude ok. The major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel...they are a joke, so see through makes you laugh. All the old tricks...obvious plants lies, lies lies. It's a shame that a &quot;could be good hotel&quot; has to associate its self with, and promote, Abyss Travel. Please don't take us for fools. "
hotel clark international ,"Great value in the heart of things! This little gem is right in the &quot;horn honking&quot; center of things. My room was small but clean and comfortable. The staff were all very kind. There was a bit of an internet snafu when I first arrived, but the manager stayed with the problem until he got it fixed and I could get online. I could walk to all sorts of shopping and the hotel has easy access to taxis, etc.There were several tour groups staying in the hotel while I was there...so book early, the secret is out about this one. "
hotel clark international ,"good value the hotel is in the heart of new delhi in a non-touristy area.be prepared for a different culture, but do not be afraid of the neighborhood. free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food. the bed was comfy and the room was clean. you may need to use ear plugs at night because of dogs barking and autos honking. if you do not use the free ride from the airport, you can use the free ride to the airport. the hotel price was okay; not too pricey and not too cheap. "
hotel clark international ,"4* quality at 3* price A really recommendable, clean, friendly hotel with all mod cons (inc wi fi) in a busy - though not exactly central - part of town. By Indian standards it's very fairly priced too, so book well in advance to be sure of getting a room. "
hotel clark international ,"A great find and good value for your money! After reading several reviews on-line, we booked the Clark International for 2 nights. We were very pleased with this hotel and believed we got very good value for our money. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and were very happy to assist in arranging drivers, tours or train travel at competitive prices.They have a cute roof top restaurant. Good Indian, Western and Chinese food, and a &quot;business centre&quot; where you can check your internet. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and we highly recommend it to others.Any inconveniences of this hotel were very minor:1) Like many of the places that we booked on line, it said that our room included free airport pick up and we requested this through Expedia, but it did not happen. So, if you would like airport pick up, double check that a driver will actually be there to pick you up.2) Hotel is located in a busy market area. I was happy to not have to walk alone outside of the hotel at night. The street noise could definitely be heard in the hotel rooms (as is the case throughout Delhi) so bring earplugs!3) Totally my own fault, but I left my sandals in the hotel after I checked out and went back the next day to get them but was told that they had been &quot;thrown out&quot;. So triple check your room when you leave! "
hotel clark international ,"very good value hotel Efficient, good value hotel. Reception staff not particularly helpful or friendly but efficient. Included breakfast was good, and Nepali &quot;head&quot; waiter very friendly. Evening meal good value and good. Room was clean, quiet and secure. Had coffee/tea making facilities which is unusual. Also minibar with reasonably priced drinks, including water, which is useful if you have just arrived from the airport. Efficient pick-up from airport even though plane was delayed. Handy for Metro. "
hotel clark international ,"Little Gem Stayed on two occasions in Jan. One night at first then 3 nights after a 6 day train journey.We were met by friendly courteous staff, they helped us to locate an ATM on the first stay as it was a little daunting in this very bustling city. The rooms were clean,the bathrooms had bath, shower, all very clean, mini-bar &amp; air con,TV and free internet connection. There was some traffic noise but unavoidable in such a busy city and no fault of the hotel. The breakfast was very satisfying,cereals,hot foods, eggs etc. Lunch and snack &amp; dinner menus varied &amp; were very nice and the waiters very nice,helpful. We would recommend this hotel, it was quite a &quot;little gem&quot; considering the price of some hotels in New Delhi, we would stay there again should we return someday. As we didn't take advantage of their free hotel pick-up on our arrival in New Delhi, they kindly gave us a free drop off to the airport for our departure. "
hotel clark international ,"Highly recommend the Clark International New Delhi Have just returned from a week based at the Clark International New Delhi. Our rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day, bed linen was changed daily, hot water was plentiful (though the wet room style bathroom was a little inconvenient), staff were extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. Restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good. Room service excellent. The only downside was that the location was a little rough, as a party of four women travellers, we did not feel particularly safe stepping out alone and we were glad that we had booked the services of a driver for our stay. Would highly recommend the Clark International hotel as being very good value for money. "
hotel clark international ,"Good moderately priced hotel We stayed at the Clark Hotel in July, 2007. My husband is Indian, but not from Delhi, and we really didn't know much about hotels in the city except that there seemed to be very few moderately priced hotels. After a great deal of research on the Internet, we selected the Clark Hotel. It was very clean, with good airconditioning (except during the daily power cuts). This was important as we were there at the height of summer. The staff was very helpful, but not all spoke good English. They tried their best, and we managed. This is not a five star hotel, obviously, but it was clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast buffet was good, with toast available for picky eaters (like my children). Indian food, as well as some &quot;international&quot; dishes like chinese food, etc, was also available for all meals, and was not hideously spicy. Even the Indian food was not too spicy. They are trying to cater to American/European palates, I think. However, I think that they are bringing in the food from another location as the &quot;restaurant&quot; appears to be a room with no kitchen attached. This can cause rather long wait times for food (think 30-45 minutes after ordering). This can be a problem after a long, hot day, especially with small children. There is a neaby McDonalds. The area is really, really busy with cars, people, beggars, etc., all the usual India issues and at night there is a market which might be fun to explore if you don't mind the mosquitos. We didn't do this as the kids were exhausted at night. The area might be a bit of a shock if you have never been to India before. Overall, it was a good place to stay for a few nights, especially if you don't want to spend spend hundreds of dollars a night for a 5 star property, but you want a clean hotel with western toilets (very important) and A/C. The pick up from the airport was included, but the drive back was not. One other note for female travelers, is try to get some Indian clothes, like a salwar kameez. Even during the hottest of days, it is very comfortable as they can be made of very light cotton. I saw several women wearing tank tops and shorts, and they are usually being followed by groups of strange men. Not pleasant. In India, if you wear shorts and sleeveless tops, you may as well be walking around in your underwear. "
hotel clark international ,"Great Hotel for the price Yes, we had agreat time at the Clark after staying at a couple of similar hotels which were 'nasty' Don't have any doubts about staying there the place is very clean and the food brilliant,staff could'nt be more helpful. You can arrange for a driver to take you around Delhi for a fixed price so no worries there. I recommend you pack ear plugs even at the top 5* hotels you can hear the road noise from your hotel room.We had no problems with the water, hot water all the time. Electric went out from time to time but that happened every where in Delhi.We stayed there for 2 weeks and if I can remember it went out twice to come back on in 5mins or less. The outside of the hotel was dirty and would not liked to have walked outside on my own but that is the case all over Delhi. "
hotel clark international ,"Do not be deceived!! Thanks to Photoshop, they've managed to delete all the electrical wires hovering over their shaded windows, their neighboring buildings and whatever else that looks nasty in their surrounding. So when you look it up online, you would think that the hotel is in a nice, quiet area. We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by, horns beeping, people's voices, et al. Not very comfortable when all you need is a good night's sleep. We had a portable heater in our room and it wasn't working, so we phoned the reception to replace it. They did...with another non-working unit. Great. The room and bathroom is OK and the bed was clean. But we didn't really get value for our money. We think the hotel is overpriced especially with the location. "
hotel clark international ,"OK Hotel Great Breakfast Pros: Good hotel in Delhi, offered free airport pickup. Great breakfast included in room price. Room had a modern feel. "
hotel clark international ,"Good mid range hotel in Delhi My friend and I stayed here in September, the only fault was they we're revamping the reception which was transformed in the space of 24hrs - no mucking about! And it really didn't affect us just added to the adventures of India.We were picked up as promised from the airport which I highly recommend, the room was excellent (we chose to stay in one of the suites).The travel guide in the hotel sorted us out for our private car trips around Delhi, Taj Mahal and then onto Japiur.Food here is excellent so we ate here on both evenings! "
hotel clark international ,"Would avoid I did not have a great stay here. Initially when I booked, they told me a taxi from the airport was part of the package. When I arrived, they charged me 500rp for this. Then when I left, they tried to charge me another 100rp because the car was airconditioned. Also when I arrived, my room smelt like a sewer, so much so that someone had to come in and spray air freshener. The next day I changed rooms, and this was OK, so try NOT to stay on the bottom floor. The restaurant is OK with nice views. The hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir. However the internet was free. The service was very mixed. Some people were helpful, others were downright rude, especially the man who asked me to pay extra for the taxi. I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers. "
hotel clark international ,"An amazing hotel in the middle of the chaos that is Dehli. Having booked through Hostelbookers.com and read all the reviews, my boyfriend and I were worried about the hotels condition. I called the hotel 2 days before departure to book the airport transfer, the man was waiting ready for me. We arrived at the hotel at 6am way before check in time, but they allowed us a room at 1/3 of the normal rate. The room was amazing, all European amenities, a huge double bed and a 32&quot; flat screen TV all you could ask for in a room. we booked deluxe. We were pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay there again. Please do not be put off by the surrounding area, as you are in India you need to keep an open mind. Also the food in the restaurant on the roof is amazing, we had a tandoori platter for rs350, enough for two people. If you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed. "
hotel clark international ,Best Night Manager and very fine rooms I am a teacher who went with a colleague and 6 students on a Trip to India.We spend our very first night in the Clark and this was the best introduction to India. Although the hotel seems to be in the middle of mayhem it is a quiet spot and very western in all its amenities. The rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience... we had everything down to the bathroom slippers. The Night Duty manager &quot;Chakraworty&quot;) could not have been nicer and fullfilled every wish of us spoiled Westerners. Of course we had wireless free internet which was another plus because I wanted to let the student's parents know that we arrived safely.Breakfast was also super and served on the roof top. One amazing experience. 
hotel clark international ,"Great Market area in Karol Bagh Great Hotel, the staff were fantastic and helpful always. I was here with my wife, 1st time to India and we started on a tour in Delhi first. After you get over the initial shock of the driving, poverty and the streets you will grow to love this little gem of a hotel. The hotel is literally a 30 second walk from Karol Bagh market which is great fun, especially as we were there for Divali so the streets were lit and fireworks everywhere. You will get beggars in this area but you will find that throughout India which is a shame as there are so many homeless children. Change is a serious problem so try and get as much as possible as you wil get harrased. Travel agent name Arif is fantastic and i swear he works 24 hour days as he is always there. He arranged tours, transports etc and we had no problems. The Hotel Dining area is brilliant, situated on the roof and very open but with covering, food is of a high standard and service excellent. Dont believe everyone who says that Delhi is expensive compared to say Agra or Jaipur, that is only on certain items. My final comment is once you get over the shock of the streets leading to the hotel you will enjoy your stay, when the driver said we are here i nearly fell out of the car, but after my trip to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur &amp; Mumbai i enjoyed the experience of Delhi the most. "
hotel clark international ,"Oasis of calm We were in Delhi for the VIV India Exhibition at the Pragati Maidan, cost was a consideration when I chose the Clark International but we felt we had excellent value for money. The location is rather challenging, the noise and general grubbyness can be off putting but once you are inside the hotel everything changes. We reserved a suite, (this was still a good price compared to the 4 and 5 star hotel prices) and it was great. A large canopied bed with beautiful clean linen and a bathroom with a marble floor.The rooftop restaurant is very good, the food is excellent and although the hotel does not have a bar you can get a beer with your meal. Breakfast is decidedly Indian with not very much concession to European taste but we always found something suitable.The staff are very helpful, especially the travel agent, after the show we had set aside time to visit Rajasthan and it was organised for us very efficiently by Abysss tours.Overall I can recommend this hotel as being good value for money. "
hotel clark international ,"Nice clean room Pleasantly surprised about this hotel that we booked for the last night of our stay in India. Very clean and functional room (401), helpful staff. They agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didn't need by an airport drop-off early morning. "
hotel clark international ,"A Cozy Hotel in Delhi I stayed there November 6-13. The hotel staff is very attent?ve, the decor is tasteful and the rooms are comfortable. Breakfast on the rooftop is very pleasant -- ask for Chai (that's delicious Indian spiced tea), not the teabag option! The hotel is located in Asia's biggest shopping area, Karol Bagh. The ultra-modern Delhi Metro station is 5 minutes from the hotel. From there, you can get to Delhi's commercial and business center, Connaught Place, in just a few minutes more. "
hotel clark international ,"Ok hotel but not great we expected better stayed in this hotel 3 nights Oct 07. transfer from airport good as we were 90 mins late the driver waited for us..our room was dissapointing ,room 407. no view blacked out widow ( a concrete wall behind) I guess it was quiet apart form hearing the lift go up and down all night.No hot water at all during our stay. Roof top restaurant average lacked a few green plants lots of bird poo on the edges of the terrace, but delhi is delhi. food nothing special. wouldnt serve us beer but others seemed to have it.( whether they took it to the table themselves)We booked with late rooms and when we came to pay extra tax (luxury tax ) was added on the bill this was a laugh as this hotel was clean but def not luxury. not at all like the website pictures we looked at before booking, staff ok but not as friendly as other hotels we stayed in. "
hotel clark international ,"Bed smelt of wee no hot water. We hit the Clark International Hotel after 3 weeks in Bangalore and a couple of days in Udaipur. It was the worst hotel in our trip.My wife and I are from Australia, I was in India for work and my wife joined me after 3 weeks for a bit of an explore. We booked through Otel.com, and paid online for an Executive room, one up from the normal room type. However, when we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room, which had been painted that morning (paint still wet to touch) and found that the booking had somehow come through to Clark from Otel.com as &quot;standard double&quot;. We were there 3 days and did see other nice rooms but were told that these were not available.No hot water, we had to call the lobby each time and request. Then a man would come up to our room and put his hand under the shower for 10 minutes while the boiler or something fired up, and my wife stood around in a towel. Ah, the romance of India. The bed smelt of urine, and we did eventually get it replaced on day 1 which was good. Lots of renovation going on, but they did give us some free meals at the hotel restaurant which was some compensation. To go shopping we booked a van and driver at an exhorbitant price from the hotel travel desk. The driver got sulky when we wouldn't get out at the &quot;commission&quot; place that he recommended, and dropped us in the middle of nowhere, which was quite scary. Avoid...try somewhere else... "
hotel clark international ,"Not bad for Delhi Hotel was ok, was being decorated so constant smell of turps. No window which I found a bit weird. Breakfast was good on top floor restaurant, staff generally helpful. "
hotel clark international ,"Bad Don't Stay Here !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Booked via Expedia 3 weeks prior to stay. Included in room price ($100 AUD) was airport pick-up. On arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up (they were not bothered). We pulled up to hotel and parked - an auto (tuk tuk) accidently scratched the drivers old rusty car, the driver got out and smashed the auto guy across the head...meanwhile we were stuck in the car. Nice welcome!Check in, typical India...cold, fill out forms etc. Taken to room way way down back of hotel near generator. Room tiny, and in disrepair but neat (on surface). We thought O.K...it is Delhi (overpriced and poor quality).Within the hour...&quot;bang, bang&quot;, the sounds of drilling/sawing and metal banging. After 2 hours we called reception and asked when will the sound stop...&quot;oh 5 minutes&quot;. So after about 40 mins we thought lets go and see reception desk. Upon leaving our room the door was open adjacent. We walked into room where 2 guys were painting, the room was luxurious compared to ours and large. So we thought as we booked a superior delux we can change room. We walk up a level to see what the banging was and found all floors under maintanence, people everywhere painting, just crap everywhere.So we went down stairs and asked to see another room. &quot;No rooms&quot; we were told. We asked to see the manager...&quot;You wait&quot;. So we sat in foyer....after 30 mins of waiting we went up to the room, expecting the manager to call us when he was able. No call. About 45 mins later we decided to pack backpack and go into central Delhi for better hotel even though the Expedia / hotel took our money upon booking and credit card had already beeen charged.At reception the manager appeared. He was not bothered by our request nor concerned that we left. We did mention we would be complaining. We think they preferred not having guests at this time, cause we did not see 1 single guest during our 4 hours here.We complained to Expedia the next day, and they contacted the hotel and a refund was in the process (1 week). We would recommend not to stay here. No restaurant, no alcohol in mini-bar.We travelled for 6 weeks in India/Pakistan and by far this hotel was the worst we encountered. "
hotel clark international ,"Decent Value We opted for the most expensive room on the property, which was around US$125 per night. We were favorably impressed, the room was clean and very comfortable and the bed very nice. The hotel is located in a noisy and busy area, and to be honest when we arrived at the hotel we were not terribly impressed with the exterior of the building. However, the staff were very friendly and the other hotel guests we chatted with in the lobby loved the place, so we gave it a shot. The food is rather good and the rooftop restaurant is charming. Overall good value for the money but probably won't stay there again simply because the neighborhood is incredibly busy and very congested. If that doesn't bother you, try it out. Otherwise a good hotel. "
hotel clark international ,"a no go. I booked on expedia.com, choosing by price ($110), thinking there are a slew of hotels in the $30 range and a slew in the $300 range, and this would fit right in the middle. It did not. It is not near a 4 Star hotel, but what in India would be called a 3 star. Rooms are noisy, &quot;India Clean&quot; (sort of scruffy) and not worth more than $40. It seems the hotel is advertising on places like Expedia looking for people shopping by price -and trusting that you get what you pay for. While this is true generally, in India it is generally less true. Also, they overbooked us and moved us on the 2nd day of our stay: to a &quot;3 Star&quot; that was less than half the price (although they attempted to keep the rate the same) but was actually nicer. "
hotel clark international ,"Comfort in Unknown Territory Being a woman, alone and an inexperienced traveler, you bet I was nervous when I arrived in Delhi at 3:00 a.m. My flight was 4 hours late and I had no idea what to expect. A huge wave of relief washed over me when I found my name being held up by a friendly face at the front of the overwhelming crowd. The hotel was definitely dedicated to taking care of their guests.I was further comforted to be met with a strong display of professionalism at the reception, especially at 3:30 a.m. The other hotel staff were patient with my conflicting sleep schedule and did their best to help me obtain whatever I needed during those first hours.The hotel’s choice of tour agency to help me plan the rest of my journey to Rajasthan, Kashmir and Daramshala was outstanding. The employees of Abyss Tours were friendly and personable. I completely forgot the fact that I was alone in a strange land very far away from home. All recommendations of hotels throughout the tour were superb.I will always recommend all my family and friends who wish to travel to India in the future to stay at Clark’s and use Abyss Tours to ensure that they will find the whole Indian experience as delightful as I did. "
hotel clark international ,"Enjoyed our stay at Clark International! We stayed at this hotel for two days and here's why I liked it.1. The staff is very courteous and helpful.2. The rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets, they are provided promptly.3. The food is very good and their breakfast buffet is impressive.4. the hotel is centrally located and one can easily access major tourist attractions. "
hotel clark international ,"Good Midrange Hotel After having considerable difficulty locating a midrange ($50-$100) hotel in Delhi for a personal visit, we settled on the Clark Intl. based on reviews on TripAdvisor. We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. 1) They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. They come in an Indica (small car) so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance.2) Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean. Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what $50-60 per night can get you in Delhi. The area around the hotel is not great (in the middle of Karol Bagh) - that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp. the courteous staff.3) The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional.4) We had made our own taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing and there was no pressure put on us by hotel staff to use their services. They did organize airport dropoff for us when requested.Overall very happy with the hotel - would definitely stay there again if going thru' Delhi on personal visit. "
hotel clark international ,"Not a bad deal for the location and facilities The hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station . The facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well .The complementary breakfast is good . The negatives - the surrounding areas are not too good , but you cannot have a central location like Karol bagh and peace together. They provided complimentary pick up from airport (because it was free the driver did not run AC and we did not particularly insist although it was hot) . The reception staff was also helpful in arranging early morning taxi drop off to Nizammudin Rly station.Overall a good value for money proposition and above average clean facilities in a central location. "
hotel clark international ,"Better than expected For our arrival in Delhi my partner and I were looking for a clean but basic hotel at which to spend our first night. After reading reviews for other hotel in the sprawling city we decided upon the Clark International.As promised the hotel duly provided the complimentary pick up from IGA as promised. Although we were informed by email before we arrived that as we were to arrive at 0800 we would not be able to check-in until 1200, this was not the case. The hotel was able to accommodate us immediately, which after a long journey was greatly appreciated.The room was basic but spotlessly clean with a working air cooler (rather that air conditioning) which was noisy but apply drowned out the street noise below.As anticipated we were offered trips, booked through the hotels' travel agency, but when we declined their offer there was no 'hard sell', unlike a lot of India.The hotel is not centrally located but is a short five minute walk from the efficient New Delhi Metro. "
hotel clark international ,"Great buy off season I picked the Clark based on reviews on Trip Advisor. Got a good deal through hotels.com and then hoped that I had made the right choice. It was. My pal and I had a terrific room in a not-so-full hotel, for an off-season price that made my friends' jaws drop (people always tell me Delhi doesn't have mid-range hotels -- apparently, we found the only one). Our two-bed room was very clean, we had air conditioning, a fridge, ceiling fan, cable TV, nice bathroom, and a very nice staff happy to help. It was as quiet as can be expected (for *Delhi*). The staff recommended a travel company nearby to rent a car &amp; driver for a day, and the driver took us to a fantastic shop for clothes, then to a beauty parlor near the hotel to get a very reasonably-priced manicure and pedicure. The second day, when we told the staff where we wanted to go, they recommended we take the metro, which isn't too far away by walking, and is a terrific way to get around. There is some shopping not too far away from the hotel -- shoe stores are good, but the clothing stores weren't so great. There aren't really restaurants around, so you will have to rent a car/driver for that (room service is decent at the hotel). I found the hotel a great respite at the end of each day. Will definitely stay again. "
hotel clark international ,"Comparatively Impressive In general, Delhi is a shaddy place, full of touts and scammers. The Clark is relatively safe, clean, and a good deal for a budget hotel. Our room did not have any windows, but the sheets were incredibly soft and clean; the beds were comfortable, and the airconditioning a blessing. The hotel is also near a local night market and only five minutes from the Karol Bagh metro. Do not trust the hotel tour guide! He brought us to his office and pretended to call the train station for tickets. He lied about the seat availabilty, luring us to his expensive car rides. Rather, check with ABC (?) travels, which is on the corner of the hotel block. In all, the hotel was a decent stay, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. "
hotel clark international ,"Beware of being bumped! We booked three rooms in advance for the Clark International - but despite having our bookings confirmed (and our credit cards charged!), on arrival we discovered that the hotel had over-booked itself and were abruptly ushered round the corner to a much lower standard hotel.Although our booking was with the Clark, we can only review it on the basis of the accomodaiton they supplied us with: the rooms were dull and not clean (a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture); the bathroom consisted of a shower, an overflowing toilet and a bucket; the ceiling was covered with small flies; the hotel was noisy (children running around and constant unidentified dripping in each room during the whole night); and the breakfast cutlery was not clean.When we confronted the manager of the Clark International about being moved to inferior accomodation, he claimed that it was due to a business conference, and as a result the cost of our evening meal was waived - but we still left feeling shortchanged and somewhat disappointed with the experience.The communal areas (including the restaurant) in the Clark seemed of an acceptable standard - the roof terrace is worth a look for the sight of a heaving city.However, even if we had a cast-iron guarantee of a room at the Clark, we would probably not book there again as the hotel does look rather tired. "
hotel clark international ,excellent hotel. you get very good service delicious food for a very reasonnab Francoise Wang-Toutain. french nationality the location of the hotel is very convenient. Delhi metro station is a 5 minutes (may be 3) walk and the metro goes directly to Connaught place. The staff is very welcoming and help for finding places where you want to go. the restaurant on the fifth floor gives a view of this part of Delhi witha large and very clean terrasse The food is very clean and delicious (I mean for a foreigner like me) the room are comfortable (though I had not the most comfortable one). The cleaning is done correctly everyday. the internet is free access. Also on the road to the metro station you have a nice market selling indian clothes and also daily life things. It is opened until 9 o'clock in the evening. It's a niceplace to spend some time. I stayed for ten days in this hotel for I was working In New Delhi. It was nice to come back every evening in a clean and friendly place. I would recommend the hotel for those who do not like the snobbish atmosphere of the great palaces of Delhi but still want good qualities rooms and services. 
hotel clark international ,"Acceptable two star hotel I stayed at that place twice, with quick and friendly check in. Rooms on both occations were small but rather clean with surprisingly good bed linen. Bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets. Good towels provided and they even had toiletries. Neighborhood is an extremly busy and loud bazaar area with traffic that drives you crazy. Since no taxi driver knows this hotel, suggest you print our the location map from the hotels web side. Personally, I prefered to eat at McDonalds just around the corner, or a Pizza Hut 300 meters away, not really finding the hotel restaurant appealing enough. For cheap internet access and even printers, there is a place right next to the hotel. "
hotel clark international ,"You get what you pay for (in pounds dollars As several other visitors have noted, there are very few mid-range priced hotels in India. I am an American and have lived in Bangalore almost two years and find it's low end or Taj properties, all over $150/night with not much choice in between. The Hotel Clark International itself was nice, but was on a narrow side street in an older part of town. I appreciated the pick up service from the airport, even though the plane was over an hour late. The driver tried to hustle me to a travel agency almost immediately, but we needed time to rest because my traveling companion was not feeling well from the flight. After an hour, he took me one minute's walk to Indian Tribal Tours (see my review in Delhi info). The dining room is on the top-5th- floor, but the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor, so it's not handicap-friendly. Check in and out was efficient. The buffet breakfast was fine; omelettes could be cooked to order. There is both inside and outside seating. I asked for a quiet room and we were given a small room with no windows. Actually, the A/C unit was in the window. The hotel was a bit pricey for India and what we got, but I'm not going to complain about it. "
hotel clark international ,"New Delhi Great hotel - very basic but great service. The hotel was a bit noisy between 7am- 7pm because of the market, but you felt like you were in India and not a sterile 5* hotel.My two children loved it and we had a great short stay in Delhi. "
hotel clark international ,"Good service. Nice Place. Great Value. Clark International is a fine hotel. Our rooms were clean. The room service was quick and food very good. All of the staff were very pleasant.We took advantage of the pickup from airport as well as a trip to Agra and a tour of Delhi. The tours were good and the pickup is handy. The hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements from the moment we landed to our departure. This is an extra cost, on top of the room, but well worth it. It made things very easy and enjoyable for us. We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Delhi for a few days. There is a bit of street noise at night, as the other reviewers have said, but it is tolerable. "
hotel clark international ,"Safe Clean and Trying hard Clark International DelhiTrying to maintain a decent standard of budget hotel in a chaotic city. This is clean, safe (at least for us), with services, fittings and staff that work, if all look rather tired, and decent if not exciting food. Use a locker for your valuables. There is no free mineral water, but its only about 15r from the minibar, and there are supermarkets through narrow doors and sometimes in the basements in the major shopping street, one short block from the hotel (where sundries will cost next to nothing).If you arrive on the early UK flight your room isn't likely to be ready until the guests check out and it's serviced, so you'll need to hang around in the restaurant, with an accumulating number of guests until it is. Pay for breakfast ~300r whilst you wait, other breakfasts and transfers are normally included, all explained on their website which seems accurate in text, though the pictures are overly flattering, and taken with an estate agents eye! We could not discern any advantage of our 'presidential-suite', apart from being marginally higher up from the traffic, so I'd suggest booking based on ensuite/no-ensuite and being done with it.Be prepared for standard scary Indian driving practises on the pickup, but the management will come to both the airport and the train station with a board whilst the driver waits (including meeting you from your carriage in the later case) which is very helpful if you take the all air-con out-early-late-back express (thoroughly recommended) to Agra for the day. There will probably be a couple of mini power outages or fluctuations during a day as well, which will trip the TV and air-conditioning, but normally last &lt;30s.The hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops, be prepared for noise, dust, disorganised telephone lines, stray dogs and dilapidated store fronts. It can be a bit of a shock if this is your first stop in India, the rest of the city is much the same, but there is a huge jump up in cost to the better hotels which have gardens and gates to sheild you from this.There are two metro station within a short walk, Karol Bagh is the one to head for, the other requires negotiating a difficult junction. The hotel has a useful if slightly haphazardly scaled and street named map. Its well worth collecting this along with a business card in order to get back to the hotel via an Auto through the myriad streets. We couldn't find a prepaid auto stop nearby the hotel, but there are plenty in the city centre to help you get back.The restaurant is on a roof terrace which gives a good view of the urban roof top landscape, for better and for worse - geckos on the whitewash, palm squirrels scampering on parapets, kites circling in the smog, continual honking of horns, inexplicable sirens, horns or drums (depending on the date) and endless dust. It's done out in Bamboo, with nightlights and waiter service and tries it's best. The Indian style food is better than the western, the breakfast is an odd mix of the two. "
hotel clark international ,"Clark International -Good Hotel in Budget Price Peter Goh: Hi There, this is my first exprience in Hotel Clark International, New Delhi, India. And it was extremely good. They provided good service beyond my thoughts. The hotel clark is three star amenities but they have some five star facilities. I got pick-up on time as they promised. Food was really good,bit spicy but i like. Staff was very friendly. And one of the best interesting thing is free wi-fi. Room was neat &amp; clean &amp; specially beds &amp; linen. Finally we enjoyed lot. My suggestion for travellers: Avoid any type of reviews &amp; use your exprience &amp; mind.Peter Goh "
hotel clark international ,"Clean safe and well staffed. Pity about the noise... Although I'd concur with other reviewers comments regarding this being a clean, well maintained and well-staffed hotel, I can't really go any further without mentioning the street noise, which a light sleeper would really struggle with. Hard to blame the hotel for this but worth pointing out.The pick-up service was good and appreciated given our delayed arrival at Delhi Airport but I found the hard-sell tactics from our pick-up regarding procuring guides and further travel tickets a little tiresome when you've just arrived off a long flight. The hotel staff were however, efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transport/tourist issues.Also worth pointing out for the uninitiated, that Karol Bagh (the area in which the hotel is located) is a long way from the tourist sights of Old and New Delhi, although the hotel is just a five minute walk from Delhi's crowded but otherwise excellent new Metro system (Karol Bagh stop). So the airport pick-up makes even more sense in that you can get a grip on the geography of the place before you venture out.All in all, just about worth the money but be careful if you are a light sleeper! "
hotel clark international ,"The Objective Truth First of all in order to provide readers with unbiased review, it will be best to start with the general context. First-timers in India, especially travellers from Europe and the US should know that India is very different place from home, not saying good, bad, beautiful, or ugly, the word different incorporates all those adjectives. My word for India would be spicy. When I arrived at the airport, I felt a little disturbed, it cannot be compared to the Munich airport that I left. The facilities looked much older, it was dirty and the place was crowded with colorful people. OK, I needed a coffee urgently, first surpise was that there was no schwarz coffee available, don't you even think of a good espresso, so I had to go for a nescafe. On the way out of the customs, a driver holding a sign with my name was waiting (I requested from the hotel my complimentary pick-up). The trip to the hotel was an adventure itself, people cooking in cauldrons on the street, small cars and motorbikes everywhere. The traffic is very busy, all cars scratched and those people horn vigorously, in fact, due to the fact I guess that they drive on the right side, on the buses you see the signs &quot;Keep distance&quot; and &quot;Please horn&quot;. This habit of pressing the horn vigorously, I did not like, because in the Clark hotel, I could easily hear those, because of the ill-fitted windows. Well, the first night it bothered me a lot, from the second night on, I got used to it. A few words for the hotel - it is situated near Khan Road (Ghaffar market) and honestly it is very busy area, dirt, small shops, street vendors, ugly buildings. The hotel itself is OK, reasonably clean and the staff was friendly, but I would expect more for 60-70 EUR a night. There was hot water during the first day, then disappeared, then came back. Breakfast was...OK.... I had an omlett, some toasts and butter....the rest I did not eat. I had troubles finding good quality food. My Indian hosts, however, brought me to a distant beutiful residential area, to a restaurant called Chopsticks - excellent place (I remember it was located in Asiad Village)The hotel has a computer room with ppl who reply to e-mails, 3-4 of those young ppl I saw. Here I must mentioned that before picking up Clark international, I had hard times finding a hotel in India, and my travel agent could not help me much. Later speaking with my Indian hosts, one of my suspicion was confirmed - mid-range hotel in India is not what the European traveller expects. OK, Clark Internation is really a mid-range hotel for India, some of the other hotels in the area, those with fallen letters from their signs, really scared me. So, in New Delhi there are some very shitty hotels, some that are OK, like Clark International, and good hotels, which I later saw. The good hotels are located around Counnaught place.......beatiful gardens and luxury, but available for a bit above $ 300 a night. Some names of those are: 1. Hotel Imperial2. Hotel Le Meridian3.The Park4. Shangri La5. Ashoka Palace5. Taj MansinghIt is your choice, some people like to walk in the dirt, in those charming markets and bargain, however I got sick from the food and water (no ice, only bottled water), I had a three-day diarreah when I came back home, but this is because I was not cautious enough. I saw beautiful palces (Humayun Tomb, Qutub Mnar, Sagrafang Tomb, Museum of Handicrafts, India Gate.....), lovely gardens and everything is cheap. "
hotel clark international ,"Top class Infrastructure - excellent.Room &amp; Toilet - Spic n span, clean at the corners, pleasant colors, clean n comfortable bed, clean linen and towels, well stocked mini fridge.Staff - Extremely friendly, cooperative and supportive.Restaurant - very good.Travel support - very good with in-house cars and drivers.

"
hotel clark international ,Excellent Service - good value We stayed at Clark for 4 days. Bookings were arranged directly with the hotel - we were picked up (even though our plane was delayed and we were over an hour late) and presented with roses (a bit OTT but still a nice surprise!). Staff very helpful and check in/out was very smooth.Rooms were fine - probably worth going for one up from the standard so you are higher up and away from the street noise. There is also a local market one road down that starts 5-ish until late (except Mondays) - very useful for picking up nick naks and getting quick deep fried snacks from. The hotel is about 20 minutes tuk-tuk ride to Connaught Place and about 35 minutes in a taxi from the airport.They organised a car and driver to take us on an Agra tour - much cheaper than the tour operators in the area.I have a suspicion that the food is brought in from a kitchen out side the hotel - but room service was always prompt and good value for money. The rooftop restaurant lacks ambience but worth a visit so you can watch the eagles swoop for their dinner - you can also get very close up to them as they land on the roof.The hotel doesn't have any alcohol listed on it's menus - but can still be ordered off the bill!

hotel classic ,Worst hotel why i come here ? I was confirming at hotel classic. The room service was good if you put some money for the house keeping. The price they charge for the rooms are again too high for what you want to get. Management should be ashamed of them. 
hotel classic ,Nice Clean Hotel Near Metro We travelled Delhi in group tour of India of Delhi Agra Jaipur Jaiselmer. Hotel Classic is nice clean hotel with good facilities. We were served well by smiling staff. Hotel is near metro station will lift which in useful for old person like us. 
hotel classic ,Loved The Classic Hospitality Hotel Classic is Classic in all means. I was planning to cancel my trip to India due to disturbances in India but Owner Jitendra Chadda helped me on email and assured that he will take care of us. I am happy that I believed on him. He made our trip easy by making all our trips confirmed. Pickup person was always smiling (I was very annoyed with Cusom person at Airport) but he took care of our luggage. Rooms were cleaned with all basic amenities. We were upgraded to executive room on third floor at no extra cost which was surprise for us. Breakfast was good in room. Wifi was complementry at lobby and I found it very useful. We would be returning here next month on our way back. 
hotel classic ,Excellent Stay I have been visiting India's cities for last 2Months. This hotel has been most comfortable and memorable experience. After being picked from Airport in Air Conditioned Car we were given upgraded room on arrival. Service was good. Hot showers worked early morning (Surprising in Indian Cities). Even breakfast was served at 5AM on my request. Location is good with all food joints nearby. Lots of shopping also. Overall my experience was excellent. Thanks to management. 
hotel classic ,Bad Experience I booked the hotel on internet after seeing good reviews but on my arrival uncleaned room given to me but when i request the front desk they tell me to wait for 2 hours but after that they shift my room and again there was same problem. But at last they solve the problem. Over all experience was bad the room service was not good. The front manager was polite and good but service was zero.My over all experience was bad even manager approach me to put good review for the hotel and agree to give me the discount.... 
hotel classic ,"Could be cleaner great location for metro We arrived in the middle of the night having been picked up by taxi (read two chaps in someone's small car which unnerved us a little) arranged by the hotel prior to our arrival which wasa lot less hassle than trying to deal with mayhem at the airport at midnight. We stayed for two nights and found the staff to be really helpful and the service great, with room service at pretty much any time of night or day. The constant Bollywood blaring out of the reception TV was a little offputting at 3 o'clock in the morning but nothing compared to the rest of the noise in Delhi. Our room was quite large and had table and chairs and a sofa as well. The bed was large and quite comfortable, but the sheets weren't the cleanest I've ever seen and it didn't help that we didn't realise we were supposed to remove the wierd pillow cases before getting into bed. The bathroom was a bit grim, but no grimmer than any of the other hotels we stayed at in India during the fortnight that we stayed. The major bonus about this hotel is that it is in the middle of a slightly quieter surburban district and it is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station, which for Westerners is the easiest, cheapest, least hassle method of getting round. The area was packed with shops,restaurants and one of the only department stores I saw. The metro being so close was perfect. although being separated (boys in one line, girls in another) for X-Ray scanning prior to embarking everytime was certainly an interesting method of security that I doubt passengers would tolerate on the Tube. There are probably other better value perhaps slightly cleaner hotels out there, but for first time visitors to India we found this easy, hassle-free, OK value for money, with good service, good English communication, and ideally situated for an initial foray into Delhi. "
hotel classic ,Loved the Hotel N Staff Good Clean Budget Hotel in Market Area Koral Bugh. We had beed reffered by friends who visited last year. It was very nice experience. Staff very friendly. 
hotel classic ,"great for two women travelling alone pick up at airport was spot on, the man with placard with my name on it waiting for us, with the hustle and bustle of Delhi airport this was abonus for RS900 to arrive safe at the hotel, I also booked day tours to Agra and Jaipur,RS850 each.A/C bus for both, mostly Indians are the tourists that board these buses, so you have some good times joking about how much extra westerners have to pay to visit monuments. The hotel was clean comfortable beds and occationally hot water, but to be fair we were geting up at 5am to go on the trips. Breakfast we had in our room as there is no dining room, but this was nota problem, as a couple of times we had a meal in the evening, there is a good S,Indian restraunt round the corner and a modern food court. The area of the hotel did not make us feel afraid to walk out in the evening, sometimes we did not get back from trips till midnight. The staff are a real jolly gang and could not do enough to help us, they booked a local taxi to take us round Delhi for the day and this is probably the best way to see most things in Delhi.I had been e mailing the owner for a couple of months prior to my visit, so when I met him it was like meeting an old friend. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, it is a quiet retreat in the busy noisy city that is Delhi. "
hotel classic ,"Stay in Delhi Hotel was refered to us through common friend. But before placing booking on Expedia we crosschecked the reviews and foud it very satifactory. We were picked up from Airport on request to hotel and were given room on 3rd floor as requested in mail.Hotel is central located , clean, near to metro tube station. Nearby Mcdonald was a blessing for us.Hotel Manager arranged tour for us to Agra and Jaipur.We loved to stay here and recommend it to our friends surely. "
hotel classic ,Bed bugs We stayed here for just one night prior to returning home......the whole appearance is shabby however we were not prepared for the rude awakening by the bed bugs...very large bed bugs. On complaining at the front desk we were told they'd move us the next day which was useless since we were leaving. They brought up a bug spray and 'clean' bedding which in fact looked even dirtier.No breakfast is included and to be honest I'd really have my doubts on the standard of hygiene in food preperation...therefore we did not call for any room service.Its not a cheap hotel and better can be found for the price in this area. 
hotel classic ,"nice clean hotel at great location The location is very convenient for the metro - a 5 minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is, and then it's only 3 stops to Rajiv Chowk Connaught Place. There's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi .The staff is fabulous, always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone. The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at 9 pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card.The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about 30 minutes. we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in .

hotel classic ,"grungy hotel Really quite expensive for a grungy little hotel. The location is fairly central and close to the metro that's about it. The rooms look pretty tired, tv had poor reception and no complimentary breakfast. On arrival after a long trip went to get into bed but found the sheets and duvet cover were really dirty and stained. We phoned to ask for clean sheets but the sheets the staff brought up were worse than the ones already on the bed. They went through several sets of sheets looking for clean ones but found them all in a similar state with blood stains, greese spots and/or holes. They gave up after looking through several sets &amp; up and opened a brand new set for us. For IRs 2811 (approximately US $60.00) we expect clean sheets. "

As part of our stay we arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the airport, saving a huge amount of time &amp; hassle. The next morning we found that we were in the very safe &amp; friendly Karol Bagh. The hotel itself was clean &amp; functional, nothing flash. However, what made the stay so memorable was the helpfulness of the staff and the hotel's location. Go up the street &amp; turn right and there's a very good, cheap, vegetarian restaurant. Turn left &amp; there's a 24 hour ATM that accepts foreign cards (very handy as it takes forever to change money in the bank). Go down the street &amp; you're in the thick of the Karol Bagh market where you can buy anything &amp; everything very cheaply. Turn left and the metro station is at the end of the street. From here you can see a lot of the city easily and inexpensively (11 rupees to the Red Fort). "
hotel classic ,"Not worth it There is nothing really wrong with this hotel but you can do better for the price.The room was clean, with TV, hot water, etc.The staff were fine - although sent me to get ripped off when buying a SIM card from their friend.Airport pick up was good but you can do it for MUCH cheaper. They charge 900 INR, when you can get there easily for 300 INR. "
hotel classic ,"Does not offer WiFi in the way they advertise it! One of the reasons I liked the sound of this hotel was because of the other reviews saying the WiFi access is good.However, when I arrived they said I could only access the internet from the lobby. The lobby is very small and the only seating area is next to the reception desk, practically blocking the main thoroughfare of the hotel.This is an inconvenience, not a value add. Not at all comfortable and certainly not appropriate for any more than 5-10 min use. "

hotel classic ,Perfect Hotel for Our Short Visit This is Nice Hotel in Market Place Koral Baugh. We were very worried for our agents choice of hotel before arriving India. But our worries vanished when we arrived at Hotel Classic. Agent made a perfect choice as we required clean but not costly rooms. Hotel was extremely clean. Staff was very cheerful and replied to my queries about Agra. We are a group of 7 persons came for Taj Visit. We were provided with our choice of breakfast in our bed as we did not wanted to have breakfast anywhere else. Dinner was also very good. We will visit again on our return trip. 
hotel classic ,GREAT START OF TRIP!!!!!!!!!!! Great Great Great. Our Start of Tour has been Excellent. We booked this hotel by watching reviews of this hotel. I did not expected that organising Indian tour could be so much easy. I requested Airport pickup at midnight and hotel offered pickup for US$20 instead of US$25 as listed in website. They were prompted in replying and confirming. Maduu Hotel Pickup person was waiting for us in A/C Car. Room was same as shown in website. No Carpets with Wifi at Lobby-FREE. Now at Indore I called hotel and thanked. We will definately visit hotel again on my way back to US. 
hotel classic ,"good hotel I spent 3 nights in this hotel.Rooms were quite good, clean and not noisy.I would avoid room 104 and 107 on 1st floor, since they are next to some a/c machines and imagine are quite noisy.Staff was nice, spoke good english and helped me whenever i asked for.Hotel is 5 min walking from metro station.The hotel almost meets western standards and i would recommend it to a friend. "
hotel classic ,Love It Our Uncle Booked 2 Rooms for us in this hotel. Before comming here we were very afraid to travel to India due to Bombs and terrorist attacks. But for a marrige sake in Mogga(Punjab) we had to come. But we are happy that we were in safe hand of this good hotel in croweded Delhi. Pickup was excellent in Big Cab with one of hotel person standing with placard at morning odd hours. Rooms were very comfortable. Free Wifi is available at Reception area due to security reasons. Staff very helpful. We are moving today to Punjab and will be back in this hotel again next week for overnight stay. 
hotel classic ,"An acceptable Delhi hotel The Hotel Classic is an average mid-range hotel in the bustling Karol Bagh district. The good: - The hotel is very cheap. We paid 1500 rupees per night for a private AC room.- The room service menu (including breakfast) is very cheap for basic but tasty food. We had Indian food one night from there for dinner at it was delicious and extremely cheap.- The hotel can arrange reasonably priced transfers and pick-ups to the airport and train station (but with issues, see below)- It is only a 5 minute walk to Delhi’s excellent Metro system which can take you to Connaught Place and Old Delhi without having to sit in traffic.- The room and bathroom are clean.- The Air Con is very effective.- Laundry is reasonably priced.The not so good:- The view from the room is of another building, and is not nice at all.- The TV has only Indian channels. - The location is so-so. If you’re a white person, you stand out a bit in the very busy area of Karol Bagh.- There is no in-room safe.- The bathroom is basic (clean, though) and has no shower curtain.- We had to check out of the hotel at 3am and get to the airport quickly. I had pre-arranged a transfer with the hotel to pick us up at 3:15am, but when we came to the lobby with our bags etc there was no record of any booking being made. They were able to get us a car in ten minutes though (resplendent with totally shattered windscreen).- Hot water is sporadic so expect a few cold showers.I would not advise people against this hotel, but I don’t think I could recommend it either. I suspect there are better located, nicer hotels in Delhi. It all comes down to how much you want to spend. "
hotel classic ,"A most excellent starting point in India!!!!! This hotel turned out to be the PERFECT starting point for our visit to India. Mr. Jitender made arrangements for our driver and car and also set me up with a local travel agency to make other hotel arrangements in India.There is no room for error when traveling in India...so the driver Mr. Jitender arranged for us was most important. His name was Suresh, and he was incredible. The hotel was very inexpensive by my travel standards as I am used to paying $100 to $200 per night. Classic was our first impression of India...and the staff there was friendly, warm and welcoming. As we arrived late, they even took my morning breakfast order and then delivered it to me right on time! Thank you Mr. Jitender for making our India trip a success. "
hotel classic ,"very helpful staff great location, near the metro station. the room is clean and the hotel staff are very helpful,especially the manager. train,flight reservation can be made thru this hotel and the most important thing, u can chat and get informations online from the staff "
hotel classic ,"Clean generally acceptable room This is an inexpensive hotel in a very crowded neighborhood that will probably be very foreign and confusing to most westerners. I stayed here for two nights upon arriving in India, and while the hotel itself is fine, above average value by Indian standards, I would advise staying at a Western hotel for a couple of days upon arrival to acclimate to India.The good: rooms are clean; I though my room smelled bad, but then I realized the problem was that my window did not shut completely, and so was letting in the smell of Delhi. Furniture is acceptable, the bed is quite comfortable, and while nothing about the room is spectacular, it is acceptable, at the level of budget accommodation in the US, and I was fine paying the posted price for the room. The airport pickup was smooth. The staff dealt with me honestly, quoting me prices for cars and services that turned out to be quite reasonable and fair. I appreciate this. One desk worker made a call in Hindi for me, which was very nice. They gave me a wakeup call (2 other places I stayed at in India forgot). There was a computer with a slow Internet connection right next to my room that I used several times, without being charged. They routed several phone calls to my room for me. The bill was handled in a straightforward, efficient manner.The bad: hot water was in and out (this was true in all of India for me), I couldn't get the cable TV to work, the driver they found for me was a dishonest shyster, as near as I could tell I was the only guest, yet there was a staff of about 10 Indians milling around the lobby at all times, which was intimidating and weird. The location, in my view, is less than ideal for a tourist, it is hard to find; at any rate, I would recommend getting a driver for the whole day and not attempting to go on foot from here. The view out my window was of a filthy courtyard, and the windows did not shut completely.This is acceptable accommodation, and while there are nicer hotels to be had for more money, if this is what fits your budget, I think you can feel good about staying there. "
hotel classic ,"Always the Best We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in India and for 2 nights at the end(now too hot to stay here), the first part in a room and the second in a suite.The suite was large, clean and quiet.The staff were courteous, obliging and quietly efficient.This was the one decent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference.I asked to have breakfast served in my room. Once again, no problem at all, no extra charge for the brilliant and quick room service. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Delhi. "
hotel classic ,"Loved the Classic with Classic Service Hotel has the best service you could want. They made us feel right at home, and went out of their way to supply all our needs and more. All of the staff made us feel comfortable and were very respectful. Arriving in Delhi at 10pm we got off the plane to find Madhusudan waiting for us with a welcoming smile. We found the service and the staff a delight; they did everything to make us feel at home. They indeed provided me assistance in providing air tickets to Mumbai for tomorrow without any service charge. I recommend this hotel to everyone in my friends and relatives. "
hotel classic ,"Peacefull Hotel in Hectic Delhi This was the one decent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference. Very cool place, peaceful and stylish. Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid. Its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for. I have now few hours to linger at Delhi Airport, so thought of posting review instead of crushing down in rush at counters.Management owner was great help in arranging tours for us.Market is just walking distance and location is Lively only drawback is traffic noice during day but as night crawls in all get smoothened up.There's a computer and desk provided in the passage area and the internet connection is good. The laundry service was also good and we had no problems with anything we got back, and thought that we probably could have trusted it with more than we did.We also hired the hotel's driver &amp; car for a few hours for some sight-seeing around Delhi and were pleased with the service. "
hotel classic ,"Impressed with Service I am still staying in this hotel. Extreeeeemly clean :-). Loved thy are treating us. I must say I have travelled a lot in South East Asia this Season but the service, facilities and management is uncomarable to any 3* hotel anywhere. They kept person waiting at Airport even our flight was late almost 3hours and they didn't charge extra penny for such delay. We are here blessed with Free Wi Fi with compliments of management. Owner /Boss ?? is wonderful guy assisting our local trips with detailed maps- that too complimentry!!!!. Staff here is attentive to our calls and swing into action whenever required. Location is wonderfull- in busy busy market. Pollution -Key factor Govt should look into. Just two blocks away is metro station connecting to main city centre-CP. "
hotel classic ,"Great little hotel I booked this hotel for 2 nights after having seen some positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Rechecking Trip Advisor shortly before I left for Delhi I was concerned to see that subsequently a couple of very poor reviews had been posted, one of which suggested that guests had been somehow induced to write good reviews. It was therefore with some trepidation that I decided to stick with my original reservation, and in fact it was too late to cancel anyway. I am happy to report that, for me, this was an excellent choice of hotel. I thought it was full of real charm. The pre-booked transfer from the airport could not have been smoother, especially given that my flight was over 2 hours late arriving. Most of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I really liked the room I was given. In fact I simply cannot understand why the poor reviews were posted. Were they really staying at the same hotel? Can the other rooms really be so different in terms of cleanliness?, this would seem highly unlikely to me. Maybe the hotel has simply got its act together following the unfavourable reviews. My room was extremely clean, cosy, quiet and had everything one might need (television, fridge, telephone, writing desk, comfy chairs, extremely comfy bed). The furniture may not have been very new, but it was fine. The bathroom was also extremely clean, nothing flashy but perfectly adequate. There was also a nice roof terrace for sitting out - with the addition of some chairs and plants this could be an extremely pleasant place to lounge around for a while. Breakfast served in room also worked well. I would definitely stay here again. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, or indeed any other hotel in Karol Bagh, check out the nearby Ajmal Khan Park to see the local population enjoying all this small park has to offer. "
hotel classic ,"comfortable n best stay ideally located,excellent service ,warm staff and i always make my customers stay there and all appreciate the hotel. "
hotel classic ,"It is OK I chose this hotel after reading a few comments here. They were mostly right. This hotel is really OK nothing exciting but clean and the stuff was very friendly and helpful. It is situated right in the centre, which is good as well.It is a bit old-fashioned and you have a feeling that it looked good in 80's but it is a decent average hotel. No dining hall tho so you have to make sure you ask for your breakfast to delivered to your room!N.F., London "
hotel classic ,"The Pits -- Stay Away Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this hotel. Stay far away. We were looking for a hotel in a good location with a reasonable price, but is an undervalued diamond. We often find such hotels on TripAdvisor, and we will continue to try, but this was definitely not one of them. If anything, it was worth much less than the $50 a night we paid. The rooms were not clean. We had to ask for towels. Three or four people hung around asking for tips. Three guys carried up two bags with their hands out the whole time. And then the security guy came up to show us how to use the air conditioning so he could solicit a tip. The bedcover was filthy and my wife slept on it with her clothes on. The smell of mothballs was everywhere. We left after one night and let them keep our prepaid second night. Yuck. "
hotel classic ,"Old Fashioned But Not Bad for Price Warning - we booked online via a 3rd party site and were sold a &quot;room + breakfast&quot; option. Although you can order room service, they use a good local restaurant and don't have their own kitchen or dining room, nor do they offer any kind of &quot;included&quot; breakfast with the room. So don't trust any other Web site that tells you they do.The building is fairly old, the elevator tiny, the room old fashioned. I liked it as did my husband, but I can see that an American unused to travel outside new US hotels might be a little let down. It's no worse than many places I've stayed in NYC, Rome and elsewhere of the same vintage. It was certainly clean, and the location extremely convenient to the train station and local shopping.ABSOLUTELY Do contact the hotel directly for their airport pick-up service. They'll overcharge you (you pay about double what you would if you're a good bargainer with a taxi on site) but it's stioll not that much and well worth it if you've had a long flight and get in very late at night as so many Int'l flights do. Having the taxi there with our names on a posterboard made a big difference in the insane crowd of meeters and hawkers that assault you when you walk out of the arrivals lounge. "
hotel classic ,"DISASTER! After reading positive reviews on this site, I've decided to book a 4 night stay at this hotel. What a mistake! It seems that there is no logical explanation for the good reviews, except... There is a big sign in the front lobby and in the elevator, saying &quot;Post a good review about us on tripadvisor.com and you can win 2 nights free stay&quot;. Yes, those who stayed there know what I'm talking about... I have personally seen 5 different rooms in the hotel, and they all were horrible. But, that will come later. Now, I'll talk about everything as it unfolded. Nobody waited for us at the airport, despite an arranged pickup. Fine, we go out, haggle our brains out with some taxi drivers, get imho a great deal (750 INR) for a nice AC car. We get to the hotel - they have no idea about our reservation. After lots of talking and etc, they say fine, we'll give you a room to freshen up, and then we'll see. We go up to the room. I have been in many places in the world, as work and a passion for travel takes me virtually everywhere. I have not seen a DISASTER like that anywhere in the world. Literally anywhere. The room is tiny. Dirty. Cramped. Smells like HELL. The bathroom is worse than a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass (or the subway for that matter). And it's really hard to beat a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass. I get upset and go downstairs to talk to the concierge. He says, that he doesn't really understand what my problem is. An Australian fellow overhears our conversation, and starts talking to me. Turns out to be my colleague, in town for the same reason as we are, with another colleague of his own. They've booked 2 rooms, arrived late at night, so they had no choice. They are shocked as well, despite this being far from their first visit to India. Together, we started looking for a new hotel. As we walk back upstairs, I see a cleanup operation in progress for one of the rooms (the door is open). 3 guys, with dirty rags, are busy smearing dirt around the room, instead of cleaning it. One guy, whacking the headboard of a bed (yes, whacking) with his dirty rag, will remain etched in my memory for a long time. Long story short, I got a second room. A higher end one. Yes, it was bigger than my co-worker's. Smelled a little better (still horrible). The washroom though - same story. Anyhow, we had to stay there for 2 nights, after which we moved to Sri Nanak Continental. Look it up, if you care to read my review about it. Bottom line - STAY AWAY from this place and from Channa Market in general. If you can, avoid Karol Bagh too. Not everyone can afford that, though. A couple of additional points: 1. One of our Indian colleagues went upstairs with us, on the night of our first day. He told us, that this hotel is considered to be ok/nice for an average middle class family in India. In other words, I guess it seems bad only to westerners. 2. I got to meet the owner of the hotel, on the second day. He felt genuinely chagrined by my unhappiness. He spent a while talking to me, gave us a duffel bag with the hotel logo as a gift (didn't really want to take it, but my colleague wanted it). He also forgave us some of the additional charges (water and etc). I mean it was for a laughable amount of 90 INR, but it's the effort that counts. "
hotel classic ,"It's New Delhi Above average compared to other New Delhi moderately priced hotels. If possible, call direct to book--much cheaper. Everything worked; A/C, TV, fan, hot water. Asked for and received fresh towels when necessary. Tip everyone that helped you during your stay on the way out. "
hotel classic ,Bit of culture shock This was a good hotel (with air conditioning and a back up generator). Delhi can be quite a shock to the system but this was a nice oasis. The metro was very close and easy to use. The rooms were clean and the front desk staff spoke English. 
hotel classic ,"Likely the best you'll find -- walk to shopping This is a decent hotel in the heart of the shopping district (walk 1/2 block from the hotel and you're on the main street). We stayed at this hotel for several days on two separate occassions and we did notice a big difference between the first floor and the third floor rooms -- third floor is much nicer and quieter. For the price, it's about the best you can find in Delhi, and the location is great for shopping. Also walking distance (about 3 blocks) to a GREAT restuarant -- Udupi (its clean, cheap, and great South Indian food!!). On the down side, the doormen were the lasiest I've seen anywhere, but the management seemed very nice. "

I stayed here for 4 days. It is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the management/staff are good.

hotel dee marks ,"Trust the reviews..avoid this hotel. Myself and 3 other friends stayed at the Dee Marks for 2 nights. We had booked 2 rooms through a travel agent and was told that it was a decent hotel.We arrived late the first night...and were somewhat greeted warmly by the doorman. Hotel was dimly lit and seemed like no one was there. Room: tiny, single beds. Bathroom had basic features...strong water pressure but hardly any hot water. If lucky..water is lukewarm. Hotel employees were not well trained and would linger around expecting and wanting a tip from bringing us fresh towels, to ice to room service. Breakfast was very dissapointing. Bread, and fruit...and can order eggs through the waiter.We checked out and returned to the hotel a night later as part of our tour package and the front desk male receptionist was grouchy and rude...and not helpful nor friendly. Doorman was hovering expecting a tip for opening the door. None of the facilities were open. Hotel is hidden just off the road in the middle of nowhere.Would not recommend this hotel at all...there are many others to choose from and at the rate they are charging...US180 a night..it's unbelievable.Would rate it at a motel standard...a 2 star. "
hotel dee marks ,"With friends 133095454 This Dee marks hotel was selected by me &amp; my friends on certain aspects, like reasonable rate package was the main out of which security was the prime. As this hotel had given a good security but as compared to the rooms were also reasonably ok. But if we come on room package &amp; what hotel is providing on other aspects , then it was upsetting as many things was not in working as I have seen on net like swimming pool , No WIFI Complementary(which was mention as complimentary on net check) It didn't provide aurvedic message as that was also mentioned.&amp; on these main few thing's like swimming pool, WIFI Complimentary, Aurvidic message,etc we saw on net, &amp; as on comparison with other hotels price it was quite reasonable, as it was other part that they didn't provide me those things, for which I was not happy.As comparison with food &amp; sweet item I found many items were not there, as that again upset me.Apart they have good collection of wine.....Rest more or less I have found it overall that the kind of hotel what we see from out side, it is not like that as we have to be care full with cross check of bills, which might be wrong some time as it happened with me.

hotel dee marks ,"Good hotel let down by the staff I am day 2 into a 6 night stay at the Dee Marks. It was booked for me by the company running my training course.Overall the hotel is good, the rooms are clean, spacious, value for money. They have individual air-con, a good TV, and the bed is comfy.But it is let down by petty things, namely associated with the staff.They have a big menu. Its just that for the first 2 nights in a row, they don't have my first choice meal. Cut down on the menu if you can't support it! I even ordered ice cream on the 1st night to be told the chef had melted it! That was a bit worrying; it left me wondering if the fridges worked or he just left it out.They advertise Wi-Fi, but you find out you have to pay for it. I was staying in a Premium room. Perhaps in the super-deluxe rooms it's free. On the 2nd night, I was on the Internet only for it to stop working half way through. I went down to complain, was asked whether my time had run out (it hadn't). It transpires one of the staff had pulled out the network connection so he could plug in his mobile or something!The shower was lukewarm. I skipped it on the second morning, it was freezing! With 35 degrees outside they wouldn't even need to electrically heat it, just use solar panels, but somehow the water was cold.I did a foreign exchange. Only they didn't have a 20 ruppee note so they said they'd give it to me later. OK, it's worth hardly anything, but I'm principled on these things. On the 2nd day I asked again for it and they said they'd sent it to my room. I never got it and I'm not going to ask again, but things like that completely let down a hotel and make it look very unprofessional.Overall, I would say there's nothing wrong with Dee Marks - it's good value for money. If you want to keep it simple, use it for a nights sleep and you're not fussy about what you can eat it'll suit you perfectly. But it could be a really good hotel if they just sorted out all the silly things! "
hotel dee marks ,"ruin your stay at dee marks it was a last min decision to travel to india for business. i tried to book in to a 5* hotel as usual, however at such short notice was imposible. i rang rates to go and was suggested the dee marks, without an option i booked the super deluxe suite with them on the phone at a price of £550 for 5 nights. when i arrived at the hotel they charged my card, then was shown to my room. as a frequent traveller in instantly realised that this was not a suite. i challenged the reception and he told me that this was their equivelant to a suite. after some arguing i reluctantly i want back to my room were i found a brochure outlining there rooms in which i found details of the suite i had reserved. once again i went to the reception with the brochure. to this he said that this room is more expensive and would cost me an additional £550. i explained that at rates to go the prices are confirmed and he should honour the suite as confirmed. he said he would need to confirm it with the manager in the morning if i stayed in the room for tonight.after a 15 hour flight and 2am in the morning i agreed.the next morning i was sceduled for meetings and was away from the hotel for 6am and returned at midnight.on my return i was told that the manager has said that i will have to pay the difference. to this i asked him to check me out and i will go to another hotel. a quick phone call to the manager soon resolved this as the manager agreed to let me have the suite however i didnt recieve the super deluxe suite but only the deluxe suite.i decided that i dont want to spent the duration of my trip arguing with the hotel as it seems to be going that way. so i accepted it.once in the room, the juccuzi didnt work at all nor did any water come from the taps. it was just as well that there was a shower that had luke warm water!!!i was not honoured any of the deluxe complimentary serviceson business i usually swim duing the evenings however when i went to the pool it was disgusting and cloudy. it was no wonder that it was deserted.overall i would not recommend it nor do i feel that it justifies the catergory of a 4* hotel.i can catgorically say that because of the hotel , my business trip was a nightmare.!!?

hotel dee marks ,"modern hotel close to airport We stayed here one night in early April 2007. A new, modern hotel inside, we didn’t get to see the grounds since we got there late in the day and left early in the morning. The folks who checked us in were professional and assured us a taxi to the airport the next morning was included in the price of the room. However, the next morning, a different person tried to charge us for the taxi ride. I argued with him, and when I mentioned that the older gentleman I’d spoken to the night before said it was included, the guy backed off. Not a big deal, just something to be wary of. Maybe get that kind of stuff in writing at this hotel. We ate dinner in the restaurant—it was very good. As we finished, a wedding party arrived and we tried not to get in the way of their photos! Phone in the room didn’t always work when calling the reception desk, and trying to make an international call was a hassle. Nothing special about this hotel, but it is clean and modern if that’s what you want. "

hotel delhi city centre ,"Horrible hotel We arrived to be told that because we had arrived early we had to pay for almost an additional nights rate. As we were tired after our journey and in need of a shower we had no option. It would have been good to have been warned about this especially as we were in contact with the hotel prior to our visit as they were sending a car to pick us up. The hotel is nothing like the photos you see (most of these are actually of the adjoining Ajanta Hotel which appears to have some kind of partnership going with the Delhi City Centre hotel). The room whilst 'cleaned' was uncomfortable in that the sheets and towels were grey and so threadbare there were holes in them, the air conditioning didn't work, the fan very noisy so much so we thought it was going to fall off. Staff wanted money for just about everything, so much so that one actually pushed his way into the room while we were undressing to ask for money for returning the passports they took off us on reception. The desk manager rang us at 6am waking us up to 'double check' how long we were staying despite going over this and writing it down several times.There are a number of hotels on this road that are far better for the same and less money. We stayed in one on our return to Delhi on the same street and it was 50% quieter and more relaxing.Only thing going for this is it's location.... but then there are other hotels! "
hotel delhi city centre ,Cozy and comfortable-good budget hotel I travelled with friends to India and stayed in new delhi at hotel delhi city center. I liked the room in the hotel. Nice and bright. My friends stayed in Ajanta Hotel and we would all walk to Connaught Place to eat Indian spicy 'chat' [thats what the dish is called] and go shopping to Janpath. The staff helped me understand where to go and what to see. 
hotel delhi city centre ,"Awful Hotel I was in this awful hotel, and the staff would try to cheat you at every time. They charge things you haven't consumed, and for that price you can go to a REAL HOTEL, that's a pathetic place, with pathetic staff really. I hope the government would close it for obvious reasons, they cheat everytime they can, you will be robbed! "
hotel delhi city centre ,"Definitely Not Recommended We stayed at this hotel with our 3 children in the Family room. I wouldn't trust any of the staff, they took our passports to &quot;photocopy&quot; details for check-in, but took a long time to return them- they asked us to go to our room without them but we refused and finally they brought them back.The room itself was ok, but not clean, especially the sheets which were changed and changed..but there were apparently no sheets without rips or stains- so we just put up with ripped sheets!The area around the hotel is terrible, the smell, the dirtiness as well as people ready to hassle you as soon as you stand outside.Also for breakfast you have to go to the Ajanta, a hotel just in front of this hotel. You have to walk through a dirty and stinky alley way which may put you off eating your breakfast anyway. The staff there are not interested in service anyway.We definitely will never stay there again! "
hotel delhi city centre ,"Awful hotel dishonest staff misleading website - don't do it Pretty appalling. BEWARE - this has a &quot;sister&quot; hotel, The Hotel Ajanta. The photos on the website are of the Ajanta (which look quite reasonable), not the Hotel Delhi Centre and if you go there, you will find out why. The Ajanta is cheap and cheerful, but this is not even that good. Having looked around before checking in, I challenged the staff and they lied to my face several times, but when I threatened to leave without checking in they moved us to the Ajanta. "
hotel delhi city centre ,"Defination of the word pathetic I was on a business trip to Delhi and fortunately I had the privilege to book the hotel of my choice and unfortunately my destiny took me me to this hotel. people are really pathetic, room service guys look into your purse, as though its their birth right but anyway let me put it like this &quot; its not a three star hotel pls don't get misguided and secondly its a place you are destined to deserve the worst possible respect&quot; "
hotel delhi city centre ,"Escort... Hello,Escort girl entered by the back door with her client, customer of the hotel. Though they were discreet, they were not hiding. This hotel is probably not to recommend for family.Best regards,Stéphane "
hotel delhi city centre ,Good Hotel - just don't try and leave early for any reason! My daughter and I had booked in advance 5 nights at this hotel. We thought it was overpriced for India. The hotel is operated by the Ajanta Hotel and is located behind the Ajanta. Breakfast is also served at the Ajanta Hotel. It had advertised being adjacent the the train station. It was not. The train station was about 5-6 blocks walk and the Main Bazaar and Connaught Place were not even close to being in walking distance. The staff were friendly and helpful. Mr Manik the tour director pressured us into a tour to Taj Mahal in a private car rather than taking the express train as he said it would take the same time and we'd be back before dark. After two nights and finding out that the tour operator was less than honest with us we cancelled our tour and decided to check out and leave India for my own health reasons at 7am. However we were not allowed to do so without paying the full 5 nights I had booked (but not yet paid for). After much arguing and upset and threatening to call the police they settled on making me pay for 3 nights (instead of only 2 that I stayed) and made me write a note stating why I was leaving - I did so under duress just to get out of there. We felt like we were being held hostage. The hotel owner later came to try and talk us into staying but never offered us reimbursement for the extra nights charge we did not stay. Upon returning home I checked the website and they had no right to charge me an extra night.Had this situation not occurred when we wanted to leave early I would have totally recommended this hotel. But since it happened I and feel cheated I would not. Never has this type of thing happened to me at any hotel I've ever stayed at on my world travels. 
hotel delhi city centre ,"Acceptable Room No Wifi I stayed in a &quot;Family Room&quot; with a couple friends. The room was smaller than expected and not especially clean (found condom wrapper next to the bed). The location is convenient, as noted by other reviews. The staff was friendly, spoke good English, and was helpful. We were disappointed that the &quot;free wifi&quot; that was supposed to be included in the room was non-existent. At check-in, I asked about it and was given a password to access the network. 10 minutes later, I tried to access it in the room and found no network. I went downstairs to ask, and they said there was no internet. Go figure. "
hotel delhi city centre ,made my stay in delhi much easier the staff at this hotel makes it a great place to stay. mrs. ravi helped us plan a great trip north of delhi. our trip to delhi would not have been nearly as good if we had not had the staff of this hotel to guide us. the room met my expectations and the breakfast was good. 
hotel delhi city centre ,"good for the location I stayed at this hotel 2 nights, I think the location is great to go to Delhi station, metro, Connaught place. Regarding the room, it is simple - not good and not bad. I felt the price is a bit expensive with total.And this area - Pahar Ganji, Main bazar are very busy so if you'd like to stay quiet and clean area, I dont recommend this hotel. if not, you will enjoy your staying.

hotel delhi city centre ,So Bad 
hotel express 66 ,Not a bit like the website We were disappointed with this hotel.We should have researched it better.The pictures on the website are misleading.My tip would be to make sure you read reviews carefully before you do your booking and maybe only book 1 night at a time until you see a place.The airport pickup was a plus. 
hotel express 66 ,"A++ Warm friendly We booked this hotel from the airport through lastminute.com and we reluctant to leave the taxi upon arrival (basically a very busy commercial street!). Once out of the taxi we were greeted by friendly doorman who took us to reception and from there on the experience was great.Staff were very friendy, going out of there way to help us to ATMs at night (safely) and to get to and from India including help in booking a great taxi service to the Taj Mahal competetive with train fares.The shower water pressure isn't the greatest - but that is possibly a consequence of being in India. Rooms were cleaned - food service was efficient and tasty.Is a bit further from Connaught Place than we thought - but is reasonably accessible by taxi at 60 Rs each way. "
hotel express 66 ,"Sweet Home I Booked through the website- made the most of the offers they have on it- stayed for 3 nights got one night free and also a agra trip free. paid $45 per night though..The hotel is very comfortable compared to the hotels in that locality, seriously. This was my 3rd time in delhi and stayed in express 66 for the first time..excellent i must say..the rooms were clean, the staff very friendly and helpful and in overall a very homely atmosphere they have maintained. the food in the hotel was also good.The other hotels in the same locality are very very shady...i recommend everyone to say who are looking for excellent accommodation in a budget price.p.s also beautiful rooms!!! thumbs up guys.. "
hotel express 66 ,"bad express We were so unhappy with this hotel, When we saw mouse in our room we all are scared and all jerk staff start smiling. Slept there one night because we had no choice. Coughed most of the night because of the smoke-embedded room. Eyes were on fire for a full 24 hours after checking out. Even the guy at the front desk thought it was horrible. I’d call that false advertising of nce and clean rooms. "
hotel express 66 ,"superb staygreat services..................!!! We had serched for the hotel through internet.We contacted the hotel people on telephone,and booked one executive room, we reached Delhi by Rajdhani express in the evening from a hectic tour in calcutta. As said there was a hotel guy on the station waiting for us with a car. we were then taken to the hotel which was hardly 5 minutes drive from the station.At the lobby we were offered welcome drink (Coke).After completing the formality we were taken to our room.The ambiance of the room was very good as shown in the picture on their web site.The services were good and the staff was very humble and polite and always ready to help.The hotel people arrenged for a cab for local sight seeing and a trip to Agra at a very cheaper rate.and the Taxi driver too was very friendly and polite. we stayed in the hotel for 7 days. In all we enjoyed the trip to Delhi.I would always recomend the hotel to all my friends that whenever they visit Delhi they should stay in Hotel Express 66. "
hotel express 66 ,"Great stay we reached delhi at about 10.30 pm.we were exausted as we came out of te Airport the pickup cab was waiting for us as promised by the Hotel.It took 35 min.to reach the Hotel from the Airport.As we reached the hotel lobby a guy was standing there to welcome us with a glass of refreshing drink.Then we asked the front office manager to show the room.we were offered the executive room which was in every way very comfotable AT VERY LOW PRICE according to my budget.As we were late we asked if they could serve us the dinner,and they said yes they can ,so we ordered for Indian food and it came in approx. 25 min. the food served was hot and delicious.We stayed in the hotel for three days and we never felt that we are away from home as the staff was very soft and polite and was always ready to help..............................In short we had a GREAT STAY and enjoyed a lot.

hotel express 66 ,average one I travelled to delhi for business purpose and was looking for some hotel near to pahar ganj &amp; found Express 66. Hotel is quite ok with all the required infrastructure &amp; other facilities. wi fi also good.only thing is the location. situated on narrow road with full of traffic &amp; bit difficult to find. staying there in small budget is a really worth!! 
hotel express 66 ,"not bad stayed here for 2 nights.. good service friendly staff at front office, rooms were clean and was informed that these were recently renovated .. looked better than the ones on the website quite surprising. use of jazzy wallpaper's and wooden paneling not bad.... "
hotel express 66 ,not great i booked this after finding it in a search engine.and reading some favourable reviews. our 3 night stay was our final leg of a month travelling around india. it was very disappointing from the outside and i went to inspect the rooms before we unloaded the luggage as i thought it couldnt possibly be the same place. it is located on a very busy main road home to the timber and aluminuim industry which is in use 24 hours so if you are a light sleeper like me then not ideal. the room and bathroom were clean (apart from the room floor as our feet soon got dirty walking around barefoot after our shower) bathroom is modern and has a shower curtain which is always a plus in india as all bathrooms tend to be wetrooms so everywhere gets wet! there is no restaurant and you have to order breakfast (which was included in our package) and any other food via room service which is then brought to your room. (a service charge of 10% is automatically added to this bill which we didnt know until checking out). as we were out all day sightseeing etc we decided to eat at the hotel in the evening too (also becuase there didnt seem to be any decent eating places around the area) and opted for plain food -macaroni cheese with mushrooms. even this was spicy and made with tomato sauce and cheese just melted on top. 2nd night we had chips and cheese toasties which werent too bad. 3rd night my husband and friend had the macaroni and mushrooms but they both ended up leaving it as it didnt taste right - they have been ill since. i had the vegetable noodles which werent that great either. my friend's husband stuck to eating curries and he was fine. we had to leave at 4.00am for the airport and transfers were included. i had asked for a large car but we were given two small cars so had to travel separately. the male receptionist had to be woken up so we could settle the bill and seemed to fall asleep whilst talking to us! there was some confusion over the complimentary breakfast on our last morning. my husband had asked for plain omelette which turned up with spices and onions. they charged us for one of the juices as we should only have had one glass as complimentary (i think this was the gist of it). i asked to check our food orders for the previous days and pointed out that we hadnt been charged for any breakfasts on the other mornings as it was included in the price so they waived it. nothing is walking distance - connaught place and karol bagh are accessible by a 3 wheeler (dont pay more than 40 rupees for this). on exploring the are we found that there are lots of little shops in all the side streets off the main road. i wouldnt use it again 
hotel express 66 ,"Shocking vicinity but folks try to do their best Arrival was a shock: smog, smoke, dust, metal traiders, wires... Hotel starts from 2d floor. No trees around. Nobody knows the street and the hotel. Exterior looks totally different. But the room was clean, normally equipped. Personnel tries to do their best, but it is not a normal hotel for normal people. It suites for local to stay between railway travel - New Delhi Railway Station is in 500 meters.I've spent 2200IR per night, it costs such a price, but for 5000IR they ask now its better to find a hotel in another quarter. You cant open windows both because of dust, smog and noise. WiFi doesn't work. I was transferred to another room without my will, but nothing was stolen.Finally we even ate there, no stomach problems. "
hotel express 66 ,Good value in Delhi We stayed at Express66 for 3 nights. The hotel was clean and represented excellent value for money in Delhi. The external appearance of the hotel differed from photos that we had seen but rooms are as they appear on the website. The hotel isn't on the best street in Delhi but at least it's not in the heart of busy/noisy Paharganj. Our deal included breakfast but there is no restaurant so this had to be taken in the room which isn't ideal. Overall we would recommend this hotel. 
hotel express 66 ,"A Small Paradise This hotel is a wonder in it self &amp; one of the most beautifully designed hotel from inside. The locaion is a bit crowded but being in the city center one could expect that much of crowd.The hotel rooms are spacious &amp; elegantly designed. The best part is that everything in the room was in perfecty working condition which we didn't find in any other hotel in India. We spent three nights there without any complaints &amp; all the staff members are very friendly.One of the cleanest hotels I have ever seen.Total value for moneyExcellent Service High hygiene standardsFrom the airport pickup till the departure from the hotel, It was a wonderful experience altogether.&quot;DEFINITELY A COME BACK HOTEL&quot; "
hotel express 66 ,"EXPRESS 66 one more 6 to hell I stayed one night in Delhi and I did the choice for Express66 believing in what other reviews said about it. When we arrived the zone seemed devasted by war. the smell around was terrible and everything was filthy and ugly. The hotel entry looked like an ugly storage buiding with nothing nice. once inside the hotel wasn´t that bad looking but when we entered the room many details were wrong firstly we tried to swich on the TV it didn´t work (no conectors). When i told to the staff they send one guy whom after looking the conector he went away and never came back with solution. The room we booked it was a double twin beds and they said on arrival they only had one bed double. When I tried to turn on the light on the bed table the light wasn´t connected either. there we was surrounded by dust everywhere. then the morning came and I had to go to airport early so i went reception and i asked for place to have breaksfast wich was included in the room deal. they said &quot;don´t worry, we´ll take it to your room&quot; so I went to my room and we waited. after one hour the breakfast never arrived and we had only 5 minutes to left to the airport so I went reception and they were there looking at me from a very lazy position showing too much a lack of care.we got so upset that we didn´t want to take the drop off with them and we left without breakfast by rikshaw to the airport for less than half price of the car. we came back to Delhi a few days later and we stayed in Ajanta Hotel about two streets behind where Express66 is located and believe me i got double quality for half of the price. clean nice and very professional staff. who did the votes high rates to Express66? themselves?Fran "
hotel express 66 ,"Do not be cheated! This hotel is run by frauds! We had selected this hotel based on its high review on TripAdvisor and its relatively low price.The hotel is in a very shabby part of the town. There are some abstract paintings on the walls, but that's about it. The room had a damp smell. The hand shower in the toilet did not work. Complaining to the manager did not work. We rented a taxi for half a day to roam around the city. When we got back, within the half day period, the travel desk said the minimum charge for the taxi is a full day. This was clearly not what the manager had said, who was not there later.We asked for advice on how to go to our next destination - Jaipur. The travel desk just wouldn't give any advice other than taking their taxi at a high price. When I enquired about bus routes, he gave me a myriad of logic not to take a bus. At first he said there were no AC buses to Jaipur, then he said there are no buses except at night, then he said it takes 12 hours to reach Jaipur, then he said it costs Rs. 800 for each person. Each of these were a lie.One reason for selecting this hotel was their free wifi. But it was a hoax, it did not work for more than 5 minutes.One guy slept on a sofa in front of our room, and we could hear him cough the whole night.At check out time, came the biggest shock. When we had taken the taxi, the manager said the charge would be Rs. 800 per day. But they billed us Rs. 1200 for a day! The room charge was Rs. 2999. When we said we wanted to pay in USD, they used a conversion rate of 37 Rupees instead of the bank rate of 40. It's not the few hundreds we paid extra, but the attitude of ripping off customers, that we disliked. "
hotel express 66 ,"Very good The hotel location is not very good, but the rooms are news, comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have a great time in Express 66. "
hotel express 66 ,"A Spotless Hotel in New Delhi My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Express 66. We reached Delhi very late at night on March 19th, and the hotel pickup service was at the airport on time, awaiting our arrival. Honestly, Express 66 is not in the best part of town, but upon our entry into the hotel lobby, we completely forgot the streets outside. Our check-in was quick and efficient, and we found the staff very willing to cater to our needs. In fact , I had been in touch with hotel's MD several days prior to our arrival, and he was extremely friendly and accommodating of our requests. The rooms were very reasonably priced (something difficult to come by in Delhi) clean, and well kept. The MD has taken obvious care in maintaining the establishment thus far. A very creative and contemporary collection of art is also tastefully displayed throughout the hotel. My family and I also enjoyed several meals from the hotel's kitchen, and we agreed that the food was well prepared, and tasty. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who requires a clean and reasonably priced place to stay in New Delhi. You will certainly get more that what your money pays for. "
hotel express 66 ,"Express66 is worth each penny I am from Canada . I stayed in Express66 not once but twiceand have reservation for the third time. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean.

hotel express 66 ,"new and clean hotel The hotel is new and it is quite small (there are only three floors with a few rooms per floor). The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are new. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are very eager to assist customers in any ways possible. Our experience dealing with the staff was very pleasant and they made our stay quite comfortable. It can get a bit noisy at night if you have a room with a window towards the street (which happens very often in hotels in Delhi, unless you are in the more quite areas such as the Diplomatic Enclave).

hotel florence ,"Comfortable hotel to stay in Central Delhi The Florence Delhi is a small chain of moderately priced, small and friendly hotels. The staff worked very hard to please. The hotel was clean and comfortable, certainly a 3+ star.This hotel was very clean and comfotable, the folks were very friendly and helpful with all of our needs. The street is quite busy and it isn’t close to the airport, but we wanted a clean and cool hotel and this was perfect. The dining room/restaurant remains open until very late and the food is great. Food was good, both western and Indian . They were happy to please. It is a relatively quite neighborhood in the WEA area, with a quiet stroll in a residenital area and small park near by. "
hotel florence ,Truly a nice hotel Hotel Florence is truly a nice hotel to be in especially when you want a reasonable or mid range hotel.This time I was here with my family and I needed few extra facilities like airport pick up.I felt really happy when the staff told me that we provide picks up facility to our guest @ reasonable price.They received us at the airport and we were in hotel within 35 minutes.We were provided a beautiful room with a comfortable bed.Room services were also round the clock and I felt that all the staff members have very jolly and friendly nature.We appreciate the services of the hotel at such reasonable rates. Over all the staff was very help full and i am glad that i stayed here. Good job keep it up 
hotel florence ,"Better pay more but stay at **** The place shown on the map has nothing in common with real location of the hotel and thus it was one of the reasons I had chosen Florence, I was very disappointed. The breakfast on the first day of our stay consisted of scrambled eggs and toasts with jam though we expected buffet. We were told that only 4 rooms are occupied, so there is no reason to cook for a buffet, and when we asked for at least some vegetables, we were offered to pay additionally. And there was no hot water when we arrived at 11 o'clock at night. The rooms faced a street, so it was too noisy. Then we wanted to change the period of our stay at Florence, but staff could not help us at all saying we should do it at local Indian travel agency though we not able to connect it. The only good thing about the hotel is a building itself, nice and clean, but it is not a sufficient reason to stay at Florence again. "
hotel florence ,"Excellent hotel in Budget Class The Hotel Florence is a comfortable place in &quot;Budget&quot; style, conveniently located close to Delhi’s most famous shopping hub called Karol bagh, in fact every shopping location was near to the Hotel.Actually we were on a shopping tour to delhi so it suited us the best. The hotel facilities and rooms are of excellent quality.We had booked Deluxe Rooms through www.resavenue.com but got upgraded to higher category after speaking to the Hotel General Manager.We enjoyed our seven days tour.The Pre arranged air conditioned coach for Airport pickup, Sightseeing Tour &amp; Agra Tour booked by the Hotel Manger was very comfortable &amp; luxurious.

hotel florence ,"ok hotel but a bit antiquated and not exactly cheap... We stayed at Hotel Florence just the final night before flying back home after 2 weeks of travelling around Rajasthan. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly, but the whole décor was rather old and stuffy…Delhi overall is very expensive compared to the rest of India, so the double room at Rs3000 was probably not bad for Delhi standards, but an absolute rip-off compared to what you could get in other places for that kind of money.Our room rate included a Welcome Drink (a glass of super-sweet Coke…could have done without that) and breakfast.Breakfast buffet was ok – not very big and “very Indian”, but ultimately you could also get non-spicy food if you asked for it. "
hotel florence ,"Excellent hotel in good location Hotel Florence provides precisely what you would expect from a Budget hotel in the category: Good accommodation and absolutely first-rate service.The rooms are small, but well appointed and well maintained, with Mini Bars and excellent restaurant on the top floor.In a city where quality and price do not always carry the relationship that one would anticipate, the Hotel Florence is a very safe choice. "
hotel florence ,"Big Mistake! Staying in this hotel was a big mistake. Next time, I will do my research on tripadvisor and stay somewhere much nicer. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.SUBPAR ROOM: The room and bathroom were of decent size and cleanliness. But upon entering, we noticed a musky and unpleasant smell. We paid a little more for a &quot;deluxe&quot; room with a window, but the view was horrifying - there were hundreds of tiny beetle-like bugs crawling around outside on the other side of the window. In fact, a couple of these critters actually made their way into the room (not sure how as the windows seemed to be sealed). There was also an inconsistent supply of hot water. One of us got hot water at night but the other was forced to take a cold bucket shower the next morning.UNDESIRABLE LOCATION: The surrounding neighborhood is run down and far from the colorful marketplace I expected. Definitely not a nice area.POOR SERVICE: I couldn't find information about internet availability in the guestbook, so I called the front desk and asked. They told me that there was internet available on the 4th floor where breakfast was served. I specifically asked if the internet was free and the front desk confirmed that it was. While I was using the internet, I heard a lot of yelling in the kitchen next door. A man walked in from the kitchen (I assumed he was the boss because he could speak english whereas the rest of the staff spoke little, if any, english) and he proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay for the internet in a very unpleasant and brusque tone. I politely explained that I was told internet was free, but he dismissed my claim and demanded to be paid. I didn't want to upset him any more than he already was (I'm pretty sure he was the one doing most of the angry yelling in the kitchen) and it wasn't that much money, so I just paid him and left. "
hotel florence ,"Did not like it very much This place is okay, it is clean and the staff tries to be helpful. We were still quite disappointed, because the place is anything but cheap for Indian standards. Most of all, its location, Karol Bagh, is inconveniently located and an unattractive neighbourhood. It is both far from the train stations and Delhi's tourist spots. During night time it looks like a slum.We got one of the quieter rooms, which are located in the core of the building. These rooms though have no window or only one leaing to a tiny, dark light shaft. Our room was quite small, the ones to the road side are much more spacious, but the traffic din there is unbearable, if you sleep longer than until dawn. The cleaning staff makes matters even worse when they start to roam the place in a most noisy manner from 6am on. It seems that it takes all day to clean one floor and they will not stop shouting and throwing things on the floor! "
hotel florence ,"Take it From a Solo Female Traveler The deluxe room, where I stayed for two nights, was a bit small but not cramped. It was passably clean but the smell of moth balls that were placed in different parts of the room was an assault to the senses. What I liked most was, as a solo traveler, I felt safe here. I also appreciated that they immediately replied to my email asking about room availability and then reservation. Well, it also helped that I also gave them a call. Ditto for giving referrals for package tours by local travel agencies. "

The room service is excellent and so is the cooperation we got from the reception staff who are really friendly and helpful. Location is ideally suited for shopping but rather conjested and noisy; though very safe. On the negetive side ,1. they should keep replacing the soap/shampoo etc in the bath. Those looked reallly dated ! 2. The TV reception is poor , though the TV itself was an LCD flat. They should get DTH connection.Overall a very nice place to stay on a budget. "

hotel good palace ,"A nice stay at the good palace Was pleasantly suprised, I stayed in the Good Palace for 1 night before my tour and 2 nights after my tour and to be honest wasnt expecting it to be too great due to the low cost of the rooms and general lack of appeal on their website advertising. However I was wrong I enjoyed my stay they have helpful staff who at first may seem a bit standoffish but will do anything for you if needed, they also have great room service (some of the best food I tasted in India), and their rooms are neat and nice. I would have given it an above average rating due to good value for money but they were refurbishing the lobby during my stay and it was a bit chaotic so it wouldnt of been fair to give a higher rating. For the low cost of the hotel I think it is a nice place to stay, I would go back. "
hotel good palace ,"Basic but decent - you get what you pay for I stayed at Hotel Good Palace as part of a package deal with Namaste India Tours (which turned out to be a fabulous bargain as a whole). Our room at Hotel Good Palace was clean and decent, the walls and furniture were well maintained and the TV was functional with a basic selection of local channels. The AC was also fully functional. The bed, chair and wardrobe were basic but in good condition, and the bedding was clean and comfy.The bathroom was a bit disappointing - the shower didn't work (we had to make do with a bowl and bucket) and the shower curtain was awfully mildewed. It was fairly clean (and usable - there was running hot water, thankfully) but it certainly did not meet the standard of the room itself.The staff were very polite and helpful, and the laundry was fantastic - I still haven't been able to find anyone who can iron a certain top of mine the way they did at the Good Palace.Location wise, you must bear in mind that this hotel is right in the middle of one of the busiest parts of Delhi. Therefore, to expect peace and quiet is simply unrealistic. If you MUST have peace and quiet, this is not the place for you.All said and done, you will get what you pay for with this hotel. It's a budget hotel for travellers looking for a decent place to stay at an affordable price. You won't pay premium rates to stay here, so don't expect a premium hotel. "
hotel good palace ,"Noisy Stay ast the Good Palace First of all, the hotel is located in a noisy part of the city (central sales area). The rooms were small and poorly insulated. You could hear people talking in the hallway, talking in the building next door and the noise from the vehicle horns. Second, on the first night there was no hot water in the morning after 7:30 AM. Third, the brakfast was a C- at best. On the good side, the staff tried to be helpful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they like noisy places! "
hotel good palace ,"Low end barely acceptable Used as part of and Intrepid Tours basic trip. It was a basic hotel. A little dirty, languid staff, few amenities--our air conditioner was ot connected, unsure whether it would work if needed. However, it was quiet and had the basics necessary for a stay. We had breakfast there and had no problems. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Perfect place in Delhi Really nice place - close to the metro station, helpful staff, clean and tasteful rooms. We felt really lucky to have found this place. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Great Hotel for the price. Been in India for over a month hubbing in and out of Delhi. Stayed at the Grand Park 4 differnt times. This hotel is a great base for exploring Delhi and Northern India. For the price, you will not find a cleaner or larger hotel room. The sheets are spotless, AND the blankets are freshly washed. AC unit worked great, hot water was good, hotel is safe and the area is fine. Breakfast is included as if tasted good, nothing spectacular, but no complaints. It's only a 40 rupie taxi to the train station. 3 blocks west of the hotel is a huge market street with loads of restaurants and shops (including McDonalds =)). The actual street the hotel is on is not the nicest place to look at... but it's fine and safe. My wife walked around at night and didn't feel uncomfortable.The owner Mr.Madan is a wealth of info, and will book tours and help you book train and flights. As a travel agency, they of course take commession on trips, but for trains and flights, he does it at cost using Indian online travel companies. His advice and help has made our trip extremely easy and has been really helpful. Internet is availble using their computer. No wireless internet in the hotel though.Listen, at the end of the day, here's why we stayed and continued to come back: It's very clean, it's in good shape, it's safe, and they provide good advice and will help you out with any questions or problems. If you're coming to Delhi, give this place a look. "
hotel grand park inn ,Deos not leave a lasting impression We stayed a night and wanted to extend for 2 more nights but the hotel staff was very greedy and the rooms are old. We moved to other hotel. 
hotel grand park inn ,"Clean affordable hotel to get away from the Delhi chaos After having a bad experience in another hotel we checked into the Hotel Grand Park Inn. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Even though on the ground floor the hotel entrance was sandwiched inbetween shops, don't let that deter you. Once inside it is a quiet atmosphere (ok, as quiet as Delhi can get!). Our room faced an alley way so it was fairly quiet. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and in good condition. We were given a bottle of water per day, per person. This was a great benefit! Other hotels we stayed in we had to buy water. Breakfast was either an Indian breakfast or American breakfast. Basically Chai and Parantha or eggs and toast. We ate in the breakfast room upstairs, but you could also have it delivered to your room. A couple of times we had dinner and lunch. The food was fairly inexpensive (for a hotel) and tasty. I also had laundry done, which was done on the same day and delivered to my room. My friend, who was travelling with us, used the owners computer a couple of times to check her email. According to a couple of the reviews, it was far away from the train station etc. We had a car and driver so I did not have a problem with this. Also, someone mentioned that the rickshaw driver didn't know where the hotel was, well Delhi has millions of hotels, the rickshaw drivers don't know every one! Make sure you keep the address with you, tell the driver the area first, then the street name, if anything the driver or you can call the hotel and they will give directions. "
hotel grand park inn ,Only For One Day Very isolated - long walk to train station. Taxi/rickshaws tell youthey know where it is but don't. filthy street even by Delhi’sstandards. Grim breakfast. Redeeming feature - flashy showers - ifthey worked properly! 
hotel grand park inn ,"Surprisingly good hotel. We did not know what to expect, since we never been to India. For us India was at first a bit of a &quot;culture shock, there is still a lot of poverty, and the traffic? OMG.But that's a first impression.To be honest the area didn't look all that appealing at first.But the hotel is surprisingly nice.The rooms are pretty big and clean and better then a lot of hotels we've been to in European countries.The staff was always helpful, and the owner let us use the computer as much as we needed.When we had a question there was always a staff member to help us.Called taxi's for us and told us what the price would be...helpfull.And they gave us good recommendations what to see and where to go.India and the streets of Delhi are a long way from what we are used to in the Netherlands, the subway at rush hour? ehm ..an experience.But I must say when we came back in the evening to our hotel, it was a nice feeling.And the breakfast was simple but good.We made a trip that many take, Delhi-Jaipur-Agra(...Taj Mahal)-Orchha-Varanasi and from then on into Nepal to end the trip (3 weeks) in Katmandu, Nepal.We took buses, trains,taxi's, tuk tuks, riskha's....and elephants.In all those cities we've had hotels, but I must say this one was one of the nicest ones.We've been to European hotels with 3 or 4 stars, but this hotel was just as good.I can recommend it fully. "
hotel grand park inn ,"“Racial Discrimination” They like only white europeans and can discriminate you beouse of your low potential to pay for tours, your cloor they can trouble you be being bad to you and will give you a very bad room like dungeon "
hotel grand park inn ,"Great service and after care The staff here are fantastic. Always polite and very quick to respond to all your needs. What was particularly great was that after we had checked out they kept our bags for us whilst we went sight seeing and gave us a room after to freshen up before our over night train journey to Jaiselmer. Then two weeks later on our return we arrived in Delhi around midday but our flight wasn't till 1am. They kindly kept our bags for us whilst we did a last bit of sight seeing and they also gave us a room to shower and freshen up before our flight home. The rooms were very clean and tidy, basic but comfortable. The after check out care was fantastic, they really went the extra mile. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Excellent value for the money Grand Park Inn is certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed at in India. The rooms are simple but large and clean. The room service and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The area is centrally located, busy at daytime but very quite during the nights. I have tried other hotels in Delhi but keep returning to Grand Park Inn. "
hotel grand park inn ,basic rooms with great service!! What this hotel lacks in luxury features it sure makes up for in friendly and helpful staff.This is a very basic but very clean Hotel with some of the friendliest staff members I have ever met during my years of travels! No request was too big and everything we asked for got promt attention! They have a small room for breakfast and it turned out that the mornign get together there was quite entertaining as we met fellow travellers from all over the world.It is located in the outskirts of the Karol Bargh market close to Metro and shopping. We asked the staff for pointer to a few restaurants and ended up having some of the best Indian food we had on the trip. Dinner for two for $ 6 !!! left out of the hotel then first right and a few blocks down the street you will find Santos. It felt safe at all times to walk around the neighborhood.They arranged pick up as well as transportation back to the airport for a very resonable price as well as a driver for one day worth of sight seeing. (even though the driver wanted to take us shopping a few times but a firm no got us back on track... I guess the drivers still get a comission for bringing in tourists to the bazaars..)I exchanged money here as well and got a better rate than at the exchange office in the airport.We asked for a nearby internet cafe... the owner let us use his computer for our needs!All in all a basic but good place to stay! 
hotel grand park inn ,"Great little safe haven I stay here one two occasions, once at the a start of the holiday and once at the end. One both occasions the rooms where immaculate. The food was good. The service while not warm is very efficient and trust worthy - no pressure to book tours etc. And they reliably booked taxi's for us to go to the train station and the airport.The location was initially daunting- but after afew days in India I realised this was the norm - the Karol Bagh area is actually quite good, not touristy so you don't get too much bother. "
hotel grand park inn ,"O.K for price. Good resturant nearby. This hotel is okay. The area is fine, not the best, but safe to walk around. Lots of markets and shops to go to. There is the most awesome resturant as you follow the hotels directions to the nearby resturants. (Ask at the desk where there are resturants. Generally it is turn left out of the hotel to the end of the road, take a right and walk straight down that road.) Its on the right hand side and is called Sandoz. It was a receommendation to us and we are so glad we went. Get the malai kofta (only nice one I actually found during my stay in India) and dal makhini. We didn't get chicken as its always a bit risky in unknown resturnats in India, but my partner ended up wishing he had got the butter chicken as the food was superb!There were ants in the room, but they stayed to thier section far away from the bed. They had obviously made a route across the room that they followed each night. They weren't too much of a bother and were the really tiny ones. Only thing I would say is seal all bags. I came out of the shower to find they had all disappeared and were in my handbag after a sweet wrapper. I didn't like the fact they were there too much as not too keen on insects myself, but like I said. They generally weren't a problem (aside from me leaving sweet wrappers in thier path.)Room is spacious, as is the bed and bathroom. Good, powerful shower with plenty of hot water. It was clean and I was overal impressed with it for the price (£30 for the night with expedia.) Breakfast is included and is fine. I asked simply for toast and they made me 3 pieces of toast, an omelette and a bannana. I think they give you that whether or not you want it! The breakfast room is small and has one long table for all guests to sit. It is a bit like a hostel in that sense, but it's not too bad really.I'm not sure if I would recommend or not to my own friends. Backpackers or travellers will find it luxury. Those used to hotels, might not find it the best. I usually stay in hotels and thought it was okay, but the location is a little difficult to walk around. Very busy traffic down the roads (as with all india) which if it's your first time can be a little scary to walk around. All in all. It is okay. Didn't try the room service menu (don't think they have a resturant) but the prices were good, the sevice charge cheap as chips (in fact cheaper) and there was quite a large variety of food on offer.It is okay for just a night. I probably wouldn't stay more than 2. "
hotel grand park inn ,Will Not come Again The hotel did not pick us up from the airport. The rooms were very basicand at cheaper price we stayed in better rooms in Karol Bagh as wechecked out after one day. Not a good choice. 
hotel grand park inn ,"Great place to stay in the madness of Delhi Staff were so helpful! My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights. Staff were extremely helpful and looked out for us as we were unprepared for the craziness of the city of Delhi. They were flexible with dates also as we went to stay in Agra for one night during our scheduled stay and came back. Staff could not have been more helpful or friendly, the location was quite central, food was great, and they provided us with assistance with taxis, prices of taxis etc. and surrounding places to eat. The rooms were spotless, the beds were very comfortable and we had no complaints whatsoever. By the end of our trip to Delhi we felt that it was a safe place to stay and a refuge away from madness on the streets!! I would highly recommend it. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Good place to crash between airport and station with helpful staff We needed to crash for one night between a late flight and an early train. We needed somewhere cheap, basic with a good airport pickup all of which were satisfied.The airport pickup was ahead of schedule and polite. It cost 650Rs for 4 people which seemed to be about the going rate.The room was basic, but had free bottled water clean sheets, towels and bathroom.The staff were very friendly and helpful even when we had to wake them up at 4.30am to check out! Staff provided a late night Thali for us which was very tasty.Could not comment on location or other hotel amenities. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Shows Ageing Air condition was not working, doors make sound while closing, salt stains in bathroom wall, life seems old too, and surrounding area is bad, economy hotel. Good for few hours stay at cheap price. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Comfortable reasonably central hotel with great staff. 5 nights in Delhi as a single girl in town can be an exhausting business! You need somewhere where you can excape the dust, dirt and noise and with feeling terrible with the flu and no way of changing the flight home, this was a cosy enough place to hole up with some lemsip! The staff really looked after me well. The only improvement I'd suggest is a more western menu for room service and a no smoking policy in the hotel! The hot water was not reliable but was there 70% of the time. Air conditioning likewise! Staff could not be more helpful. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Great place to start your trip The hotel was very clean, hotel staff pleasant and helpfull and the travel desk within the hotel is great! Location is OK, although not many rickshaw drivers knew it, fortunately the business card of the hotel had a route description. Room is not that cosy but very clean and therefore a great place to start our trip! "
hotel grand park inn ,"Undoubtedly the nicest hotel staff I've ever met!' On the strength of what I had read in TripAdvisor about inexpensive places to stay in Delhi, I decided on Hotel Grand Park Inn. I traveled to Delhi on my own to attend a wedding in another part of the city altogether. Not to worry--not only was Vikash, the driver from the hotel, there to meet me at the airport, but the hotel's owner, Mr. Madan Pai, arranged for Vikash to drive me to and from the wedding parties...and also to take me to interesting sites around Delhi on the days when I had no activities planned. I cannot over-exaggerate the kindness and attentiveness of the staff--nor the helpfulness of Mr. Madan Pai. When my plans changed--I was invited by the bride's family to stay with them the last part of my visit--Mr. Pai did not charge me for the remaining two nights for which I had booked--and then presented me with a gift upon my departure. I can honestly say that I felt very sad to be leaving this hotel and its staff....now THAT'S a first!! I am a very frequent international and domestic traveler, and I have never felt such a friendly atmosphere within a hotel. In addition? Nor have i ever felt compelled to write a review for TripAdvisor! It was Mr. Madan Pai who suggested that Vikash take me to 'AKSHARDAM'--the most enormous temple/compound one can imagine--containing a lotus garden, a main temple containing over 20,000 statues and a 108' long/10' high elephant plinth. it was only finished fairly recently---and it is absolutely mind-boggling to imagine how this incredible place could have been built in only five years--many visitors have never even HEARD of it- DON'T MISS IT!!

hotel grand park inn ,"Very attentive and respectful staff to female travellers My daughter and i stayed at the hotel Grand Park Inn during our stay in Delhi. We found the hotel staff and management to be exptremely courteous and helpful. Although the hotel is not located exactly in the centre of Delhi, it's only a short trip away by autorickshaw or taxi, and a welcome relief after being in Central Delhi. The street itself is not great, as it is in the centre of the &quot;automotive&quot; trade, but the management, Mr Madan Pai and his staff have many suggestions and travel services...We found the pick up from the airport and train station very reliable and safe.The rooms were more than adequate, with clean bathrooms, air conditioning that works clean and the food and room service were prompt and delicious. The only thing to mention is that the pillows were really hard and uncomfortable...We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Delhi and wanting a safe and friendly place to stay. "
hotel grand park inn ,"A Safe Haven in the Midst of Motorcyle Mayhem Arriving at the Hotel Grand Park Inn I was warmly greeted by the staff and graciously assisted to my room on the 3rd floor, thankfully way above the hustle and bustle of the street below. This was very comforting as getting there was a crazy ride... Diwali was only days away so the traffic was more frenetic then usual. In addition to this the taxi driver had difficulty finding it (I recommend printing out a map to assist your driver). I took a Police Registered taxi from the International airport and it only cost 250 IND rupees... a real bagain!The hotel is surrounded by auto shops primarily for motorcyles. It is a real treat to see how the locals 'pimped out' their bikes and hatchbacks ;) Day and night there are men everywhere however I was never harassed or felt unsafe.The metro is not that far away however getting across the busy road to access it is a real adrenaline rush... not for the faint hearted! Also in close proximity is the Karol Barg markets. Here you can get some excellent bargains... local and international products of all kinds. You can hire a driver through the hotel for 850 IND rupees for up to 8 hours, giving you time and security to access the many wonderful sights of Old and New Delhi (negotiate where you want to go with the assisitance of the hotel staff before departing as not all drivers are fluent in English).My room had a fan and air conditioner so the heat didn't bother me. There was also plenty of hot water 24 hours a day... yippee! The food for dinner was delicious. Breakfast was simple however tasty.The staff (managed by the charismatic Madan) were very friendly and always asked that I was happy.Overall I had a very positive experience and never felt unsafe as a female solo traveller :) "
hotel grand park inn ,"Very clean hotel with helpfull staff We have started and ended our India trip in this hotel. In total we spent 3 nights there and we can only recommend the place. Rooms (we had booked standard room) are very clean, comfortable and with reazonable size. Staff is very helpfull. The manager makes everything possible to satisfy his guests. Pick up &amp; drop off service from/to the airport is also reliable. We have also booked a taxi driver for a day through the hotel. Make sure that you preset your route with him before setting off. Otherwise you will be brought to several markets. After we complained about it, the manager made sure we get a different driver for the next day and we had no more problems. For our next stay in New Delhi we will definetely stay there again. "
hotel grand park inn ,A gem of a hotel During my recent stay @ Grand Park Hotel Inn I was more than impressed with the high level of service experienced.Nothing appeared to be too much trouble and all requests were carried out efficiently and most importantly with a smile.The rooms were very comfortable clean spacious and well appointed. The location was perfect with easy access to markets bazaars and sightseeing areas.Transport was pre-arranged with the hotel.The driver was always punctual courteous and very patient! His driving skills were exceptional along with his intimate knowledge of the city. I would have no hesitation in recommending anyone who wants to experience the real Delhi its wonderful people and high level of friendly service to stay in this gem of a hotel 
hotel grand park inn ,"I'd definitely book this hotel if you're on a budget and are looking for a good base to explore Delhi. The facilities are great as it is very near to Karol Bagh market and an auto rickshaw ride away from Connought place. The hotel located in the heart of city near biggest main shopping centre. Comfortable, well-equipped big and clean rooms. The staff are great and very efficient both in the hotel and restaurant. Perfect and helpful hotel employees and services. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Friendly management - good service - convenient location We only booked a day before we arrived and it appeared that the booking from the Hotels.com website had not reached the hotel.

The owner/manager (?) Madan was so welcoming, full of restaurant recommendations (good ones), helpful hints and couldn't do enough to help us.Would recommend the Grand Park Inn to anyone wanting to stay somewhere that's not a global chain, has some Indian characteristics and wants good friendly service.

hotel grand park inn ,"Have a Safe Conscience! My friend and I read great reviews of Grand Park, so we decided to call a couple days ahead to reserve a room and rate. It turns out the quoted rate by phone was less than any online offers, and when we arrived after a convenient airport pickup for a reasonable price, we were given a large corner room with more bed-room than we could have needed. The mattresses were high quality, and the room was nicely modeled. The bathroom had a separate shower (a rarity in Indian hotels), and included extra amenities such as soap, shampoo, and shaving kits.By far the best part of our stay was the staff. The owner/manager helped us with everything, from arranging a low-priced visit to Agra, food purchases (the hotel provided food is only adequate) and restaurant recommendations (Sandoz, nearby, is to die for), and even beer runs. The staff was overly helpful at times, but that's difficult to complain about. The location was great to reach some of the best parts of Delhi and New Delhi, and the night market nearby was nice. The hotel was easy to find, as well, because of its proximity to the gigantic Hanuman (monkey god) statue down the road. The most important part of my stay, besides the quality of the hotel and staff, was that I never felt like anyone was taking advantage of us. The value was good, and as much as was provided, nothing extra was asked. I will definitely return on my next stay in Delhi. "

The staff are all excelent ,they were the same boys as last year and they all rememberd us. The servis and clenliness is second to none, and the organisation was excelent. Although the hotel is only part of any holiday, with the Grand Park Inn, the hotel is one part of the holiday we know we dont have to worry about. We intend going to Delhi again next year, and because of the way we are treated by everyone concerned, we will be staying at the Grand Park Inn yet again. "

hotel grand park inn ,"Service Excellence beyond par ;-) Having stayed at Grand park inn on 2 prev trips and experienced for myself the service excellence and clean comfortable rooms, i booked my parents on their India holiday with Mr Madan Pai, who efficiently also arrnaged their entire tour for them. But what prompts me to write this, is this: During their last few days in India, it was God's grace that my parents were staying at the Grand Park Inn, as my mother,an asmathic, fell critically ill. Mr Pai immediately took matters into his hands personally, ensuring my mother was hospitalised, that my father ate, he even topped up my fathers mobile phone with airtime from his personal funds, and gave my father over a hundred rupees in small notes so that he could travel by auto to and from the hosital. He ensured that at all times one of the 'room boys' remained with my father, who was emotionaly a mess with my mother's illness. Then, when my mother's condition worsened, he personally contacted us in South Africa and informed my husband of the situation. When we arrived in India, my mother was critical,in ICU and was transfered to another hospital in Vasanth Kunj, which in Delhi's traffic was 45min away from the hotel. Mr Madan provided us with a car and driver, at his cost for 8 days; further, when i had to remain in india with my parents after my husband returned home, Mr Madan saw to my and my fathers every comfort, ensured we ate on time, and then also topped my mobile's airtime to the tune of Rs400, and refused to allow me to reimburse him. His constant concern at my mother's condition was touching, and every one of the 'room boys' prayed each day for 'aunty's' recovery. With God's grace my mother recovered and almost a month later we travellled back home; again transported to the airport free of charge by Mr Pai, who made a personal visit to the hospital to bid my mum goodbye. I cannot express how grateful my family and I are at this man's genorosity. No other hotel, no matter how much fancier, would have given us the same care. Not that the Grand park Inn lacks in comfort: the ample sized rooms, complete cleanliness, friendly and attentive staff will put many of the other more expensive and fancy hotels to shame. This is a true gem of Delhi and to Mr Madan Pai and Team: I salute you! from Prinitha Dowlath and Family, South Africa "
hotel grand park inn ,"Came to India sick...left India well! We visited India for two weeks and the Grand Park Inn was our base. Mr. Madan Pai and his staff were the ultimate in pleasant but serious service and hospitality. The trips we booked with Mr. Pai were A-1.

hotel grand park inn ,"simple economy service stayed there for 3 nights with 2 female members of my family. This is an economy hotel we paid 2200 rp per night for a triple room. The location of the hotel was not ideal for lone female travellers - the area is made up of car repair companies - therefore, there are very few females to be seen within the area. The area is very noisy... The hotel manager was grumpy the first few days but cheered up on the third day. A few recommendations for the rooms; tea/coffee making facilities; a spy hole on the doors; there is no iron available in the hotel. We booked a car/guide via the hotel - the driver insisted on taking us to specific shops on route - i'm sure he was on commission as these shops were definately in the business of ripping off tourists. He even insisted on taking us to a restaurant despite our repeated requests to go to another restaurant. The location is ok if on a shopping trip to karol bagh. The hotel restaurant was more like a small dining room - not comfortable especially during busy periods. Breakfast selection was limited. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Excellent location decent rooms great price We were very happy with our stay here. The rooms and bathrooms were immaculate and spacious, with polished marble tile floors and sufficiently comfortable beds -- everything seemed near brand new. The staff was helpful and knowlegable. Breakfast was served in a conference room where we met fellow travelers - local business travelers and others from abroad. Grand Park Inn was an excellent value.The location in Karol Bagh was great. The hotel was on a small busy Delhi street; a cow was parked nearby one of the days we were there. We were walking distance from the Delhi metro, which, if it takes you where you need to go, seemed to be the best way to get around Delhi -- it's a new system with trains that come every 3 minutes or so, although it does get PACKED during rush hour. It still beats sitting in dusty Delhi traffic. We were able to explore all over Delhi from our base in Karol Bagh. We did, however, have to cross over a very busy intersection near the Hanuman temple to get to the metro station, so some might prefer a short rickshaw ride. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Excellent hotel grand park inn Delhi india.We had booked this hotel initialy to start our tour in india but it happened so that arrangement was cancelled and all due to terrorism that happened in that time in mumabi our flight was cancelled,and when contacted the management they were so considerate and without any fuss it was dealth with sympathy and we eventualy stayed their upon return leg of the tour ,I found the hotel manager Mr Madan Pai a true gentleman who greeted us with utmost courtsey and welcomed us with warm heart that impressed us greatly ,service and accomodation was excellent a true peaceful experience throuhjout the stay will recommend highly to all visiting delhi a clean hotel with reasonable charges and above all no value can be put on the hospitality and service a truely honourable management and creditworthy staff definetley 5 star in my opinion.Will visit and stay always at GRANDPARK INN HOTEL. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Object lesson in customer care I cannot speak too highly of the manager and staff at the Grand Park Inn, who were unfailingly polite, helpful and friendly. I must single out the manager, Madan Pai, who put together a 2 week tour of Rajasthan, Agra and Varanasi for us, gently adjusting our planned route and expectations. The driver, Malkit Singh, was also very attentive to our needs and safety, and was always there on time to pick us up at the airport (we used the hotel on 3 separate occasions). However, most of all, I would praise them for the way they looked after us, especially my partner, in the wake of the heart attack I suffered one night, ensuring that everything was comfortable for her at the hotel and providing personal accompaniment on her visits to the hospital with no charge. Similarly, the necessary travel rearrangements after this were made gratis, and with great concern for my health.The hotel is quiet, though situated in a non-tourist market area, and provides good food at very reasonable prices in the spotless rooms. The staff will cater for your every whim. This is not a modern, soulless hotel but has a quaint charm. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Loved the Hotel After an extremely long search of trying to find a reasonable place for a reasonable price to stay, we luckily found this very nice hotel in new delhi!The hotel was spotless &amp; the room very pretty luxurious for Delhi standards, specially for this price range!The location was pretty good, close to &quot;city centre&quot; - Connaught Place, although you will need to cross some dangerous roads to get to the metro...but that was all part of the fun of dodging traffic in India! &amp; being seen as &quot;alien&quot; taking the metro funny ;0)The manager was extremely helpfiul &amp; I recommend to use him to get a travel package set-up to see the golden triangle &amp; other locations, this will save you looking for hotels in other parts which was also extremely difficult, but Mister Pai, the manager arranged good hotels in other cities like Agra, Jaipur etc. The breakfast area is a little small &amp; the food is so so, however the good part is that you meet other travelers in the same room and share experiences, which is very nice as well.So Generally speaking, this hotel is an excellent value for money for your stay and Delhi &amp; comfortably.If you decide to take the travel package, I recommend you to ask for a driver called &quot;Rajan&quot; , we enjoyed the travel with him, he was a great guide &amp; fantastic company during the whole trip and an extremely funny guy, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! "
hotel grand park inn ,"Very nice place I spent three weeks in the Grand Park Inn because I was in Delhi for business and had made some bad experiences in other places.The first night I had to spent in the annexed lower-priced hotel next door - this did not make me very happy, but then the next day I could change and I liked it.As I stayed there for an unusually long period I need to say that I enjoyed it!The room was very big, the TV worked well, the fridge even had a generator (which continued working during elecricity blackouts), the hotel staff was friendly (all young males), but sometimes struggled with their English. The Hotel Manager was also friendly. He and the other guys always helped me when I was looking for something or trying to figure out a &quot;realistic&quot; taxi price for a certain route.The breakfast, which was included, was basic, but okay, but was served to my room (there is a sort of dinner room in the other hotel, which was not very cozy). The room was cleaned on a daily basis and the towels (2-3) were always fresh. The bathroom - usually a nasty place in lower-priced hotels - was surprisingly clean. I had a room next to the street, which was quite busy, but in Delhi you always have the noise problem.The area is certainly not a posh touristic neighbourhood, but across the street there was a convenient supermarket and also about hundred meters away a liquor store to buy beer or wine. The metro was a 5-8 minute walk away - quite convenient.In general, I had a good time at the Grand Park Inn and would definitely recommend it to people who want a nice and clean hotel for a quite fair price (compared to others) with a good public transportation close by. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Great Rooms Bad breakfast This was our first hotel in Delhi, and we found everything apart from the breakfast and location to be very good. The location is fairly near to a metro however crossing the busy roads is required, which for some, may be a little tricky outside of the toursity areas where its a free for all, It's also in a fairly chaotic area, you will get to see a more real delhi than connaught place though. The breakfast was abysmal, Very little choice and what there was was not good at all, The foil wrapped toast mentioned before....not good. On to the good, The rooms were very spacious, we only had a standard and felt it was far more than most hotels gave us, the staff were very friendly and helpful, we got a car organised free to take us from the airport on arrival and to the station on departing free of charge, and they gave us good directions without pushing us to certain places. So all in all a good stay Between a 3 and a 4 definetely. "
hotel grand park inn ,"An oasis of calm in frantic city! Stayed at the Hotel Grand Park Inn in January this year. The staff and the owner/manager were lovely - especially the manager who allowed us to use his computer for free to do an on-line check in at the airport! He arranged for us to be taken to restaurants and collected later but did not charge - we just tipped the driver.The rooms were very clean, breakfast adequate although the toast comes already buttered and wrapped in foil which makes it extremely soggy!! I requested mine to be left unwrapped which was much better.The Hotel is in a strange part of Delhi - lots of motor shops, motor bikes etc (not forgetting our omnipresent bovine friends!).Tuk tuks into the centre of Delhi or to the extremely spotlessly clean metro were inexpensive. The markets are wonderful, people very kind and friendly everywhere it seemed and at no time did we feel threatened when in Delhi.Once you get over the initial culture shock, India is a lovely place to visit and this hotel is great as an escape from the frantic hussle and bussle of the city - extremely cheap too - £125:00 for four nights B&amp;B for two of us including transport to the airport about 50minutes drive away! "
hotel grand park inn ,"Our stay was peaceful and pleasing! While searching a decent clean hotel to stay during our Delhi-Agra trip, I really did not know that, I have to spend lot of time in the web to find one for our budget. We wanted a very clean and decent hotel. After a lot of review study from different websites, finally me and my wife decided to call up Hotel, Grand Park Inn.Got really good response for our call.Till the moment we stepped into the allotted room, we were kind of tensed about not getting our expectations met. Our main concern was the cleanliness of the bathroom.We were glad to see the clean bathroom.Food was good.Felt homely, calm and safe.Room interiors were above average.We did not have any major problem other than little bit of noisy A/C and had to call up reception every time we wanted hot water except morning hours. Management need to train the staff on communication skills. "
hotel grand park inn ,great place to stay The Grand Park Inn is a good clean hotel with great staff you can ask the manager to arrange a tour for you he does this with clean comfortable hotels with your own driver at a very reasonable price The hotel is quite near the centre of Delhi in a safe area you can ask the hotel to arrange a pick up and drop off for you at the airport The hotel is very good value for money I can recommend this hotel 
hotel grand park inn ,"good idea It was almost impossible to choose a reasonable place to stay in Delhi. Reading reviews left no hope. But this hotel was quite good after all.location - not far from CPmanager - competent (very unusual)rooms - quite big, newly renovated and literally spotless - highest mark for cleanliness!breakfast area - too small, people have to waitbreakfast - rather poorroom service - quite good ( if you close your eyes on a bit of cheating)Generally - practically best solution in that price range "
hotel grand park inn ,"no good we stayed 3 nights, but our experience was terrible. A lot of noise and the staff sometimes was insistent. the sheets weren't clean. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Not a Great Experience I honestly view myself as a low-maintenance visitor, and I'm amenable to most circumstances. The Grand Park Inn is a very reasonably priced hotel in Delhi, and generally clean with good morning breakfast. But its location - Karol Bagh (the auto/motorcycle district on Delhi) is a less-than-nice location, despite its proximity to the subway. And the management is awful. My key complaints: (a) no driver from the airport although scheduled (plane was 1/2 hour delayed so driver left); (b) after day 2 (of 3), they move me to a sister hotel despite my request to stay; (c) they give me a room in the new hotel that has no out-facing window and is immediately adjacent to the kitchen, which is active and *really* loud for all hours except 2-6 am (so those are the hours I slept); and (d) they tell me in the morning I don't have a complementary breakfast (although I did at the first place), requiring me to speak to the manager who has me get the phone number for the manager at the other hotel (he actualy told me to go over there to talk to the manager at the other hotel rather than worry about it himself). There's more. And all this might seem a bit petty, but the frequent level of dishonest and disrespectful treatment really added up. I was very unhappy with the ongoing lies from the management. Overall, I'd rather have paid more for better treatment elsewhere. "
hotel grand park inn ,"Pluses and negatives The room rate is cheap by Delhi standards, and the hotel is clean. Hot water can be problematic. On our first night, we were shifted to a nearby hotel (Blue Bell) because the Grand Park Inn was full. The elevator at the Blue Bell got stuck between two floors after a power outage, and we were in there for 15 mins with lots of people shouting outside and making my mother quite nervous. If you get shifted to other hotels, please do not use the elevators for your safety.The area around the Grand Park Inn is not good. We got conned by a nearby optician store (Punjab Opticians) that the Grand Park Inn owner (Mr. Madan Pai) recommended, and the whole area seems unsafe for women at night for sure. A taxi driver nearby also tried to con us. Someone later told us that this area is shady.I also recommend NOT purchasing the tour to Agra and Haridwar that Mr. Pai offers. Besides the high price in comparison to hiring private taxis, our driver (arranged for us by Mr. Pai) forcibly took us to a restaurant called the Maharajah Palace where he gets commission and other perks. We told him not to take us there on the way back from Agra, but he still went there and drove on the wrong side of the road in order to get there (other motorists were all staring at us incredulously, which rarely happens in India where the driving is crazy as it is)! Food at the Maharajah palace costs five times what is typical in Delhi. The driver also took us to a place called Little Taj in Agra which is entirely useless so that he could get a commission on our purchases. On top of all this, the driver asked us if we wanted to hire a pandit (priest) from him for our trip to Haridwar on the next day!!! The guide at the Taj who was also arranged by Mr. Pai kept pressuring us to have a professional take our photos.Also, on the following day's tour to Haridwar that we purchased from Mr. Pai, if you can not tolerate cold, do not stay at the Khanna Palace (also owned by Mr. Pai). They have nonexistent or terrible heating and do not provide a personal room heater if needed. We ordered an extra bedsheet, and got a wet one.Overall, the cleanliness and the relatively low cost of the hotel is a plus that is negated by all the negatives I listed above. "
hotel grand park inn ,Clean and comfortable We were very impressed with our room at Hotel Grand Park Inn and especially the fact that the bathroom had a bath!There wasn't much hot water and you had to call the reception to turn the hot water on and that took 10 mins to heat up. But that was fine and we got used to that.The food was good and the service also. 
hotel grand park inn ,"Great stay in Grand Park Inn We just returned from our first trip as a family (parents, 3 boys) to India. It is not easy or cheap to book a two rooms in at least reliable hotels. To book the hotels, I relied heavily on the reviews of other travellers and found them all very helpful. The Grand Park Inn was our in our first destination New Delhi and also our fourth stop, en route to Kolkata. It was a very pleasant and reliable experience. The hotel is really central located (just go out and take a taxi, it only takes you about 10 minutes to Connaught Place). What Iliked most is that you actually feel you are in India when you walk outside, the atmosphere is still a bit laid back with even the occassional cow walking by. It is central to most markets and there are very nice and clean restaurants nearby. The rooms were sparkling clean and service is immaculate, including some personal tourplanning. We will definitely stay there again. "
hotel grand park inn ,"We had a great Stay! We had a great stay in this hotel. Find the room and hotels is nicely maintained. Rooms are clean, service are excellent! Almost wasn't sure if the previous visitor was staying in the same hotel.For 25USD a night, we had a suite with 3 beds. I guess is designed for a family? Room is large &amp; clean, and the bathroom is clean and with good hot water supply. Sounds insulations can improve a bit as we can hear dogs barking throughout the night, though that didn't really bother us.Manager was very helpful in advising us on where to go to find food, internet, and organise day tour for us to go to Agra or transport to airport. Overall find the staff very friendly and helpful. Though the reception desk tends to over rely on their boss, sometimes we find that every question goes back to this big boss who is very helpful! Hence, only problem is if the big man isn't there sometimes or is busy, you cannot get your answer quickly.I agree the stuff can appear pushy for tips. We had 3 porters 'helping ' us with our two hand carry luggages! Though we did tip a bit (not every time), we find the staff deserves them as they really go out of their way to help us. For example, they went outside to look for beer for us after 10pm, because the kitchen was closed already, when we ordered room service! We also tried their bargain tasty dinner there and is great indeed!Overall, we find this hotel at a great location (5-10mins walk from metro station, 2 stops from Connaught Place), and great value (as long as you don't expect 5 stars hotels for less than 25USD a night!) and good service. We will definitely go back again if we do visit Delhi again, just hope they will maintain their high standard, as this looks like a pretty new hotel to me, and I am hoping that's not the reason why they are so good now!

hotel grand park inn ,Hotel ist nur etwas für Packpacker oder Hartgesottene 
hotel grand park inn ,Lo de Grand le pega mejor por el excelente servicio que por el tamaño. 
hotel grand peepal ,"Ok hotel - depending on the price you get. We were originally set to stay at the Hotel Ananda. Apparently the management staff from the Ananda has moved to Grand Peepal and when I emailed to confirm our reservations they said they would switch us to the Grand Peepal for the same price, 1800 Rps/night for a deluxe room. We had complimentary airport pickup - the driver was there on time and very pleasant. This was helpful having just arrived in India. The rooms here were decent - ok size and generally clean. The bathrooms were a typical wet bath style. Our drains didn't work properly and so our bathroom was covered in a half inch of water everytime we showered. The water pressure was also poor, but the water was warm. The toilets did not seem to accept toilet paper very well. The rooftop restaurant had good food and we had breakfast included in our room price. The location of the hotel is very good for browsing the Karol Bagh markets and is also close to the Metro for getting to other parts of New Delhi.Our first day the management offered to take us to get a free map - this included a hard sell on a car and sightseeing for the day. We ended up going at what we are sure now was a very inflated price. I would suggest just getting a taxi on your own. Overall this was an ok hotel, but if you look at the website it shows the tariff as 4000 - 5000 Rps per night. This hotel is certainly not worth that kind of money by any stretch of the imagination. "
hotel grand peepal ,"Not Recommended We were originally booked to stay in the Ananda Hotel and were then moved to this more expensive hotel as apparently the Ananda was full - despite our reservation. The lobby of the Grand Peepal is a bit drab and depressing and the rooftop restaurant didn't really appear to be a going concern whilst we were staying there. The room was ok, although we stayed for 3 nights and it was not serviced once. The main problem with this hotel was the service. The only time anyone at the hotel displayed any interest in us was when we were ushered into a travel agency and given a hard sell about a driver for 10 days around Rajasthan. After we declined this offer we were pretty much ignored for the rest of the time. We were given no information about local services, such as the metro (the easiest way to get into central Dehli) or restaurants etc.We were asked to provide feedback when we checked out and I said that a little more information about the local area would have been helpful. The man at reception then took my feedback, read it and then started to argue with me about my feedback, that I was wrong to write that, that I should have asked more questions... which I found unprofessional.Also when we were leaving we booked an (overpriced) taxi to the train station through the front desk. The taxi never showed up. I kept asking the reception staff about the taxi and they kept fobbing me off, but not actually doing anything about it. Eventually I just flagged one down from the street because we were about to miss our train and they tried to tell me that i couldn't take that taxi as I had booked one from them. Naturally I ignored them. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. "
hotel grand peepal ,I was not impressed I wouldn't stay here again. We booked in for 3 nights but started searching for a new hotel after the first day. The rooms we stayed in were ok and the bedding clean enough but there was this overwhelming bad smell that I could not take.The general staff (waiters etc) were very nice but the people at reception could take a lesson or two in etiquette. The food I ordered was really good too.They refused to give us a receipt as proof of payment unless we paid them an extra 1000 rupees! The man and woman at the desk started got into a fierce argument about something and didnt care that there were guests in their presence. 
hotel grand peepal ,bad service hotel My stay in this hotel is not good because hotel is not clean and bad service . Very dirty smell in the hotel because outside of the hotel is a big dustbin where all the hotel waste integrated but no manage it . Rates of the hotel is very high compare to quality and service. 
hotel grand peepal ,"Excellent Stay This was second stay at Grand Peepal. I visited Delhi in May also and the service was excellent then too. The front desk staff was very attentive to my needs and safety, especially as a single woman traveling alone. I found the staff to be courteous and helpful. The Hotel is in a very convenient location near a great market. It’s just off the main street so it is quite. The rooms are clean and the air condition worked well. The bathrooms are modern and clean. The refrigerator in the room was a pleasant convenience to have food and water in my room. The roof top restaurant was very good. WIFI both in my room and in the lobby worked well. For the price this is a great value. Especially for first time visitors to India. I am returning in 2009 and will be staying at Grand Peepal again for a 3rd visit. "
hotel grand peepal ,2nd Name of Home is Grand Peepal I booked this Hotel Through a Travel Agent (Incredible Heritage Tours) my stay here was for great. the staff was helpfull and the reception always warm welcoming!!!I was here on bussiness but also Travelled abit.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL TRAVELLER AND ALSO THE BUSSINESS PEOPLE. 
hotel grand peepal ,"I Do Not Recommend This Hotel At All ! I stayed at this hotel for 32 days and I couldn't stop myself for not posting any review about it cuz I'm pretty sure that most of India tourists search Internet to find a proper hotel before traveling just like me. I hope this info help them.First of all notice that here is not a luxury hotel and those tourists who look for economy hotels may choose this one. this hotel is small but located near a big shopping area so I could buy foods, water, fruits and juices, etc very easily. shops and restaurants were accessible.CHECKING IN:When I arrived I told the lady at reception that I already have booked a room on the phone but she was not aware of it. It was funny that they picked me up at the airport but she didn't know any thing. she called the manager and finally noticed about my reservation which was done a day ago.She requested my passport to write my information in their records. she also asked me to write my address there. I just wrote it and signed it. she was waiting until I write the address completely and after I delivered her notebook and pen, she crossed a line on my address and told me very rudely and impolitely that the address is written in a wrong row. &quot;write it here..&quot; she said.I was shocked about this kind of behaviour with a new traveller who wanna stay there for a couple weeks. (simply she could write the address again in the appropriate row by herself)So I told her that I'm regret and wanna change this hotel right now !!!! please hire a car for me so that I will visit the other hotels and will choose another one. here is not good for me at all. she didn't expect this reaction from me and so she tried to cover her fault. &quot;Sir, we can hire a car for you tomorrow morning, It's night now !&quot; she said respectfully ! I knew that they understood their stupid fault and they wanted to keep me at least for 1 day and charge me for 1 day. but I didn't agree and I told her that I will not pay you and I wanna change my hotel cuz I'm not happy with your behaviour. She talked to the other staff in Indian language for a couple minutes and after that they all tried to keep me there. they called the manager to come and talk to me very friendly so maybe I stay there but I told &quot;no it's not possible. I need to move right now. hire a car please.&quot;In fact I didn't want to move to any other hotel cuz I was not sure about the other hotels and the quality of their services. I just wanted to scare them so that the next time they will understand how to treat with a new traveller. they finally hired a car but begged me ALL not to book any other hotel...Finally I came back to the same hotel and decided to stay there before they cry !Inside the hotel:The worst problem was their Wi-Fi connection cuz It was going down occasionally and this was annoying. It was not reliable at all. for example It was going down at nights up to morning in the next day and I had to call at reception and complain about it every 3-4 days. Although they tried to fix it but the problem was more serious than just restarting the modem and changing some cables! I'm pretty sure that this problem still exists there...My room was very clean and bed was comfortable, bedsheets were also very clean. Foods were good but most of the times they were a bit rare. some kinds of kebabs were always NOT available. dishes were clean but not always. Hot water was always available but I had to call at reception 10 minutes before taking a bath. Air conditioner was not working properly.Room service was not decent and was always with huge delay. some times I had to wait for 2 hours and call them several times to come and clean my room. I'm sure they were trying to ignore me cuz It was free !!!Resturant was not bad but do not try &quot;cheese sandwich&quot; at all! their cheese is not tasty at all !!Refrigerator was working properly. Room was safe. you can be sure that no body will steal your belongings...Staff were very polite and friendly.The hotel was in a busy area but my room was scilent.Checking out:They were just trying to rip me off. for example I didn't have Indian rupees. all I had was Euros and they tried to exchange it with the worst rate !! they wanted to make a huge profit in exchanging euro to INR but I didn't agree with their rate.So they had to exchange it with the real rate at that time. breakfast was free of charge for me but they included all the bills for breakfast in the final receipt and tried to trick me but again I didn't allow them to rip me off! I took all the bills for breakfast OUT and asked them to calculate again !! they wanted to charge me for 1 more day but they couldn't cuz I was smarter than them !They didn't give me a penny discount. for example I owed them 300 rupees which is around USD $7 and I didn't have rupees. but they wanted it and I had to exchange my 500 EUR bill to Indian rupees so that I could pay them 300 rupees and this is very funny when I stayed there for 32 days.I was smarter and didn't allow them to rip me off after all.BUT NEVER TRUST THEM !My overall review:You can find very better hotels with cheaper prices easily in just walking distances around this hotel. so I don't recommend this hotel at all. I also moved from this hotel to a new hotel after 32 days.One important tip:THE PRIMARY PRICES THAT INDIAN HOTELS GIVE YOU ARE ALL NOT REAL !!! ALWAYS TELL THEM THAT THIS IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND WE CAN NOT PAY FOR IT. THEN THEY WILL LOWER THE PRICE TO THE REAL PRICE AND THE REAL PRICE MAY BE HALF OF THE FIRST ONE GIVEN. "
hotel grand peepal ,Hotel correcto 
hotel janpath ashok ,"Big improvement in this hotel Was having some trepidation about staying here due to earlier reviews but was pleasantly surprised at what we came across in the hotel. Yes the temporary reception &quot;room&quot; is not ideal but new reception due to be ready by next January. The rooms were excellent, large, clean and well equipped. However we were in rooms which have been upgraded and, as far as we could find out approximately half of the rooms still require upgrading. Restaurant food was fairly good but a fairly limited choice. Bar area was okay but dirty from dust from construction work (probably would be closed by EHS in UK). "
hotel janpath ashok ,Nice Location The only thing good about this hotel is location. It located in Connaught place which is the heart of Delhi. The rooms are very big &amp; spacious but not well maintained. The room service is okay &amp; food definitely not very palatable. Only thing is that you can just walk around &amp; have good joints within 10 min walking distance. 
hotel janpath ashok ,LOcation was good Not worth the rent charged; food not very good; rooms look old with stained walls; albeit large; should be maintained properly; may not stay their the next time 
hotel janpath ashok ,Average Stay Hotel Janpath location is good and close to connaught Place.Service is slow. Front desk response is average 
hotel janpath ashok ,"Rip off I know this review is coming late but when I saw the hotel on the dirtiest list of India I had to weigh in. It was the worst rip off of my life. Paid 160 USD for one night at what was supposed to be a 4 star hotel. It was just horrible. Driving up to it I knew something was wrong as it looked like a govt. dept building. Lobby was shabby but proved to be the best thing about it. Lifts, corridors and path to room was filthy and badly lit. Room was horrible. Wouldn't lock properly. Toilet was grimy. Beds were uneven. It was 12 midnight and I couldn't find another hotel. Slept with a chair jammed against the door. Stay away. "
hotel janpath ashok ,Good Restaurant with live Ghajals program The hotel is okay but we liked the restaurant more because of its good food and live ghajals program. its good to be there with family and friends and enjoy the party. 
hotel janpath ashok ,"Hated It We stayed at Janpath to get our infant son out of the Diwali noise and air pollution.When we arrived the staff were doing their Diwali worship in the lobby and we had to wait over 20 minutes just to check in. Not a single member of the staff volunteered to help us check-in and get us to our room before they were done. We were left hanging around in the lobby (frigid) while the staff sang songs!!The beds were too narrow and uncomfortable, the wooden tiles on the floor were creaky, the AC was turned on full blast turning the room into an ice chest, the food was too full of chillies and not really good anyway, the hotel staff were shouting across the corridor to each other (terrible when the sound echoes.)To top is all, they have the nerve to call the Janpath a 4 star hotel and charge a &quot;luxury&quot; tax.It would be hard to call this hotel a 2 star on all counts.We would not stay here again or recommend it to our friends. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Awesome Build I was sponsored by CNN-IBN(news channel) a trip to Delhi to watch the 1st ODI between India-England in March 2006. Upon reaching Delhi I was transferred to Hotel Janpath for my stay. The hotel was awesome and I have never experienced such incredible service before. Dinner was the best I had over there, and the accomodation was simply satisfactory. It was an old structure but was simply magnifiecient in its serenity and beauty.If you want a mix of the old and the new then this Hotel is a must. "
hotel janpath ashok ,loved the way they treat guests i loved the way of their welcome to the guest......the facilities were good.........there is slight problem of room adjustment but it can't be mind.......overall its a good experience 
hotel janpath ashok ,"OMG! yikes. I didn't stay at this hotel. I was strapped for a hotel at the last minute &amp; this hotel was in the CP section of my Lonely Planet guide. The first shock was the location- while its in the CP area, the hotel is located off of Janpath in a dilapidated looking side alley. The building from the outside read &quot;MAJOR DIVE&quot; all over it...dirty and unruly. I took a hotel tour of the rooms which was like going through a depressing mental asylum maze of green walls, semi dark hallways and flourescent lights, where they were on. The rooms I was shown had NO windows and while it seemed like it might be clean, my 200Rs budget hotel at Cozy Hotel in Pahar Ghanj was looking a lot more chic, clean and safe by the minute. The only visual peace I could stammer was the restaurant patio area which was the only place that wasn't as claustrophic and offered a bit brighter of a vibe. This was a HOLE, not a 4-star hotel and definitely NOT worth the price they're asking! There was no way I could stay there &amp; I even considered throwing my LP guide in the toilet. I ended up going back to my Pahar Ghanj budget. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Not worth it!!! First of all, this hotel's lobby is very cold but I wonder what happens to the A/C when we reach the room. Food is very overpriced at a cup of coffee(if ordered through room service) costs more than Rs.80. Food is good in the Sagar Rathna restaurant which provides South Indian fare but the Gulnar restaurant which provides a variety of cuisines is just about okay and priced at slightly higher rates. The rooms are quite spacious but have minimal facilities. The cupboard is also small. The walk from the lift to my room was so long that I felt I was walking from the left wing to the right wing of the Salarjung museum. Also, do not expect fast billing before 12 noon and do give notice atleast 1 1/2 hours before. Hotel staff are not very friendly and seem quite cold. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"possibly the worst value in the world We were booked into the Janpath by a reluctant colleague when we simply couldn't find anywhere else. It is not filthy, and there was hot water but that is about all that can be said in its favour. The staff were unhelpful, the food below average, the rooms ill equipped. Many rooms appear to be derelict and abandoned, or being refurbished. We both agreed we had stayed in far better hotels in major European capitals for less than a quarter the price we paid here. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Not a place to lay your head I did not stay at this hotel but I did visit prior to ouractual stay there. I toured the hotel withhotel staff and they graciously showed us a roomon the 4th floor. The location of the hotel is greatand by the appearance driving up it looked veryfavorable considering the price. The lobby was small, not grand at all but clean and presentable.The elevators were the old English lift type andworked well. Upon our accent to the 4th floor,I was the first to get out of the elevator. Directlyto my left was a part of the hotel or not, I wasn'tsure that was in the midst of construction. Noplastic tarps, no barriers, just a hallway with tools,sawdust, wood and construction materials thrownabout. The hallways were bare and deserted. Itreminded me of a mental hospital you saw on TVfrom the 50's. The room doors were old, didn't see safe and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I would not spend 10 minutes in that room let alone a night. The furniture was damaged, the pillows looked 20y ears old and it was so very dingy and dirty everywhere. Black marks from dirty hands wereon the walls. The bathroom was completely disgusting. Granted, old and clean is fine, this was old, filthy anddisgusting. I looked in the tub and it was peeling. Crusted dirt and scum was around the rim. I couldn't bare to look any longer. I had to leave. We cancelled our reservations forthe return trip to Delhi. I'm so happy we went to check it outbefore checking in. Not recommeded unless you will sleepanywhere. "
hotel janpath ashok ,Good 4 Star HI This is Alam. Me and my Friend stayed in this hotel in the month of October and we found hotel is good 4 star.You will find all the basic aminities that 4 star hotel should have. overall its good 4 star . next time we will stay in this hotel. 
hotel janpath ashok ,"Grim Stalinist and depressing I booked into the Janpath for a couple of weeks because I was going to be in Delhi for work. Big mistake. I had wanted a decent, serviceable, comfortable hotel, with good business facilities and an OK restaurant. Unfortunately, the Janpath was really none of these things. I knew I wasn't going anywhere as posh as the Imperial or the Oberoi, but I could have paid far less than I did at the Janpath for the facilities I got. It had nothing: no email access, a grotty bar, a restaurant I didn't really try (the in-room breakfast was bad enough), a terrible dysfunctional TV with about 2 channels and poor reception, the world's loudest air conditioning (sleeping at night was a problem), windows that didn't shut properly, and faulty electrics that constantly threw out sparks. In its defence, I would say that my room was quite large and quite clean. It was not comfortable, but it would have been acceptable at a 2* price. Unfortunately it came at a 4* price. I would also say that the staff were very pleasant to me. The laundry service was efficient and well-done, too. And the location is obviously very good. I became almost affectionate towards the place by the end of my stay, but it was a bit galling being next door to the Imperial.I would certainly not consider the Janpath if you are visiting Delhi.If you want a cheap, basic hotel, there are plenty cheaper than this one of the same standard. If you want a comfortable but good value hotel like a 4* should be, there are dozens of better options - The Claridge's, for instance, or any of the international chains.Despite a few redeeming features, you really will be better off elsewhere. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Filthy Dirty Great location just off the circle, but upon check in I was thoroughly disgusted. I was given the filthiest hotel room I have ever seen! The &quot;suite&quot; consisted of carpet that looked original and contained more dirt than my garden. The sofa and other &quot;suite&quot; furniture had grease stains across the entire headrest areas, the spilled items under the warm, empty refridgeration unit should and probably did invite bugs. The windows did not close properly, sucking the mildly cool air from the air conditioner right out. The bathroom walls had mold, including the shower which only provided ice cold water. Don't be tempted to stay - even for a minute. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"What a rip-off! The Janpath would be lucky to receive two stars in any other country. The location is good, but the prices are ridiculous and the rooms are very basic. I had no hot water for the three days - the airconditoner sounded like a truck engine - and they had the nerve to charge me a &quot;luxury tax&quot; on checkout! Three nights cost me nearly six hundred Australian dollars. Do not stay at this hotel! "
hotel janpath ashok ,"There are better 2 star hotels than Hotel Janpath We were in Delhi early Dec 07. We were told that we could not our first choice of hotel because it was fully booked. The agent told us that she had booked a 4 star hotel which was better than our first choice, so you can imagine our horror when we booked in at the Janpath. Its a run down hotel which should never be classed as 4 star. The rooms we were given were very basic and from the looks of the doors it looked like the rooms had been broken into. Thankfully we were there only for two nights. I have stayed in better 2 star hotels in India. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"very clean rathole the hotel janpath (located on Janpath road just south of connaught circle, between the Imperial and the Shangriila) is a government run hotel, part of the ashok group. the location is fantastic. The rooms were surprisingly clean (including the sheets) however, be mindful that this hotel is pretty much a rathole and would be a two star hotel in the US. that being said, I had hot water and a very large room,and TV with many English channels (probably cable or a satellite system). the bathroom was clean (the towels were grungy - best to bring your own) and the room didn't smell bad. The price was about $150 with taxes which seems to be about average for this class of hotel. Sure, the hotel was run down and dingy. The paint on the walls was peeling, and the furniture was very basic. However, it was a large hotel, many storeys, with shops and two restaurants. I ordered room service and the food came quickly, it was good, and I didn't get sick. I wish the room had cost $50, and not $150, and then it would be good value. However, the location was great, it was clean, .and I got a good night's sleep there. "
hotel janpath ashok ,This hotel doesn't even deserve 1 star. When we made reservations we were told this hotel was a 4 star. This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star. The rooms were dirty. no hot water at anytime. Bathroom had mold everywhere. Staff was rude. We were promised a free breakfast and ended up having to pay for that. I didn't mind paying I just wanted to get my things and get out of there. 
hotel janpath ashok ,"Janpath overpriced for mediocre stay We usually stay with family when in Delhi but they were out of town, so we had to find a hotel which was safe and clean. Our four-year-old children were visiting India for the first time and have a complicated medical history, so we didn't want them getting sick either. Janpath was recommended to us by cousins who also had children visiting India for the first time, and they said they had a good experience. We paid way too much for the stay we got - 4700rs/night. The room, though large, was very worn, the bed was inadequate sized. The bathroom was as clean as can be expected from this kind of hotel, I guess, not well-maintained. We had several maintenance issues while there, but the staff was quick and effective in responding. Room service was prompt, but often messy in service. The food was reasonable, both in taste and price. I was told this hotel was a good transition from America to India. It is not. You will feel the culture shock when you stay here. Our train for departure was in the evening, and we asked for delayed check-out, but they charged us a whole extra day for it. The area was safe and my kids didn't get sick on the food (we bought our bottled water elsewhere). Still, I wouldn't recommend this hotel, because you could get a similar hotel for much less, but you have to be careful in Delhi. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Bad bad bad!!! I stayed in this hotel with family for one night. It was terrible. The rooms were very dirty with torn carpet. The carpet looked like it has never been cleaned from several years. It is definately NOT a star hotel. It was much worse than some hostels where I have stayed.In spite of all this, the charges for food were like 4-5* hotels. They charged 45Rs for a cup of tea and more than 200Rs/person for useless breakfast.The staff was rude. At first they told that the breakfast was complimentary. But after we had the breakfast, they said it is not. After lot of arguing, I had to pay for that. All of the staff was desperate to get tips -- no matter how poorly they have maintained the hotel and how poor their service is.AVOID AVOID AVOID this hotel. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Awful The hotel was an absolute disgrace, there was no cleansiness we stayed 1 night and we did not even unpack our suitcases slept in our clothes. They insist on payment upfront which should of got the alarm bells ringing. DO NOT STAY HERE "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Like a Prison! We prebooked the hotel online with Asia.com. When we arrived at the receptionist, it didn't too bad. Once we got to the third floor where our room was, the ambience resemble that of the under funded 1950s Lunatic Asylum. The room was horrendous - windows were covered with wooden board. The electric sockets were hanging out. No hot water at all despite the fact that the staff came up twice to fix it. The staff was aggressive and all they wanted was charging extras as much they can. Be very careful before you pay the bills! A deperate hotel - only to be used in the crisis. Not recommended to stay more than one night! "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Absolute no no for this hotel Terrible, horrible, pathetic, despicable, bad can't find enought negative adjectives for this hotel. Rooms are like they have never been cleaned, bathrooms are like everyone in the hotel uses one single bathroom. Very dirty. Can't imagine this hotel is still functioning. Service very very bad. no water to drink ... just plain out lousy. "
hotel janpath ashok ,"Terrible experience - Avoid it! My experience was terrible. I called the day before to confirm our booking with Janpath and it was confirmed. When we got to Janpath from Jaipur, we were rudely told that there was no reservation. I showed the reservation from the internet and he was challenging me that it was not a reservation. He was very rude. It was only after he was going through his reservations did he finally find it and then his tone changed. We had two other bookings for the hotel and he said that there were no other bookings for the future. We even phoned the booking agent twice and they confirmed that there were no other bookings. More later! The room was not comfortable and for the first time we both decided to forgoe on the bath/shower as it was stained. It was also dark and noisey.We were glad to be out of there in one night.Now back to the horrible experience...while I was touring around, we found out that Janpath hotel charged us for one night as a no show (I found this out by email). I immediately contacted Janpath and they said that we did not show. They then argued with me that we did not cancel. I told them we confirmed with hotel and booking agent twice that there were no other reservations. They were very argumentative and would not relent and this went on and on for months. I told my credit card company and they finally stepped in and looked after it. Word of warning...get the name of the front desk person and be cautious about your bookings. They tried to get the money out of us and did not succeed. This was the only real negative on an otherwise wonderful adventure. "

hotel jukaso down town ,"There has to be a better place.... We had a choice of this hotel or Yorks Hotel. Sorry to say our group was booked in this place. Upon check we only needed 5 rooms, the hotel was not confirmed with a credit card and the front desk had a fit and we had to take the 6th room. After a grueling 1 hour they agreed to give the single rate for the person in the room. The staff took up most of our groups baggage and very clearly stated they wanted a bigger tip then what the individuals gave. We had 4 rooms with inoperable showers/tubs. The water backed up the drain under the sink and flooded the bathrooms. There was only 1 room that they would change and changed again and again and still flooded. The hotel was not very helpful with problems. The beds were comfortable and clean.There is not lift/elevator so be prepared to walk up 4 flights of steps to the second floor.There was a roof lounge and we did use it well into the night.The hotel wanted payment the same day we checked in. They then insisted we pool our money for all the rooms and pay at one time since they had no change to give us they said.We tried to change money at the front desk and they refused.Even the bank next door refused to change money. Thank heaven for Thomas Cook across the street.The worst part was their so called security guard. We were kept getting a bad feeling about him. One of the single room (lady) returned to her room to freshen up and he followed her into her corner room. She stopped him dead in his tracks and went face to face with him asking what the bleep he wanted. Complaining to the front desk was worthless. They just said he is security.I would not stay here again since there were many choices in the area. The area was nice for shopping. The hotel did have internet for 60INR (30 minutes). The straw that broke the camels back was at breakfast. The ladies ate early for 150INR however when the gentleman came down to eat (the same breakfast exactly) their bill was 91INR.We noted this to the front desk and they said he ordered less items. Not true. Thank goodness it was only 1 night. We would have relocated if it was more. "
hotel jukaso down town ,"Don't stay here!! OK, it looked nicer on the pics I've seen on the hotel website. And yes, I admit that this hotel is the best locationwise as it's in the center of Connaught place. However, when I first stepped in the hotel, the smell instantly made me sick. When I got there, my room was not ready, but they let me have a look at the room anyway. Whoever stayed before me, that person is absolutely disgusting. Cigarette butts were all over the floor, and the bed sheets were stained... and the bathroom!?? OMG, I don't even want to talk about it. (refer to the pics I posted.)They made me wait outside until they finish cleaning, and guess what!? It took less than 5 minutes to clean that messy room. They didn't change the sheets.. ahhh...Be aware of the travel agency they'd introduce to you. They charged me Rs.2,200 for the bus trip to Agra, but it turns out everyone else on the bus paid Rs.550 or less. They said it would be a new, large, and air-conditioned bus and most tourinsts would be from European countries. Oh, well.. I was the only non-Indian on the bus, and it surely sucked. Do not stay at this hotel. You don't want to waste ~$70/night for this crap. I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand before this hotel. You can get good deals from Asianrooms.com , so try. This hotel is not the best Intercontinental.. but since it's really hard to find decent hotels in Delhi, i think this hotel is really nice. "
hotel jukaso down town ,"decent hotel in connaught place a few points:1) this is NOT 'Jukaso Inn', it is 'Hotel Jukaso Inn' - these are 2 different hotels - yes it is confusing!!2) i gave this hotel 4/5 (&quot;above average&quot;) as for delhi it is above average. i would probably give it 3.5/5 if i couldok, basically delhi is really hard to get a decent hotel that isn't ridiculously expensive. well this is an exception. it is a decent hotel in a very handy place, connaught place. it isn't beautiful but it is decent and clean with a good size room, bed, tv and shower/bathroom. the A/C was so-so as you couldn't choose a personal setting, it was basically a grill in the wall with cool air coming in. but the room was nice and cool so i didn't mind. there was a fan that could be controlled too.the breakfast was pretty good i thought though my girlfriend didn't like her eggs (no problem, i ate hers too!). it had 1 computer for internet use and at 68Rs (why 68?!!) per hour wasn't very cheap. other than that this hotel was grand. they were helpful with storing our bags all day as we had a late flight. and they helped organise a taxi for us.so in short, booking hotels in delhi is a nightmare cos all the reviews seem to be so bad, or else they are ridiculously expensive. well if i was ever staying in delhi again i'd stay here, and i would recommend it to a friend. "
hotel lal s haveli ,"ok clean and friendly staff Although the sorrounding is a bit low standard and the hotel from outside could be more friendly we found the rooms very clean and comfortabel. The staff was friendly. We had problems to find the place as the location on google maps was wrong, but that should be corrected in the meantime. Reception guys were very helpful. Room 303 is sometimes very loud as the Kitchen of the rooftop restaurant is right above it, otherwise the area was quiet during nighttime.All in all pretty good hotel for that price. "
hotel lal s haveli ,"No Business Sources here I can’t use my laptop here, no internet access , my client wanted to visit me but can’t find this hotel, the telephone operator was bad and rude with him while helping him with the directions. A backpacker area. "
hotel lal s haveli ,Good value for the money We chose this hotel for our over-night stay in Delhi. The place is good value for the money. It definitely needs a little polish here and there... but our bathroom was spotless!The staff was very friendly and did their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Moreover we can recommend their restaurant. 
hotel lal s haveli ,"A very good hotel in Paharganj We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our trip around India. The area of Paharganj is not the most touristy of areas and a pretty rundown however it gives you quite a good india experience as this is what a lot of India is like. People remain kind and if you can put up with the staring of the locals then its cheap and close to the train station.The hotel is down a bustlig side street. It is clean and the rooms are well apointed, nice double bed, TV and clean bathroom. AC and room fan available. Good selection of room service and upstairs restaurant is clean and has lovely views over the busy area. I did not find any cockroaches - always reassuring!The staff are extremely freindly. Happy to help sort things out and are always on hand for assistance. I cant speak Hindi and so there were some communication difficulties but nothing big. The brother of the owner offered some tourist travelling deals but we had already organised ours prior to coming. He was not pushy and offerred help if anything else we needed.One downside is that they do provide a pick up service, even though extremely useful is more expensive than the taxis you can pick up at the airport. The other being if you want to get a rickshaw from the train station to here and you are not Indian/look touristy in what should cost 10-20 rupees they will try and charge 100-150 rupees. We ended up getting quite angry with them and walking at 11pm(only a 10 minute walk though but not the safest area to walk in when dark - a risky venture)In summary - if you are up for the challenge of staying in Paharganj (cheap accomodation, authentic Indian experience and proximity to train station) then I would recommend this hotel to you. Clean and friendly "
hotel lal s haveli ,"Finding an Oasis in Delhi I stayed at Lals Haveli for one week in September 2009 at the end of a 15 month trip around the world. I booked through hostelworld.com. When I first saw the outside I wondered if I had been droped off at the correct hotel, but when I went inside I was met by very friendly and welcoming staff. The room was not the biggest I had stayed in but was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything I was promised. They provided room service which was very nice. The food was traditional Indian food, not westernised, but excelent quality. The hotel is located just off a main road down a bussling side street, about 500M from New Delhi Railway station and about 1 Mile from Connaught Place and the nearest subway sation. The room I stayed in was very quiet and the other guests were respectfull and quiet at night. "

hotel lal s haveli ,"Good value for money but you can find better Good location -right near pahar ganj, so very busy and dirty area. Fab sweet shop just outside.

The staff was plentiful and courteous. The room was large and very clean. My only problem is that Delhi is cold at this time, but when I requested a second blanket it came think and fast. The room service was reasonable and fast. The location was very good to check out the center of Delhi. I was a first time visitor to India traveling as a woman alone and this Hotel made me feel very comfortable. "
hotel lal s haveli ,"Somewhat dirty room spotless bathroom good staff I spent a few days in and around the Paharganj area in New Delhi, where this hotel is located. It's unfortunately not on the main bazaar itself, but rather north a few blocks (it was about 15 mins walk from the New Delhi train station), so it's a bit difficult getting back there, especially since most rickshaw drivers hadn't heard of it or know where it was. All in all, the hotel wasn't so bad, it was in a lot of ways a welcome respite from the hell that is Paharganj (to any traveller going to India for the first time, I highly HIGHLY advise against staying in the Paharganj area during your first stay, it is quite frankly chaotic hell, stay somewhere like connaught place, which is more relaxed, there are tons of rickshaws available anywhere in the city anytime of day that will get you to the old city and main bazaar for around 50 Rupees ~ $1.50). The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, they even let me keep my luggage there free for a week as I left and travelled west into Rajhastan. One thing you'll soon learn about India is that the hotel staff tend to sleep in the hotel itself on the floors in the lobby, so if you have a 6 am train departure like I did, don't feel bad to wake them up, the staff here were friendly even then. The room itself was fairly well furnished. I paid about 750 rupees a night (~$20) for a single room, it had a TV and bathroom with western toilets and a shower that gave warm but not hot water (which is still a plus in India, considering 3/5 hotels I stayed at had only cold water). The bathroom itself was truly spotless, which was the biggest saving grace of this hotel (otherwise I would give it a 1/5). The room itself was clean, but the sheets and pillow covers weren't quite washed, and frankly I killed 4 cockroaches while I was there, which should put things into perspective. The room was also a bit musty and lacked a proper window.There were two other great things about this hotel. First, there was an internet cafe right behind it for 20 rupees/hour. Second, almost right across from it was an awesome sweets shop called Bikaner Sweets (very very clean and western in setup), and upstairs of the sweet shop was a great vegetarian family restaurant, also very clean and cheap (highly recommended).All in all, the good sides of this hotel are balanced with its bad sides. The location isn't so great, and the room is somewhat dirty, but the staff are friendly, the bathroom was clean, and the internet cafe and nearby restaurant were the bomb. If it wasn't for the cockroaches and dirty bedsheets, I'd give it a 4/5. "
hotel legend international ,"Service was Crap!! My spouse and I arrived at the Hotel Legend around 9pm after a long flight. Our bags had not arrived, so we were tired and all we could thing of was a hot shower and food. Upon arrival at the hotel we received a very cold welcome at the reception. We were told if we want food to call the kitchen, however upon calling to place an order we were told they didnt have any food. The staff ordered food for us from outside and charged us 3 times the price. When it came time for a shower, one EACH night we had to request the staff to turn on the hot water so we could have a hot shower. We also had to tell the staff to turn on the AC in our room (very frustrating!). Our bed sheets had to be changed twice because they were blood stained and it seemed like the sheets were never changed from the previous occupants.Yuck!! I know this is a budget hotel, but these simple services should at least be mandatory in a hotel thats boasts about 24hr hot water/AC and a simple smile would go a long way. "
hotel legend international ,"Budget hotel nothing more Given I've travelled to India previously and stayed in some very cheap, but great accommodation, I was happy to book Hotel Legend as the reviews were good, despite it being super cheap ($39 AUD per night). However, compared to other properties we stayed in during this recent trip, I'd have to say that I don't agree with many of the reviews currently listed for Hotel Legend. My husband and I found it to be a budget property with not much else to offer....the room definitely didn't look as nice as those in the pictures, the only sheet on the bed was quite stained and I had to ask for a top sheet to use with the questionably clean blanket. We did have hot water, but the toilet didn't flush, which wasn't a huge surprise. Staff were OK, location was always going to be busy given it's close to the train station and essentially in the heart of backpacker district, but all in all, I don't feel Hotel Legend deserves the average &quot;very good&quot; rating that it's been given. "
hotel legend international ,"Looks impressive on the website but pretty average hotel Hotel Legend International looked impressive on their website but was a fairly average hotel. The location was fine - walking distance to restaurants but a lengthy rickshaw ride to Chandi Chowk, fort etc. Lots of staff at the hotel that seemed to just sit around and argue but not do a whole lot of work. The rooms were fine - clean &amp; comfortable, usual wet bathroom but the toilets didn't really flush (nor was there always hot water). The rooms were noisy - there was a telephone that rang continuously on our floor, all through the night and was never answered or turned down. The restaurant food was awful - old rice that looked like it was half rice/half grubs, tasteless curries, bad chai (with rice in it) and bad service - only one menu for the entire restaurant, when we were taking too long (all of a few minutes) looking at it, the hotel staff whipped it out of our hands and gave it to someone else. For 1500 INR per night, I think you could probably find a better value hotel in Delhi. "
hotel legend international ,"Good value for money good location I stayed here on three occasions during the summer with my girlfriend and members of my extended family who were in India for a wedding. It's in a great central location right next to New Delhi train station which is helpful for internal travel. The Metro also stops here so it's good for getting around the city. Some of my lesser-travelled family members found the area a bit rough and ready but we found it safe enough once you take the usual precautions. It's only a 5 minute stroll to the Main Bazaar in Pahar Ganj and about a 10-15 minute walk to Connaught Place. The communication from management before our arrival was good and they were helpful overall. Rooms are clean with big comfortable beds. Some rooms have fridges and others don't. They are not very roomy as other reviews here have mentioned but as we spent the majority of our time out and about exploring Delhi, we found them perfectly adequate. The A/C worked well in any room we stayed in. Staff are very (too) attentive at times and are plentiful. One thing that we would have liked was a restaurant or lounge of some sort as we had to eat in our room all the time if we stayed in the hotel. They were talking of opening a roof-top restaurant when we were leaving which would be a good addition. There wasn't too much noise from outside but this depends on where your room is located also. There were staff telephones, which were located on the half-landing, ringing from early morning which was a bit irritating but the volume can be turned down. This is worst when you stay in any of the rooms ending in -01, -02, -03. I brought it up with the management and they said they would try to rectify matters so hopefully it might be sorted for future guests.The only real negative aspect of our stay was the behaviour of the Travel Agent in the lobby. He was very pushy, unpleasant to deal with and over-charged members of our group a significant amount on a few occasions. The service he provided was also sub-standard when we travelled in a car organised by him to Jaipur. (We left an hour late, were charged more than others in the same car, were dumped out a few miles from the city centre in Jaipur and had to pay to get another TukTuk into town). There is no shortage of travel guys in Delhi so shop around! Apart from this we found out stay at the hotel to be positive overall. Very good value for money, clean, central and comfortable. "
hotel legend international ,"funky design in an amazing neighbourhood eat on the roof Our first night in India, arriving at 4am after a bus crew couldnt locate hotel. (TIP Print off own map of your hotels) Friendly staff ,especially on the rooftop resturant, very pleasant rooms and great location and value. Its not luxury but clean, and some of our group found the area a bit intimidating. It is a vibrant hectic place with a tourist road right amoungst the locals. Everybody we met smiled and wanted to talk with transport around very easy. We had great meals up on the roof with the staff so accomodating and enjoyable. A briiliant start to our visit to India. "
hotel legend international ,"great service strange location... If you are willing to be a taxi-ride away from the action, this hotel was really quite good! They had a large service staff who were welcoming and smiling at every opportunity (maybe this was because we were a large group, or that we were nice and appreciative towards everything they did for us). I had a single? room on the ground floor, right next to the computers and travel desk. The room was quite large and even had a double-sized bed. The bathroom was great, too, but as with everywhere in India (so far) teh bathrooms tend to get hot during the day so remember to close it as you leave!! There are two computers available for free internet access, one wasn't working when I was there and they actually let me use theirs in their little office! There'sa lift, which is always a bonus, and a rooftop restaurant. The food was wonderful for any meal of the day, and none of the 18 of us got sick! One night we had bought too many beers and shared some with some of the service guys- they thought we were fantastic! If I could give any negatives they would be that you aren't really close too much, and that it was really tricky to find initially. It was also pretty noisy with street noises, but earplugs are a fantastic invention!! "
hotel legend international ,"Good value for money ( 20£) and good location Stayed there for two nights Aug.2009. Excellent location--close to New Delhi Train Station ( NOT NIZMUDDIN AS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT) and Connaught Place.The hotel lobby was inviting and clean, and the room we had was clean, although small. ( Made smaller by furniture that was too large for the room) The bathroom was large and clean--bring your own shampoo. Towels were small, but I asked for some bigger ones, the sheets on the bed were stained, so I asked for,and recieved clean sheets. Breakfast is included but is NOT buffet style..you order it from the menu and eat in your room.That struck me as kind of weird..but was fine. Be careful though, the servers simply knocked THEN WALKED IN...to prevent this, always lock your door. The room was cheap--20£ per night--and overall a really good budget hotel. DOWNSIDES--there were always many loiterers in the lobby and on the stairs....I didnt understand that. Also, there were loiterers in hte halls,outside our room...ready for our beck and call. Tipping is appreciated--and can go a long way to better service!Overall...a 8/10 for a budget hotel "
hotel legend international ,"Fantastic Value for money I booked the hotel from england, before travelling to delhi, as all previous reviews had been pretty positive. I was not bothered about the location, as I was only stopping in Delhi for the one night before going to Punjb next day. There were 9 of us in total (3 families including kids). We were picked up from the airport (taxi driver waited even though we were about 2 hours late), taken to the hotel,check in was quick, and I was really impressed with the rooms. I booked two trible bed rooms, which has one super kink bed and a single bed. Rooms were very clean, and were ensuite. For the price, no one can complain, we ordered food at around 2 am, and although they had to go outside to get it, but was really good. The whole stay cost me around £100, that includes airport pickup, and drop off at the railway station. I liked it that much that before I flew back to england, i stopped there again. Really recommend this hotel to anyone who is unsure about budget accommodation in delhi, as i was before I booked. "
hotel legend international ,"In such a busy city this hotel was just what we needed Although the rooms were quite small, they are no smaller than those in hotels in other cities elsewherein the world.Delhi is such a crazy place, that after a busy day walking, the room was much appreciated. The rooms were very clean. The staff were very helpful. I would recommend this hotel. "
hotel legend international ,Good i stayed in the property for 7 days and the stay and service was good 
hotel legend international ,"Good location but not value for money For us, the location was great as it was a five minute walk to the new dehli train station, but the hotel room was dark, air con didn't work and constant noise throughout the day and night . . and no hot water! 'Very hard sale' by the in-hous travel agent was annoying and worth avoiding at all costs.For what we paid, it really wasn't value for money. "
hotel legend international ,"Good Value near New Delhi train station This hotel was comfortable and very easy on my budget. It is located a short walk from the New Delhi train station and Metro stop. The street it is located on is somewhat lively so you may hear some noise but I was not disturbed by it. The online booking process was easy and accurate. I opted for the airport pickup through the hotel, the driver was on time and friendly. "
hotel legend international ,"Probably not the Best Hotel in the Area. Probably. There's nothing really wrong with this place - the staff are ok, the room was acceptable and the bathroom, although prone to get absolutely soaked when using the shower (remove all clothing and toilet roll before using), is fine. That said, we struggled with the hot water and the place is very, very noisy at night. We did arrange for the hotel to pick us up from the airport which they confirmed (twice) but then didn't do as they wrote down the wrong date. This was a good thing though - we got a prepaid taxi for R350 while the hotel was charging R600. They made up for it by giving us free toilet paper when we left, though be aware if you buy bottled water from them they seem to make up the price each time - it can cost anything from R15 to R25. It's a great location for a number of things - New Delhi train station is 5 mins walk away, and they have an excellent facility for travellers to book train tickets - go to the 1st floor and follow the signs and do not listen to ANYONE who tells you otherwise. You're also 3mins by rickshaw from Connaught Place and not much further from chaotic Old Delhi. When you arrive a walk down the nearby Old Bazarr should get you into the spirit of things.The hotel gives home to a rather sleazy looking fellow who will, almost as soon as you get in, try to sell you all sorts of tours, viewing experiences, train tickets and assorted malarky. It's rather frustrating when you want to just check in and take a shower, even more frustrating when he badgers you every morning, noon and night - I believe he actually lives on the sofa by his desk. Take him with a pinch of salt, laugh at his outrageously inflated / fluctuating prices, and then ignore him - he's harmless. "
hotel legend international ,Uneasy ambience and pushy travel agent We booked here after reviews on this site seemed good but only stayed here for a quick nap as we arrived 11 hours late at 10am the next morning. We rang and told them to pick us at the domestic terminal but the driver didn't show up - we rang him but he couldn't find us (but couldn't tell us where he was?) and told us to get a taxi ourselves. When we arrived at the hotel the travel agent tried to charge us Rs650 for the non-existent pickup - after some arguing on two occasions we didn't pay him. The room was clean enough but there was no hot water and the toilet didn't flush - it just sprayed water from it's pipework across the bathroom floor. The main concern was the number of people loitering on the stairwells and in the lobby which didn't make us feel all that secure here so was glad we only stayed for a very short time before catching a train. The good thing about the hotel is it is only a 5 minute walk to New Delhi train station - can't think of much else though! 
hotel legend international ,"nice retreat in busy delhi We enjoyed a 5 day stay at this hotel.We were able to negociate a slightly cheaper price on arrival which is worth doing, approximately 1400 rupees.They arranged pick up from another hotel near the airport.The man organising trips/travel at the front was a bit pushy but otherwise the staff were ok, not overly friendly but not rude.We ordered room service a few times whcih was really nice.The room itself was very comfortable and spacious, air con and bathroom were good.Would happily stay again.Also free internet in the lobby. "
hotel legend international ,"Good News- Bad News We chose Hotel legend among other similar &quot;budget&quot; properties in the neighborhood partly based on the comments by the manager here in these reviews. The rooms were pretty much as expected although ours had no windows, and service was acceptable. We had some items stolen from our luggage there, which included a small amount of cash, I miss the money clip more than the dollars. Part of the problem is that everyone in the lobby knows your plans. The 'travel agent' is a loud-mouth, and all employees knew our travel plans for the day which gave almost everyone within earshot the opportunity to know when we were away. There seems to be a number of 'employees' lingering about with nothing to do, and we got a feeling of unease about them watching us. Since we can't prove anything, we can only say, use an extra amount of caution at The Legend.The 'complimentary' breakfast was as expected and sufficient. However, unless you eat in your room, the other option is on the rooftop which has the atmosphere of an industrial air conditioner. The tables are located under a green piece of plexiglass which gives your eggs and toast a nice, greenish tint. The internet only worked half of the time. "
hotel legend international ,"Great location clean good value This was my first experience of a hotel in India, the first stop in a three week trip. Of the horror stories I had read about hotels I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel was as advertised..the price as quoted, it indeed had hot water as I was to discover many places said they did but actually didn't, it was reasonably clean and it even had toilet paper..!! The staff were friendly, we were able to use the Internet in the lobby whenever we wanted. I would say it was good value for the money. Also I arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport and it was there..!! So overall we were quite pleased. "
hotel legend international ,"Nothing special but it does the job This hotel could be freshened up a bit as the pictures look much nicer than what you actually get, it is really noisy (both the city and the staff are extremely noisy) and it feels a bit overpriced. Besides this, and considering it'd Delhi, the rooms are big and relatively clean. It's also 5 minutes away from the train station, so the location is great, especially if you're getting an early flight. "
hotel legend international ,"A Decent Place to Stay I chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and was pleased with my decision. The rooms are pretty basic and the towels could definitely stand to be replaced, but the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have TV in the room. The travel guy in the lobby is definitely shady and will change his quoted price every time you talk with him. However, if you do bring up a price that you got at some other travel agency, he'll definitely move on his prices. Breakfast is okay, but dinner is fantastic. Personally, I didn't find the hotel to be particularly noisy, but they did seem to be doing construction somewhere in the hotel as there was a constant pounding during the day up until about 9pm. I just chalked it up to it being India and didn't let it bother me. Paharganj is definitely not the nicest place in Delhi but it is close to the railway station, which, when you're catching a 6am train is exactly where you want to be. Overall, I'm happy with my stay. "
hotel legend international ,"Good location if you want to see Phaharganj The Paharganj market district is one of Indias must see attractions, that was my main reason for staying here. However the Hotel is satisfactory in every way, clean rooms and good service. A good budget hotel. "
hotel legend international ,"Great clean hotel good value for money! We always make it a point to head straight for this hotel whenever we are in New Delhi. It's so close to the charming shops of Paharganj, all the services are nearby, the rail station is so close and Connaught Place is just a short rickshaw ride away. When we first stayed here in 2007, the security guard used to come and take our toddler from the vehicle to the door! I love the left luggage facility, it means that we can use New Delhi as a base and not haul our 6 suitcases all over India! It can be a bit noisy with all the room service buzzers going off but it's clean, inexpensive, and the service is great. We'd recommend this hotel to anyone! "
hotel legend international ,"terrible- bad location The hotel is located in one of the worse locations in New Delhi! There was no hot water, limited amounts of toilet paper, the TV channels kept going and the noise from outside was so bad that even ear plugs could not block it out. I would not recommend the breakfast, also the guy who sells the tours was very shady, kept changing prices????I would not recommend this hotel as its not in a safe location and your bound to get ripped of! "
hotel legend international ,"Patience is needed - especially if you don't have any laundry Looking back our stay here was so comically and surreal.Very nice location close to the train station, but it is also a very noicy street, The staff english was quite limited, and even upon arrival we were asked if we had any laundry. Since we were going home in two dayes the answer was no.The rooms are quite smallish, but comfortable enough. However the walls are extremly thin, and you can hear every word being said in the hall. We even had a bellboy stationed outside our room, and even thought he didn't understand a word of danish, privacy was limited.Every time we went outside our room, we were asked if we had any laundry, and imagine their dissapointment when my tailormade dress arrived at the hotel, and they thought we had our laundry done elsewhere. I actually had to show them my dress, to make them understand.Roomservice came to the immidiatly (after all, he sat just outside) but they usually forced their way into the room, which was quite annoying.I would recoomend this hotel, after all, we ended up having a blast, and some very strange and funny memories of this hotel ;o) "
hotel legend international ,"good value for money Stayed at the hotel in the first week of March with my wife and 3 yr old daughter. Good clean rooms, with decent food, average hospitality. Happy with their luggage storage facility, when we twice left the hotel for different tours. Did not use the tour operator in the hotel lobby for the 1st tour (based on previous reviews on this website!). The tour operator was distraught and immediately gave me a very good rate for the 2nd tour, as well as the return trip to the airport (better than the tour operator across the road). "
hotel legend international ,"Terrible service poor location We booked to stay at the hotel legend for 3 nights in february. We informed the hotel via email that we would be arriving late at night and they agreed to meet us at the airport. When we arrived in delhi, no-one from the hotel was at the airport and we could not get through on the phone.We eventually got a taxi and when we arrived at 2am there was a group of men sitting in reception. We were told that the hotel was full and when we said we had a booking they got another gentleman who just said they were full and to come back tomorrow with no apology or explanation as too why our booking had fallen through. By this time we were exhausted and the road the hotel was on looked very dodgy so luckily our taxi driver found us a much nicer hotel in another area. We will definetly not be coming back. "
hotel legend international ,"Good hotel in great location A good clean and safe hotel in a fantastic part of Delhi. Very close to the railway station and only a 5 minute auto ride from Connaught Place. The staff were helpful although sometimes pestered a little and although there is no restaurant as such the food is very good - we used the roof terrace several times to eat. The rooms are clean and spacious with comfortable beds, tv and some have a fridge.Look out for a wonderful staff member called Ramu - a very lovely and helpful chap - tip him well :)I would certainly stay here again and would definitely recommend it to anyone. "
hotel legend international ,"Safe clean comfortable hotel in Paharganj. As other reviewers I liked Legend and stayed a total of 8 nights. I would also recommend it to others. Compared to others in this price range (1200-1500 Rs) the rooms are well furnished (very good mattresses), clean and safe (sturdy doors with good locks).Room service is efficient, free internet in lobby, staff are friendly and the food is good and tasty (rooftop seating available).As per other reviewers I would warn against using the travel agent who is seated in the lobby 24 hours! His services are all overpriced and he hassled me continuously whenever I was in the lobby area. You need to fight him off! To book train tickets there is a good place across the road which only charges 75 Rs commission.Overall this place really feels like home-from-home and is warmly recommended. "
hotel legend international ,"comforts of home in Delhi For our first few nights in intimidating India we booked with the Legend Hotel, and we were glad we did. It's a little higher than our usual budget, but having a comfortable place to get over jet lag was worth it. The street is still pretty busy but the interior of the hotel was very nice. Everything is very new. We had a great bed, good TV, and mostly hot water. Room service was good and pretty cheap as well. I'd highly recommend this hotel while you're getting used to the chaos here, or simply to anybody who enjoys having a larger room. "
hotel legend international ,"Good value for the price My first night I stayed at Ajanta hotel and was quite dissatisfied because for 3000 rs you can find better place in that area. The international legend is a good choice because:1. I paid about 1000 rs for room with TV and 1400 for room with LCD TV. 2. Internet is free.3. The hotel was almost empty, when others were full.4. The cleaning is very good. After cleaning the room smells good.5. I liked the doors. The rest of the hotels in that area have doors that looked really bad.Minuses:1. Tiped waiter 20 rs and then every morning he knocked the door at 8am trying to clean something or do something for me. Really annoying. Especially if you usually get up at 10.2. i do not know why people say that location is good. it is true that hotel is very close to railway station but the area looks like Berlin after WWII. Many people, very dirty streets.3. Do not buy tours from travel agency in the hotel. They are really overpriced and guy who sells these tour is not nice at all.4.Hot water is woring only in the morning time. At the evening you have to bakshesh waiters to turn on boiler.Anyway, place is good value choice. "
hotel legend international ,"good location average value booked the hotel through email. rate of 2250rs incl tax and breakfast for a super deluxe. the room itself dont quite feel like super deluxe. the window was tiny and gave no view at all. i specifically asked what difference there existed between a deluxe and a super deluxe and the hotel replied that the super deluxe provided a fridge, a TV and more space. well... to the contrary as advertised the fridge seemed non-functioning for quite some time. it wasnt switched on at all. and the room didnt feel very spacious. the TV was the only thing that worked as promised and was a 26inch sony LCD.on the plus side, the room was rather clean (with the exception that there were a couple of cockroaches that got killed as soon as sighted) and bed was comfy. breakfast was cooked to standard. but to have hot shower (24h as advertised), i actually needed to phone frontdesk so that some ppl got the heater switched on (centrally controlled). when i first called at 10pm (after whole day of sightseeing) the frontdesk person told me to have hot shower next morning! only when i clearly told them that was unacceptable did they switch it on. and a further 20mins wait before hot water was available.the location itself is quite good. being 5 min walk from new delhi train station in PG. and internet that worked was provided free - which is always a plus esp when it was at a time around the mumbai terror attack.never get talked into deal by the hotel travel agency ppl - they overcharge. for a taxi trip to qutb minar and then to airport, the man quoted us 800rs and refused to negotiate. we went out, and greeted by a driver and got it 500rs without much negotiation. the frontdesk ppl were decent in providing price index though, and didnt try talk you into some deal of theirs.a B&amp;B south of CP may offer better hospitality and personality. but they typically charged in the range of 3500rs upwards. so given this comparison, i give this hotel a 3 star rating, mainly for its location and average price/performance ratio. "
hotel legend international ,"Pretty good hotel This was quite a nice hotel in a good location. We stayed there twice in a three week period. The room was pretty clean and the staff were very helpful - there was always someone available to help out. We had a couple of small issues - there weren't any sheets on the bed, only a blanket (not uncommon in India though - I'd recommend carrying a sheet/sleeping bag liner) and on both visits we had to ask for the air con and the hot water to be switched on. On the whole though, a pretty good place for the price. "
hotel legend international ,"Perfect Stay!! We stayed at this hotel from 23rd October for 2 nights and I have to say it was an oasis of calm in mad Delhi!!We originally were to stay in the Rama Deluxe but one look at the bathroom and I demanded to move to the Legend after reading about it on Trip Advisor.The hotel is very clean, the staff are very polite and nothing is too much trouble. the main point is that it is quiet, despite being in the middle of Delhi! The bedsheets were a little worn but this was not really a major problem, we also had to wait for 5 minutes for the water to heat up in the shower but this is a problem all over India.We also tried the breakfast, and was very pleased with that too.If you are looking for a reasonably priced, clean hotel for a few nights in Delhi then this is the perfect place. Frankly, this hotel deserves a better ranking on Tripadvisor that 31, it should be in the top 10! Well done Hotel Legend International. "
hotel legend international ,"Wonderful I and my wife stayed at Hotel Legend, New Delhi for 3 nights in September.The room given to us was on 3rd floor. It was a nice, big room with good furniture. The room was clean and comfy.The Interiors of the hotel is real good(specially their 1st floor lobby) and service is also good.I would highly recommend this hotel for all.Only 1 problem they have internet in the lobby, no Wifi net. "
hotel legend international ,"Good hotel Clean and resonable price. I've been to Delhi many times for bussiness. The hotel price in Delhi is very expensive according to their level. I found this hotel by tripadvisor and tried, it's a surprise to have such a good hotel at this price. It's clean, with big room. The service is very good. The only problem is Wifi, there is no wifi, I have to go to the lobby to use Internet.Linong Guo from China "

hotel le roi ,"Comfortable Hotel in New Delhi This is my first time to New Delhi. Before coming to Delhi I was looking several 3 stars hotel through internet and got some places that can give enjoy time during stay in Delhi. Gotcha.. I decided one hotel named Le Roi Hotel and check in the hotel that very clean, and nice service from the front office until the room boy. Although it located in the crowded area but it very closed to the Metro station that can connected to Rajiv Chock..the central of India in the next station. A lot of restaurant and money changer surrounding the hotel, but if you wanna eat in the restaurant of hotel...its also really delicious food that made by the cooker in the hotel and the price was reasonable price. The other one that make me feel at home when the GM and GRO explained me about Delhi... they are very warm and give me opportunity to kept my bagage and browsing free internet until midnight before check out at midnight. Thank you Le Roi Hotel, if someday I am coming to Delhi...absolutely I would like to stay there. "
hotel le roi ,"Very nice hotel kind stuff We visited hotel Le Roi with friends in november 2009, we felt very nice and comfortable, stuff were very kind and helpful, we enjoyed our staying very much. I can recommend this hotel to every one who stays in Delhi. "
hotel le roi ,"Great stay!!!! We stayed in Le Roi late October 2009 and had a fantastic stay. It is a new hotel. It is very clean and spacious the room does have little greatness (the air con was very quiet) and all in all it is a very good apartment. As far as the room is concerned, it is luxurious room, if you want a clean place to store your clothes, rest your head, and get ready for a working day or night out, then it does the job more than adequately. What gives the hotel such great review is the service you receive. I can quite honestly say I have never received such excellent service before. The staff was all extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for us. When we felt a bit poorly one evening they suggested we have some feni (the local spirit) to settle our stomachs. I must admit, I was apprehensive, and as strong as it was, it did the trick! All the staff say hello, everyone makes you feel welcome, and everyone always has a smile on their face. I definitely know people will go back there year after year for sure we will!!!! We went for a relaxing 10 days break and we certainly got it, mostly thanks to the fantastic service we received in Le Roi. "

hotel le roi ,"Very good perfect location friendly staff Le Roi is a brandnew hotel (sept 2009) in the middle of the crowded noisy touristic Paharganj area. It is an oasis! The best hotel in this area. It is quiet, modern, has the best soft beds we have had in India and a perfect warm shower. The rooms are very very good. And it is not too expensive, good value for money! Since it is a new hotel, not everything is perfect yet. The swimmingpool is not ready yet, parts of the hotel are stil under constuction and the staff is sometimes a little bit clumsy. (toiletpaper was removed several times, they forgot to clean the room, the key was blocked every day, breakfast buffet was almost empty). No problem for us, but we hope for future visitors that they improve these things the next months. If they do, this hotel will become very very popular! "
hotel le roi ,"Great hotel great price great service Found Hotel Le Roi on TripAdvisor and am very thankful, so I shall share my thoughts and experience.Stopping in for the night, I came in late on an international flight and driving towards the place I instantly started to think I may have made a booking mistake because the Pahar ganj at 3am is a pretty seedy place. However Le Roi stands out like a gem, the facility is very modern and hip, all the amenities a foreign traveler could want and expect. Only problem I faced was a slight connection error from my room to the internet. However the excellent customer friendly staff worked out my internet connectivity issue &amp; has gone above and beyond to help accommodate some of my last minute travel planning. All in all, great price, great hotel &amp; exceptional service. "
hotel le roi ,"Bad Area and Average Hotel I came to this hotel on the recommendation of TRIPADVISER but on thecontrary it was not that good, the location is very crowded. The roomservice is poor as they do not listen to us for older of food. It isaverage hotel. "
hotel le roi ,"good place to go there I 've been recently to new delhi and i found this new hotel &quot; le roi &quot; it's a very good hotel , with exccelent accomodation , good services and an exquissite cusine. My standards are quit high but i was excited by the services that they offer. The prices are good and also it's located in a nice area So if you stop in New Delhi i highly recomand you to go there . "
hotel le roi ,"excellent I had an excellent stay at hotel le roi, it was a clean and nice place, rooms were comfortables and the staff helpfull and nice, everything was very good there. The hotel has a very central location. I really recommend this hotel for any stay, business or holidays.Ps : the pool will be soon finished in this hotel so if you come there you'll have it probably! "
hotel le roi ,"Newly openned Newly opened in central Pahar Ganj. Which is right by the central railway station (ask for the imperial cinema and you'll walk past Le Roi) and in the main backbacker area. Until now I'm not aware of any other &quot;decent&quot; hotels around here. Which is a shame as it's the ideal area to stay in central Delhi. The Le Roi will probably be the first of many that follow suit. The area has the everything you need and excellent access to the main attractions in the city. The hotel itself stands out for the others in the area being larger although still relatively small(it would be classed boutique size in the UK) . You enter an impressive marble entrance hall. With its bar to the left and restaurant behind. The staff are excellent and show much eagerness to assist you with any problem. The rooms see no fall in standards from the entrance and are very modern with plenty of marble and dark wood with a slight euro/oriental theme. My room was large had a new flat screen tv (I had to take the wrapper off the remote) ,safe, internet, fridge etc. The bathroom was spacious, clean and modern. Their was next to no noise despite its central location and I had no problem getting a good nights sleep. As its new some of the facilites aren't yet working fully but the management were more happy to advertise this fact before I took a room. Overall an excellent hotel in the ideal location. I'd recommend highly for anyone visiting Delhi. "
hotel lohias ,Find another place The hotel is not very clean. Staff is ok. Near airport. Dining room ok. But I would suggest finding a 3 star hotel. An Indian friend made the reservation for our departure next am. Wished he would have gone for a better place. 
hotel lohias ,"Good if you have an early morning flight This hotel is very practically situated near the airports, so if you have an early flight (domestic or international), you won't have too much trouble. In fact, they will organize a taxi to the airport for you. The rooms are quite spacious and fairly well equipped. One negative point is that it can be quite noisy at night due to the traffic on the highway just outside the hotel. "
hotel lohias ,"Great service I booked this hotel through Makemytrip. It was a nice hotel, and specially recommended for people who are travelling through airlines, because it is close to both airports(Domestic &amp; International). It is also value for money and staff was cooperative and helpful. Condition of room was excellent(neat, clean &amp; tidy). "
hotel lohias ,"Horrible hotel DO NOT STAY here I read the reviews before I booked this hotel. There were a total of 4 reviews, 2 of them mentioned filthy sheets/stains. I was not sure and I took my chances since it was so close to the Dehli airport, and it was the true reason why I chose it. The bed sheets were in fact filthy and disgusting. We checked in the hotel around 11pm that night, and left very early the next morning to catch a flight from Dehli airport, so thankfully we only had to stay in this hotel for a few hours. Regardless, I couldn't get any sleep thinking how filthy the bed was. We asked for a change of sheets, and what they brought was as filthy as what was there before. When we started taking out the old sheet to put over the new ione, the amount of disgusting stains on the matress and bed padding was simply disgusting. I do not recommend you stay here if you want a clean place. I tend not to be very picky, but this was too much. The have made an effort to put a reception desk as if it is a really fancy hotel, don't be fooled by it, the rooms are not good, and they smell. You are better off in any other hotel "
hotel lohias ,"This hotel is terrible There were blood and other unknown stains on the sheets, bugs on the floor, and neither the hot water nor the heater worked--this was an issue because it was very cold at night and the window was ajar due to the window cooling unit. After a complaint to the front desk the hot water in the bathroom sink began to work, but not in the shower so we had to use the dipping bucked to transfer water to the shower to take a ladle shower. This is a terrible hotel--you would be better off at some hostels. "
hotel lohias ,"Nearby the airport If you want a base near the airport and don’t mind sleeping in filthy sheet’s this hotel maybe will be a good choice. The hotel is pretty good located if you have an early morning flight. It’s only a few minutes with taxi to the International and National Airport. The rooms are well-sized, the beds ok, but staying their in the winter is extremely cold and draughty (no heater). Indeed it is a budget, 3-star hotel but still you expect it to be clean and tidy. The hotel is simply not well-managed!The good thing was that the staff was very friendly and helpful. "
hotel lohias ,"Good value. Great airport location. Wonderful staff. I felt the Lohias represented a good value. Adequate air conditioning, clean, hot water shower, accommodating and pleasant staff that went out of its way to help me.It's a budget hotel, so I wasn't expecting luxury, and was not disappointed.Decent restaurant, but don't expect meat w/ your breakfast!! (Same for other nearby restaurants.)The hotel is on a highway that runs along the airport, but is about an 8-minute ride from/to the terminal. Lohias is located amongst a strip of mostly budget hotels along a major road, with an intriguing neighborhood behind it through which I enjoyed strolling.Admittedly, there were problems with the hotel. The first room didn't have the hot water it was supposed to have, but staff promptly upgraded me from a Deluxe to a Suite, for no extra charge.The suite was quite spacious. I experienced a hot-water problem, but staff quickly fixed it. Great A/C and overhead fan actually made the room COLD until I adjusted it.Yes, I would absolutely stay there again if I were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near the airport. "
hotel lohias ,"Reasonably priced and convenient for the airport. The Lohias has seen better days, but in a city full of grubby and overpriced flea-pits it is a pretty good choice for an overnight if you are arriving or departing from the airport at an inconvenient hour. The room was quite big, clean by Indian standards, and there was hot water in the shower, although the &quot;inclusive breakfast&quot; was so pathetic it was barely worth eating. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming even in the middle of the night when we arrived, but beware of their pre-paid taxi fares - a taxi to Central New Delhi should only cost about 200 rupees from here. You can make a credit card reservation for it on www.travelguru.com. "
hotel madonna ,"Use as a last resort--- Some pros and some cons. No hot water. Beds and room okay, but bathroom not so clean. Three agressive bell boys insisted on helping with our two bags upon jet-lagged arrival and all wanting tips. Had trouble with AC. Breakfast adequate. Desk staff helpful. Don't stay here unless you have to. Not a good experience. "
hotel madonna ,"Excellent triporganizer! Me and my husband stayed here by a coincidence for two nights in august 2009. The hotel is situated on a good location, not far from anything if you have a driver (we had one through the hotel) or if you use the three wheelers. The staff was very helpful and friendly! We also got to know the hotel owner; mr. Naresh (Pintoo) when we wanted to book train tickets for Agra. The whole thing ended with him advising and organize a 13 day trip through Rajasthan with car, driver, hotels ,and guides in some of the cities. We got to see much more of India then we would have expected to see, which we are very grateful for. Our driver Kashmira was an excellent driver and a good and helpful friend through our journey. We would absolutely recommend this hotel and triporganizer to everyone who wants to see more of India! "
hotel madonna ,Trip was great! The hotel Madonna as well a the other tours and services offered were fantastic. I travelled with my mother who is a very nervous and picky travellor and even she liked it. The hotel is clean the staff is somewhat efficiant and they all want to make your stay as happy as possible. It is highly recommended for a comfortable and easy stay in New Dehli! 
hotel madonna ,"Perfect week good service and very friendly picp-up from the airport by an excellent driver directly to the hotel. Very good welcome in a nice hotel. Direct communication with the owner wich can tell you a lot about india. If wanted he can arrange for fixed prices day trips and you'll be treated like his guest all the way. For people that do not like to arrange to much from home you can trust this hotel to arrange reliable transport (best driver DEEPAK!), hotel stayings and sightseeing. Me and one other friend that really did not have any expectations in advance are very happy to have booked this hotel almost randomly. It turned out to be one of the best choices we could have made. We have visited india for just one short week and we have seen so much, Delhi, Jaipur and Agra really are incredible! "
hotel madonna ,"Modest rooms great staff! My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Madonna on three separate occasions while traveling between other cities in India. We really liked the night manager, Tripathi and our taxi driver, Kashmira. They were fantastic and generous and made our stay a very nice one. I must say that the hotel is a modest one and we chose it because I thought it was close to the airport, but it is at least 30 minutes away. They do offer a free pick up from the airport and free breakfast which is made to order and delivered to the room! The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff could not be nicer. They became our friends. "
hotel madonna ,"Excellent stay with affordable rates Found staff and owner, Mr Naresh, to be very helpful and really enjoyed the tour organised by the hotel to Agra and Jaipur. Will definitely recommend. "
hotel madonna ,good hotel for the money stayed for 2 nights whilst we did the taj and delhi sightseeingthe hotel arranged for our pick up at airport everything went very smoothlywe did tours thro the hotel and they were worth every penny driver was excellentonly problem not many places to eat around the hotel but we found a little veg restaurant up the road and had a superb thali for £1 hotel restaurant ........... well its not arestaurant really they fetch food in at least we can now say we have had the ultimate indian takeaway lol it seemed odd while sat waiting for your meal to see a man run in with a carrier bag food was good but a long wait whilst they fetch it from wherever all the staff were helpful especially the managerwe upgraded to a luxury room it was large and clean but not luxurious but it did the hob ti was supposed to 
hotel madonna ,"Affordable honest and friendly We had a wonderful time here thanks to Mr. Naresh who provided us excellent services, being very professional and a nice human being making us feel like at home.George &amp; Helene Lazar "
hotel madonna ,Cheap Clean and central hotel This hotel was a good clean hotel right in good location to the main attractions of Dehli. The staff were brilliant and very helpful and polite. The price was very reasonable. I would stay here again on my return to Dehli. 
hotel madonna ,"Naresh (owner) gets rave review The hotel car and driver (complimentary) was waiting for us at the airport complete with sign. Naresh also arranged the same car and driver for our tours of Delhi, and Agra over the next two days. Puri, the driver, is probably the best driver in all of India, plus he also was very knowlegeable, and professional. Puri (on his own time) at the end of a long day chauffeured us to a great restaurant.We also appreciated Naresh's friendship in offering his office and computer to us at anytime so we could try to find our missing luggage as well as track our cruise ship which could no longer come into Mumbai because of the attacks.We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful. The beds are king size, and the room was clean. We always had hot water and air conditioning.Thanks again Naresh and Puri.Teddy and Ed from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada "
hotel madonna ,"It had its ups and downs Well our stay was decent. When we arrived at the hotel they told us to go here so we got cab and arrived at the hotel. When we arrived they said were out of triples sp we will upgrade you to a suite, so we thought great,we got a suite. It turns out the room was so-so, with a refrigerator, hot showers. At night there was a lot of street noise and one mourning outside our hotel there was a parade at 6 a.m. All these things we tolerated but when we went down to ask for towels they said &quot;we'll bring them to you&quot; so they could get a tip and one guy just sat outside our door until he got one. The location is so-so and it's really near anything. They did have wi-fi (not in room), cable tv, and by the way the restraunt sucks, when we ordered they ran out and got from a different restraunt! Overall you can find a better place, us this as a last resort "
hotel madonna ,"Smashed it :-) Had a brilliant stay the hotel was comfortable and clean and provided everything we needed including a brilliant sightseeing tour of Dehli and then the key highlights of Rajasthan. The staff were the best and had a warm personnality.Again this was awesome so much so we stayed there once we returned from our Rajasthan tour. The location is spot on in the right part of town close to the sights and the conveinence of the ATM's, Banks, Shops ... thoroughly recommend this hotel when staying in Delhi. "
hotel madonna ,"Great Place to Stay We where referred to the hotel by the tourist desk on arrival in Delhi Airport. At the hotel we warmly welcomed by the staff and interacted directly with the owners. This personal touch led us to plan trips to the mountains in the North and the desert area South. We obviously use the hotel as our base stay for all the travelling done and really enjoyed coming &quot;home&quot; after the long trips away. The hotel is rmarkable in its hospitality and caring attitude of all staff and management, especially that we do not speak or understand any local languages. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Being fussy about ablution facilities we felt very at home in the neat and superb facilties. The hotel is ideally situated to travel in and around Delhi as well as a good departure point that does not get too involved in the hustle and bustle of the traffic congestions. I would definitely refer this hotel to travellers in Delhi and as a planning point for all tours. The hotel also operates a tour company with well mannered drivers who know the routes adn advise about places to visit and purchase gifts etc. I would definitely use this hotel in the future, it is also competitively priced. "
hotel madonna ,"Highly Recommended My wife and I just returned from a trip to India which started and ended at Hotel Madonna. The hotel, especially our rooms, were clean and fairly quiet, but what we liked the most about the place was the staff, who were not only helpful but genuinely friendly. The owner, Mr. Naresh Bhattia, was also able to provide advice and services for travel in his part of the country, which for us meant Agra, Jaipur and Pushkar. He set us up with a superb and resourceful driver who also turned out to be a great traveling companion and a kind of bridge to the India we otherwise might never have seen, and the hotels he booked were at least on a par with Madonna, and in the case of Pushkar, a real gem. All the foregoing at reasonable rates. So we don't hesitate to recommend Hotel Madonna and its wonderful cast of characters, starting with Mr. Bhattia, through Mr. Singh at the night desk and Protap Singh, our driver and friend. Mr. Bhattia also booked our flight from Delhi to Kerala which turned out cheaper than booking it directly from the US. "
hotel madonna ,"Loved it The Hotel was nice and clean. The services were excellent. People were very helpful, when you need something the were always there.The only thing need to be upgraded is the shower. Otherwise we were very happy to stay at this Hotel. The train is nearby the hotel and very nice to ride in. The Hotel had tour trip if you want to see other part of New Delhi. The Hotel provided us the tour pkg. which included the car and the driver to Jaipur and Agra to Taj Mahal. The Hotel on the way was excellent. We had no problem at all, everything were arranged very well. The own of the Hotel was very helpful. We didn't have to do anything even when were were in the city he gave us the car to tour the city. Tourist from Canada Nov/2008 "
hotel madonna ,"Hotel Madonna a good choice The Hotel Madonna for a mid-range Delhi hotel is in my experience a good choice, with very helpful and friendly staff.This is the second time I have stayed here. I was again picked up from the airport free of charge at 03:00 in the morning - very efficient.My previous complaint about having no wireless internet is no more, as this is now also a free-of-charge feature of the hotel. The manager even has a spare GSM card for emergency guest use, should the connection fail (which it did not do during my six day stay).Importantly the hotel is just 10 minutes walk from the metro and 5 stops from the station Rajiv Chowk/Connaught Place, which means that one can get around easily.Frank "
hotel madonna ,"Avoid We booked our stay at Hotel Madonna through Expedia, prior to consulting a print travel guide on India. The lobby is just as pictured, but the room we were given was nothing like those on the websites. The room was adequate, but definitely NOT worth the price. The surrounding area is far removed from many tourist sites, and not really an area you want to explore on foot. We asked about the complimentary internet access, but the hotel staff were unable to get their computer running Windows 95 to work--they just kept checking the cables and turning it off and on. There are much better places to stay in Delhi. Avoid the Hotel Madonna as it is overpriced and not in a desirable location. "
hotel madonna ,"Lucky to know I am a customer since last three years for the hotel madonna, the first time I visted india I was not familiar with india. I was along with my wife and were in India for her treatment purpose. i was worry how the hotel will be and how it could treat us?Realy the hotel owner Mr. Narish was a very open mind and nice person. Apart from the hotel was clean and all the people were working were so polite the owner was alwayse asking if we need his help in travel inside India and was arranging the trip outside Delhi on very comportable price.After we visited Delhi for four time, and it became for us like our own house, or house for our friend. "
hotel madonna ,"Great hospitality! We stayed in Hotel Madonna for the major part of our stay in India. In between, we made a trip to Jaipur and Agra organised by the hotel. It was a great trip, very friendly driver and very good guides!The hotel looks very good, nice clean rooms and good facilities. Breakfast at any time, and close to the metro and central places in Delhi.The owner is very friendly and really made us feel at home here, arranging whatever we wanted in no time. Thank you for the great time we had in India! "
hotel madonna ,"Loved the maddona We were warmly greeted at the airport,by hotel driver no charge.,Taken directly to hotel. Greeted by Mr.Singht at the hotel manager, asked if I wanted dinner and after a 24 hr. flight those were the words I wanted to hear. After dinner was escorted by the bellman [Sanjay] to my room which was immaculate and very clean with all western amenities including A.C. Staff was very accomodating any requests I had were fufilled,even when I left hotel I was offered a hotel business card, Staff was always concerned and wanted to make sure I always knew the way back.I had the pleasure to meet the owner Mr.Pinto who was truly a gentlemen and even sat down with me to to show the city center and directions to the popular places in town. Many Thanks to the staff at Hotel Maddona "
hotel madonna ,"Dont Book Here!!! We had contacted the hotel a few days before, that we would need to be picked up from the trainstation at 10.30pm. We had done this as we wanted to be safe and the hotel ensured us this would not be a problem!! Once we arrived and 45 minutes of waiting and on the phone the hotel told us to get any taxi and they would cover the cost. Once we finally arrived at the hotel, the manager who was very rude proceeded to argue with the taxi driver and try to get us to pay. He tried to do the same the following morning when wanting to check out. By now all we wanted to do was go to bed. When we finally got to the room it was horrible!!! Large ants all over the floor, dirty bathroom, no towels and rubbish in all the corridors. Couldnt wait to get out of there!!! "
hotel madonna ,"Excellent inexpensive clean and friendly I was coming to India on a business trip (it was my first time in India). Before the trip I started to look for the accommodation in New Delhi and discovered that the choice was basically between very expensive five star hotels and one star hostels/hotels. Nothing in between. I could not find anything that would match European 3-4 star standard and price range. Additionally, I planned to take couple of days off in India and see the country. So I needed a private tourist programme arranged by the hotel. I almost gave up on finding something for reasonable money when a colleague recommended me Hotel Madonna. I staid in Hotel Madonna and was very happy with the choice. I also sent there couple of my colleagues from Brussels who were equaly happy with the price, quality, service. We all had a very good experience with Hotel Madonna. The hotel arranged the accommodation, airport transfer (I was arriving in the middle of the night to New Delhi from Europe and the flight had a 3-hour delay, nevertheless someone was still waiting for me at the airport to bring to the hotel), the hotel also arranged my tour programme with the personal driver and a tour guide. I had most of my meals in the hotel. The accommodation was of good European 3-4 star standard. All the above was provided for very reasonable money. I would certainly recommend Hotel Madonna and will be back there again! "
hotel madonna ,not clean Just kept seeing cockroaches. 
hotel madonna ,"Unpleasant stay Rooms were dirty, staff was unfriendly. I know I shouldn't expect much but it didn't fulfill the lowest standards. "
hotel madonna ,"Hmmmm We booked this hotel not knowing much about Delhi. It turned out to be quite expensive for what we got although the location was pretty good, very noisy street, but where isn't in India. The rooms have carpet which is filthy and quite frankly carpet anywhere in India is a bad idea. Staff were friendly enough, the breakfast staff had very limited english and the breakfast was very average......I don't think I would stay here again "
hotel madonna ,loved the complimentary cookies was picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel...delightful!!Check-in was quick and easy. The owner was in thelobby..a nice gentleman. He made arrangements fora car to take us to Agra..the charge for the hire wasnot bad. The driver was very nice and helpful. Enjoyedthe complimentary cookies every evening!Would certainly visit again. 
hotel madonna ,"Great hotel in ideal location. Hotel Madonna in Delhi was very convenient to all Delhi landmarks. The hotel staff were great, literally waited on us hand and foot and arranged all our trips, which included Agra and Delhi sights. We made a comment about the great biscuits we found in our room each evening after returning and the evening prior to our departure the owner send us two boxes of biscuits each, that was six boxes for three people, i was impressed! "
hotel madonna ,"What a DUMP! Arrived in middle of night by taxi, very expensive rider, operator did not have reservation, put us up in room, dirtY, smelly, slept on top of bed as someone had already slept on sheets. Had help with luggage, but would not leave until tipped and tipped well!Bathroom was very small, you could, sh_t, shave, shower all in one position as you could not do anything else! Supplies were limited to a little toilet paper, no soap, one wet towel.Checked out early, they do not take credit cards...what we were told, only cash...I paid $60 and friend paid $100 only bills we had on hand.In very bad area.....STAY AWAY! "
hotel madonna ,"Great friends there! The staying was nice; it was a clean place. But especially, Naresh, the owner, is a greatly wonderfull friend that made our days in Delhi a safe, really nice trip. "
hotel madonna ,"Not a place to recommend The Madonna hotel was reserved for us by a travel agent, reputedly a 3* hotel. We arrived late at night (2am) and there were thankfully people awake. Two guys brought our bags up, and stayed in the room until they were tipped. I had only INR 100, but as the porter said, &quot;that is a small tip, 500 is a large tip&quot;.. Well, indeed, 100 is the most i ever tipped in India, and definitely way to much.The rooms were a bit grungy, the bathroom definitely a mess, although the shower was allright (warm water wise). The beds very very hard, and the rooms incredibly noisy. I must say i feel bad for those people trying to sleep when we arrived. Breakfast was included, but they first tried to get us to pay for the breakfast, when i pointed to the fact that it was included, they withdrew the bill. The breakfast we got was not that well, plain toast, en egg, with a lot of water it seemed.Definitely not something i would every recommend to anyone arriving in Delhi.Especially bad marks for the rude, and very tip minded staf. We had left our passports at the reception to copy, the next morning at 7:00 i was woken by the reception on the phone, that they needed our passports (we had arrived at 3 am)..... After reminder that they already had the passports, nothing more was heard. "
hotel madonna ,"no way! overpriced. trip advisor no help with Delhi no no no. boo.true: this hotel is adequate, kind of...but at 100$ a night, you're paying 3-4x what you would for similar quality in Paharganj. (!)staying here means you burn cash for a decent hotel in a pretty rotten neighborhood.Delhi is tricky -- i've stayed in 8 hotels here at the budget level, and TripAdvisor (which was invaluable in Kyoto and saved my life in Beijing) was useless. LonelyPlanet came a lot closer to helping.You can get a decent room, with some work for 30$ a night in Paharganj, which is more central than the madonna. The madonna staff wasn't particularly friendly -- and when they gave travel advice, you couldn't help feeling like they were scamming you (a pretty constant feeling in delhi, where everything is barter -- it gets old). (The madonna staff was always trying to discourage you from talking to others about your travel needs)Delhi on a budget is tricky -- but it can be done -- and location is pretty important (you won't be spending much time in your hotel room, anyway...) Noise and smell are the two things to be wary of in a delhi hotel room -- the madonna had both. a sweage smell (not as bad as some others i've stayed in) - and the constant din from the street. i've stayed in worse (though for a fifth of the cost! 20$ a night) -- and i've stayed in places where the doors are thin and you can hear the staff talking all night (oddly common experience in Delhi)But buyer beware -- just because TripAd has no reasonable options for delhi (isn't india supposed to be cheap?) doesn't mean they don't exist. Look elsewhere for the deal and the inside info. LonelyPlanet's a good bet. "
hotel madonna ,"Clean Stayed at the Hotel Madonna, ideal location to see the real Delhi. It is a clean and safe hotel by Delhi standards and the food was acceptable. The hotel is located near the the metro which is a great service, and at a very low cost, about 10 mins walk from the hotel. Regarding the hotel clean sheets and towels provided every day. Try the marsala omelette which is very tasty also the beer is chilled and very welcome after a day saying no to helpful people!!! who approach you in connaught place . Helpful staff but please have small change when you first arrive as my friend and | both got caught out , a tip of less than 100 rupees is probably more than enough for carrying your bags to the room.Noise is a major factor please bring ear plugs or you will get no sleep. Certainly not a tourist hotel. "
hotel madonna ,A decent Delhi hotel A decent Delhi hotel at a reasonable price. Clean and comfortable. Near the Metro (5-10 minute walk) so accessible to much of Delhi. In a lively neighborhood with shopping opportunities all around. Just two doors down from a fast and inexpensive internet cafe. The staff was helpful but not friendly. Also not particularly attentive: they took my passport when I arrived but failed to return it when I checked out costing me an hour (could have been worse if I hadn’t remembered). Breakfasts were good and the one dinner I had was very good. 
hotel madonna ,"New Delhi Experience Found this hotel through contact at Delhi airport and what a wonderful experience it turned out to be. The rooms were very comfortable and service excellent. We were also able to avail ourselves of the excellent service of Naresh Bhatia in organising a driver toshow us the sights of Delhi and a tour of Agra and Rajasthan for 12 days where his knowledge is second to none through his experience of booking everything including private taxi, knowledgable driver Ramesh and city guides who ensured that we ha athoroughly wonderful time. We then travelled back to Delhi and stayed at Hotel Madonna before going on to Amritsar where yet again the service provided was excellent through organisation of flights and trains including pickups to hotels etc... After this marvellous experience we returned to Madonna to conclude our stay before returning to Goa. We would definitely recommend this hotel and the services of Naresh wishing to have an excellent visit to Delhi and further afield. "
hotel madonna ,"Our Great base in Delhi At the end of June my partner and I returned from a once in a lifetime trip to India. Our first and final 2 nights were spent in Delhi were we stayed at the Hotel Madonna. As we had been warned it would be difficult to find good hotels in Delhi (not including the luxury ones), we struggled to find an option of hotels in Delhi which we felt comfortable with and within our price range. We finally settled for the Hotel Madonna, which looked okay on the web. Upon arrival, at about 2am in the morning we were warmly welcomed by the night manager and 2 people assisted with our bags. Although we booked a 'Luxury Deluxe' room and were really a bit worried about what to expect , however we were very happy with our room. It was a good size, bright, and most importantly clean. We also had airconditning, fridge and International TV channels. Also in it's favour, we found it convenient travel to all the sites we wanted to see. Staff were always friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. And after we spent 10 days travelling to other parts of India we returned and it was nice to come back to the Madonna for our last 2 days! "
hotel madonna ,"Nothing to write home about We recently stayed at this hotel for 4 seperate nights having made the reservations in advance.The hotel room itself seemed clean and bug free, although the sheets were very stained. The bathroom smelt rather musty, although again itdid look quite clean. Both toilet paper and towels were both in shortsupply, with just one handtowel supplied (on one occassion this clearly hadn't been changed as it was dirty and wet!),On the upside, the owner or manager (I didn't quite catch which) was very helpful and provided us with a map of Delhi, ran through some ofthe key attractions and directed us to the nearby subway. Other staffwere also attentive, ringing to ask if you needed any drinks bringingetc. On the downside, the constant attempts to overcharge room service etcwas very wearing and the cost of taxis booked through the hotel was extortionate (at about 5 times the cost of getting one directlly off the street without any bartering!). If you do stay here check your bills very carefully and use either the nearby subway or taxi rank at the end of the road (out of the hotel and turn left and walk straight to the end of the street) for transport. "
hotel madonna ,"Didn't like it We went in expecting the &quot;unexpected&quot; given the mixed reviews, so we brought our own sheets and towels, which came in very handy, as their sheets were dirty and our towels were much better.The hotel in general is clean, the restaurant underground does have an odor and the helpers are very nice. The location is not too bad, 4 blocks away from subway/metro station. Keep in mind that the metro/subway itself doesn't cover much of Delhi.Our experience:Upon arrival, after a 13 hour flight, the front desk guy was very welcoming, already concerned with our next-day plan's.We saw a couple of people walking in with a bottle of mineral water, and we figured we leave everything in the room and go get some of our own. On the way out, again, the receptionist asked about our plans for the next day. We walked just down the street (to the right), which has a beat up sidewalk, which is taken by some vendors anyway, and found a little tour store, which we used for just about everything. Read on for why:The next morning, again same thing, but we were firm and just said we wanted to explore by foot, which is okay, but you can't really get to many monuments by subway/metro (I don't recommend bus). At night, we decided to take a driver from the ever so concerned receptionist to go to dinner, at the Intercontinental, he charged us 400 rupees, to be paid when we checked out.Two problems there, first they way overcharged us, so we used the office listed above, and during check out they tried VERY hard to up that charge even more. So, between spending $65 per night here and $85-$90 at other places close to Connaught Place, don't bother trying to save the extra few bucks.Pictures to come... "
hotel madonna ,"A very god place to stay in Delhi A very good hotel in Delhi, with clean rooms,excellent service, friendly and helpful staff. The hotel manager, Mr. Bathia was so friendly top arrange for usn a wo9nderful trip to Agra Pushkar and Jaipur, offering us for the best price hoytels of good standards and also helping us with the transport along all my stay. i can only recomand this hotel to all who will need a stay in Delhi. "
hotel madonna ,"Cool decorations but loud with pesky staff We found this place via their website, which makes it look like a fairly hip, jazzy location. While the exterior decor is in fact cool, Hotel Madonna disappointed on many levels. Overstaffing in India is common (to provide jobs), but every time we came and went, a different guy grabbed each bag - meaning four separate tips. On one instance, I didn't have anything small to tip one of the porters (who was also in charge of delivering toilet paper), so I told him I'd tip him later; guess who ran out of TP?The location is out of the way and the neighborhood is truly India - loud all the time, with plenty of honking to keep you awake at night. Compared to the place we stayed in Bombay (thicker walls), this was like sleeping in a rock concert. The bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom was fairly grungy. They do have an internet connection, but speeds are at 1992 levels. They threw in free breakfast (mediocre) and set up some a driver for the day who repeatedly lied to us and took us to &quot;the only open restaurants&quot; in Delhi until we made him take us to one out of the guidebook that was magically open as well.Bear in mind, we stayed here after three weeks in India, so we were getting pretty sick of the tourist exploitation that goes on there. Still, you can do a lot better than the Hotel Madonna - we did everywhere else we stayed in India. "
hotel madonna ,"My first contact with India. I was in Delhi last year, my first time in India. I was a little bit afraid going alone but when I arrived at the aerport a guy from the hotel was waiting for me and brought me to the hotel, at that hour and in a strange city very pleasant. The owner, Mr. Pintoo helped me the first days, learned me more about India and what to do and NOT to do. Leaving Delhi, he helped me to reach every place I wanted to visit. The hotel is located near the metro, so very usefull to see the city. I'm going back in a few months, can't wait!Bernard "
hotel madonna ,"A wonderful place to stay in Delhi One year ago I was taled about the hotel, last year I came to Delhi and stayed in this hotle. The hotel hostility was really wonderful and I decided to come back with my wife. So this time I came with my wife and Mr. Pitoo arrange a womderful trip to Jaipur and Agra and really my wife and I enjoyed our stay. The hotle is locted colesed to the market place and suitable to go for site seeing. The evey important thing about this hotle is that it's very clean and the staff are so kind to the guests.Thank you so much for evey thing, India will be our second home after Ethiopia. "
hotel madonna ,"Not bad Delhi is a pretty hard place to get accomodations under $100 that are reasonable. Considering this, Hotel Madonna is not so bad, at $81 including taxes and breakfast. They were honest with us, and the manager (Naresh) was very good at making reasonably-priced car and travel arrangements for us. The area is also nice, as there aren't many tourists around to attract touts &amp; beggars, and there are plenty of ATMs and shops (bottled water, cell phone SIM cards, etc...). They picked us up from the airport as arranged, even though our flight was delayed by 6 hours and arrived at 4 AM.The downsides? Not the cleanest hotel we ever stayed in. Street noise can be very loud (Indian street noise is a whole different level than the west...). We had to call reception every day for towels and more toilet paper. Restaurant is best avoided. "
hotel madonna ,"Do not stay here! Everything started out OK - phoned the hotel ahead of time, got a rate in USD ($92) and arranged a hotel pick-up, which was there when I arrived. The people were nice enough, but I got the sense that they would try to deceive me. Sure enough, at check-out time, they attempted to overcharge me. Once I pointed out the mistake, they quickly rectified it.The breakfast is included, but nothing special. The dining room is subterranean and smelly. The room was clean, but very basic, and my bathroom had a direct opening to the outside and during the night when I got up to use the bathroom, there was a *bird* inside my bathroom - nearly scared the life out of me!There is a dearth of good midrange hotel rooms in Delhi. Try the India Habitat Centre if you can find someone with a membership.This hotel is not up to western standards, and should be avoided if at all possible. "
hotel madonna ,"Good value modern hotel Having read a number of reviews of Delhi hotels all had some negative aspect, be it dated rooms, moody staff, poor location or poor value. The tripadvisor reviews for this hotel seemed okay so we booked this for 4 nights via internet.Other than being an autorickshaw ride away from the centre (3-4km) and with no real restaurant alternative in the imediate vicinity we were very pleased with the hotel, the rooms were clean and well equiped with modern matching furniture, everything worked including the tv reception which was a first for India in several weeks of traveling. The hotel has a small restaurant and the food is okay and reasonably priced. Also the hotel was 500R+ cheaper than poorer sounding alternatives in Connaught Place.Overall we were happy with the hotel, the money saved more than covered the costs of autorickshaws into town. Also Karol Bagh market area, wih indian and western restaurants, is only 10 minutes walk, as is the metro station that provides a pleasant alternative to bargaining fares with rickshaw drivers and gives direct access to Red Fort, New Delhi Station and Connaught Place. "
hotel madonna ,cheap budget hotel The hotel was good but the restaurant was of poor standard every time you entered it smelt really bad; hygine was not of top of the list. However tour organiser was good and we enjoyed the tour. our room was clean but basic. If you do visit delhi be aware of profit making scandles your guide and taxi driver are usually in to make some money.We came across this when our guide would not let us go where we wanted to go and kept taking us places he wanted and forcing us to buy things that we did not want buy. 
hotel madonna ,"Very good mid-range option Service was excellent and the owner, Naresh, was very helpful. Very good in this rare mid-range category in Delhi. The location is by Karol Bagh station, which is convenient to get to various places (Old Delhi, Connaught Pl., etc.). Room was very clean, but if you can you should try and get a room in the back as there is noise on the rooms facing the street (also I was on the first floor). "
hotel madonna ,"decent mid range option There is a lack of mid-range hotels in India, there seems to be only $20-$25 hotels and $200-$250 hotels. The Madonna is a fair attempt at a mid range option. Pleasant enough rooms, free (but slooow) Internet, complementary breakfast and the possibility of walking to a metro station are all positives. The hotel is under the same ownership as one 100m away which has a Sheraton type name (but is not part of the Intl group). The staff were friendly and helpful when I was unable to print out my Expedia voucher as I had made an error entering my email address. You get the same rather hard bed that I found elsewhere around Delhi. I was there in a cold spell in early January and the room was cold, the lack of a heater, the draught from the windows and intermittent hot water in the shower meant something of a cold welcome. However heat rather than cold would be the issue for most of the year. "

hotel mehar castle ,"Not Good Stayed here for a total of three nights and didn't really have much say on where I stayed as it was booked as part of a package. I couldn't agree more with the second to last reviewer especially with regard to the moth ballsThe bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a bit of a safety hazard. The toilet had one of those &quot;sanitized for you convenience&quot; labels on it which was a joke as it was not clean. The shower curtain was filthy. The rest of the room was adequate but I didn't feel it was all that clean.Breakfast was OK.With regards to the new wing mentioned by the previous reviewer, I don't think this is being marketed as part of the Mehar as it looks from the photos in a completely different league.I would chose not to stay here in the future. "
hotel mehar castle ,"Thumbs up I was fortunate to be the very first customer of a new hotel wing associated with the Mehar Castle Hotel (same owner and overlapping management), just starting to operate as the JP Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel in mid-Nov 09 (web page yet to come). The location is just adjacent to the Mehar Castle, on a side street near Ghaffar Market of Amjal Khan Road, in Karol Bagh. I can only recommend this hotel, which is all new, with relatively generous, classy, ensuite rooms, tiled flooring and modern style furniture with latest appliances (a/c, TV, ceiling fan, fridge, safety lockers, etc…), neat bathrooms etc. It also features a small dining room for customer use and is a very quiet hotel away from street noise. I would rate the room comfort as 3.5-4 stars, with reasonable cost (Rs2,500-3,500 range inc. pick-up and breakfast). The down sides? No power point by the desk (eg. for computer), no outside windows (the price of a quiet room…) and small lobby space. Room decoration was also yet to come. The new hotel staff have been very helpful and efficient, being proud of inaugurating their small new 5 room hotel wing - the food: so far, so very good. So thumbs up from me ! "
hotel mehar castle ,"sets the bar low I'm not one to complain much, but as my first hotel in India, this really set the bar low, even though I wasn't expecting a lot. From the green slime covering the shower head, to the rot in the corners of the bathtub, to the mothballs scattered throughout the room, to the infernally noisy air conditioner...i don't know where to start. I'll start with the dead bugs i was picking out of my bed before i went to bed. And the noise that woke me up at 6am...it was daily street noise that felt like it was just on the other side of thin walls. Or maybe I'll start with the bed that felt like a plank of wood covered with a thin blanket? The cold shower is not something i would complain about since I didn't get it at 8 of the 9 hotels I stayed at. The area around the hotel is in the main shopping area of Karol Bagh. It's not the safest area to start out in, but you can get good bargains, and it's close to the metro. They offer free internet but it's really slow. The phone in the room is on a rotary dial system. On the bright side, the room was large, the hard bed turned out to be relatively comfortable, and room service was attentive, if not on the annoying side. "
hotel mehar castle ,"an excellent location for stay.. Hotel provides good hospitality..we were provided with a family room which had two double beds..which was perfect for my wife and my two children. Good service,good food.. "
hotel mehar castle ,"A fairly decent hotel My wife and I stayed in Room # 208 (Double Deluxe Room at INR 1690/night, as advertised on their web site).Location: within about 5 minutes' walk to Karol Bagh metro station. Plenty of street shops and vendors in the daytime.Quite a spacious room with sitting area, marble floors. Not spotlessly clean maybe, but quite decent. Hard mattresses, aircon working but wouldn't set to heating, though staff provided additional blankets on request. Still, as the draught was coming through the window we had to move our bed to the middle of the room every night and back every morning. Noise protection next to non-existent, so all door bangs and loud conversations in the corridor are heard very clearly, and so is the work in the street.No reading lights.Bathroom has definitely seen better days. There was hot water in the shower, though the pressure was barely adequate.Good staff. Excellent food – probably the best vegetable fried rice we had during our two-week trip. "
hotel metro heights ,"excellent stay in good price I have stayed in many hotels in India, Metro Heights was the best of the hotel especially in karol bagh area.The staff is friendly ,the rooms were clean and well decoated with a big L.C.D. Bathrooms were neat and hot water in the showers is available.I have no hasseles in the hotel every time i have stayed here.The price they take is also not exorbitant. "
hotel metro heights ,"unreliable the hotel provided a very uneven experience al round. Certainly there were some nice touches in the room, such as the beautifully carved bed, but it looked out on the interior service stairwell. The staff who actually did the work were lovely - but the management were dreadful and couldn't have cared less when we arrived back after travelling for 23 hours to find that, even though we were pre-paid, they'd put someone else in our room and we had nowjere to stay! After a huge row they transferred us to a scruffier sister property, closer to the market and with much more pleasant management. The Indian breakfast is great - don't even bother with the European one. I guess it all depends on what you want in a hotel - we're not after 5-star treatment, but some consistency would be a good start. "
hotel metro heights ,clean and convenient We were particularly happy with the convenient and central location Metro Heights had to offer us in delhi near the metro sation connecting to all parts of delhi .We reached Metro Heights at middle of the night and had our confirmed bookin so were checked in and found a decent accommodation in what we had paid ($70 usd).The next morning the buffett breakfast was well laid and was hot and were served eggs to order as well .We decided to continue our stay in the hotel instead of looking for another hotel in the area.The staff was proffessional and friendly.dont expect out of the way service..BUT WE DIDNT REGRET THE DECISION TO STAY AT METRO HEIGHTS. 
hotel metro heights ,metro height was good value for money and safe We booked the hotel through the website which looked quite attractive and were promised a pickup from airport.The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about 30 minutes. we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in . staright went to the bath room and had nice hot water shower( i was not sure i would get hot water )we were hungry so asked for food and was told that it is available 24 hours.The food took some time to come as we were ttold that it is cooked fresh.Food was not bad.Next morning we went to the restaurant serving breakfast somewhere down it was good set up and decent enough considering it was in the package as complimentary.MOST imp. Part of our stay was that the hotel was clean and safe for family. 
hotel metro heights ,"just about ok We stayed at the Metro Heights as a part of an organised tour, so we had little info on the hotel beforehand. I wouldn't have booked the hotel if I had had any choice. On the other hand, the hotel wasn't the worst one we stayed in India, but that is not a lot. The room itself was reasonably clean (including the bathroom), and there was enough hot(tish) water, although the bathtub was cracked so that only showering was possible. However, the room (211 if I remember correctly) was quite basic and there was some noise from the street. There were no insects and the linen was clean, but I was also woken up in the middle of the night by an earbreaking buzzing noise when someone pressed the room doorbell for no reason.What I disliked the most was the staff. They were either absolutely indifferent to the needs and requests of their clients to the point of being rude or grovelingly polite in order to get a tip. No real service anywhere: you get things done if you ask, but no effort is made without you asking. The breakfast was a tired-looking buffet and the evening meal that we had there was not special in any way.The Karol Bagh area offers little for the tourist: all the sights and wonders of Delhi are at least a taxi ride away. In Karol Bagh, there is a bazaar and some shops, but overall nothing really interesting. It takes about 30 minutes in a moped-rickshaw to the Red Fort and slightly less to New Delhi (Connaught place). "
hotel metro heights ,"OK We stayed at Hotel Metro Heights as part of an 'Intrepid' tour so had little choice in the booking of it. I think because we were part of a tour group we were reserved the worst rooms available!We stayed there at the start and end of our tour, although if we hadnt pre-booked as part of the tour we probably would have chosen not to go back.Our first room didnt have a window which struck us as a bit odd until we discovered that you have to pay extra for a window, even odder, never before had I considered windows as an unessential luxury! Although I guess one benefit of no window was that there were fewer traffic sounds to keep us awake. The second room we stayed in did have a window (after arguing with unhelpful staff) and was cleaner and larger but was next to the first floor office of the hotel so we were kept awake by the phone incessantly ringing and people shouting in the halls.All in all I think Hotel Metro Heights was fine but not great value for money, especially as it is out in Karol Bagh (not particularly central or interesting part of Delhi). The staff were largely unhelpful and the included breakfast left a lot to be desired. Cost approximately RS 2600 which I would say was daylight robbery for the level of service provided. If you shop around I'm sure you could get a lot more for your money. "
hotel metro heights ,"avoid at all cost even when in packagedeal. This hotel, which offers room for 75 usd, but books through agents for only 20, we found to be a filthy dump. Any basic idea of hygiene is alien to them and on top of that not one staffmember is interested in the guest. Most rooms are mere cupboards with a bed, with no windows. Our first room, 208, was grimy to the hilt. Imagine a fan, black with soot, which splatters the fat dirt around your bathroom when turning. After a row and an intervention from our agent we moved to 106, which they 'cleaned' beforehand. Hot water is mostly off. Linen is dirty, the breakfastroom is disgusting as is the breakfast. We met groups of complaining people at all times of day. No sleep before 12pm, for the hotel is situated in the midst of the wholesale autotrade, hotelstaff starts banging around at 0530. Staff-sideentrance is open at all times, so no security at all on all floors. "
hotel metro heights ,Reception staff are awful This must have the worst reception staff ever. You could have up to 7 behind the counter (doing nothing) and yet it seems too much trouble to even acknowledge that a customer is waiting to ask a question.The hotel rooms appear dark and uninviting. There are many hotels in Karol Bagh so just go to one of the others and check out the rooms. Avoid this place if possible. 
hotel metro heights ,"Returned later in trip and walked out. We had stayed here earlier in our trip. At that time we were given the promised room, number 111. However we were showed two new rooms this time as 111 was taken. The two new rooms were bad compared to 111. One room had the smell of sewage. The front desk could not find us a comfortable room. The front desk again refused to provide air conditioning. We were disappointed in the take it or leave it attitude which is becoming more prevalent in New Delhi with the paucity of hotel rooms. We chose not to support this behavior by staying here again, and we moved next door to the Hotel Singh Sahib. "
hotel metro heights ,"Terrible Looks O.K at the main desk, but rooms are very average.We had to stay here twice, at the start of our trip and at the end a few weeks later, as it was already pre-booked.23 days in India at various hotels, but this was the worst.Hotel staff are unfriendly, and un co-operative, especially towards females.Only stay here if you must or if it is part of you tour package. "
hotel metro heights ,"not metro heights Metro Heights.The ambience of a budget hotel but not a price to match.We walked into the foyer and thought this place looks ok, and that was as good as it got. Our room had water marks on the wall. The timber door frame in the bathroom was rotten and the air conditioner hardly worked.The day staff on the counter delivered a service that was akin to that of Faulty Towers where any request was received as an inconvenience. We asked for clean towels which arrived after 90 minutes and an additional request. A Request for an extra bed in the room took a couple of hours. To actually get the attention of the staff was an exercise in patience where we had to wait for them to stop watching the telly in the lobby or to stop chatting to their friends who would often drop by for a social visit. The location in Carolbahg is now in the middle of a car services area where every second shop seems to specialise in car speakers or window tinting. The meals were OK. We had a couple of breakfasts and a dinner which weren't overly expensive. The table cloths looked like the same ones that were on the table after we retuned from a fifteen day tour. "
hotel metro heights ,"If you can afford book another hotel Metro Heights is sort of best-you-can-get in the lower price range (up to $ 75) in Delhi. It is simple, has dark rooms (the one we had did not even have windows) and especially on the ground floor you hear a lot of noise from the reception. Beds are ok but short, bathroom is clean but nothing fancy. This is a hotel for just sleeping, not to spent time there. Breakfast consist of a number of hot Indian dishes, toast and coffee/tea. A number of Dutch travel groups use the hotel, I think because they can't find anything better in that price range too. "
hotel metro heights ,"Poor service at the Metro The Hotel Metro Heights, in Karolbagh, Delhi was our base in Delhi during our 3 week trip to India. This was my first trip to India, although my wife and her parents, whom we were travelling with, had visited before, so I kind of knew not to expect too much.The hotel itself is in a dusty busy side street some 15 minutes, by autorickshaw, from Connaught Place. It's within walking distance of the Karolbagh shopping areas, which is a bonus if you are into shopping.The rooms are okay. We stayed in three different rooms, on three different occassions as we were travelling and staying in other towns as well. The hotel kindly and safely kept a large number of our luggage that we did not require while travelling. The quality of the rooms vary. Some do not have bath tubs, while some do. Some are smaller than others. Generally the bathrooms and rooms are clean and tidy if not of the best quality.The problems:1) If you do not hand your key in when going out in the morning your room does not get made up!2) We were given damp pillow cases and towels the one night. The excuse being that due to it being winter, laundry does not dry!3) Breakfasts are appalling and is served in a dinghy basement that does not really encourage you to eat. We had requested a packed breakfast for one early morning start. Instead the hotel insisted that they would have a hot breakfast ready for us. This did not happen and we ended up eating just bread and a boiled egg.4) The overall service is just poor and they have to be pushed real hard to get anything done.5) Warm water is not hot water, a concept that this hotel just did not understand.6) The rooms can be quite noisy given it's location, there is a flyover quite close by. The staff are also noisy during their shift changes. They are also renovating some rooms and have a tendency to work till quite late unless you shout at the the night clerk.Stay here if you must but skip the breakfasts and be prepared for poor service. "
hotel metro heights ,"Good place to stay in Karol Bagh The hotel is decently priced and closer to the main shopping strip in Karol Bagh; however, being a few blocks away ensures that the road noise is minimal.The Suites are around $75 including breakfast and are quite large. The service has been better than other hotels and when the internet access was not working, they called someone in on a Sunday to check it out.I would stay here again. "
hotel metro heights ,"cheap and good for a night We chose this place to be near the train station as we flew in at midnight and needed to catch a 7am train.the room was small but he A/c worked and the twin beds were clean and not too hard. The shower was not totally clean, but for our 5 hours, it was fine. Only problem was that we couldn't find the hallway lightswitch and it was dark trying to leave the hotel!Can't comment on the veiws or location, as we were too tired and it was our first night in India.Paid $40 for the double.

hotel mohan international ,"Please do not stay here Liked most: Leaving!Liked least: Hard sell of tour/travel packagesWe only stayed for two nights, but wouldn't have stayed for any had we not already paid via the internet. If you're thinking of staying at this hotel, please don't. I just don't want anyone else to have the same experience as us.We arranged for transport from the airport which proved very useful, and the car driver was on time and very friendly. The hotel itself was down an alleyway, but I guess a lot of Delhi hotels are. The room was a good size, but even if the sheets and pillowcases had been cleaned, they certainly didn't look it. We ended up putting tshirts on the pillows before we dared lay our heads on them! The area is very noisy at night. We couldn't shut out the noise from outside as there was an air con unit fitted to the window - not that it worked, as the plug had been cut off. Inside the hotel was also very noisy with staff shouting to one another and music playing. Could also hear another hotel guest being very ill in the room upstairs... Yuk! Always seemed to be about 10 staff around, and except for the very smiley doorman, no-one seemed to do much unless they thought there was a good chance of a tip! On the first day, we asked reception for directions to the train station but he insisted on calling the manager. The manager arrived. Again, we asked directions. So when he led us outside and through the streets, we naively thought he was taking us there - no, he was taking us to the Mohan's sister hotel where he proceeded to 'hard sell' his tour packages. After an hour of explaining we weren't ready to buy anything, we left and he was obviously unhappy about it - not offering any help in locating the train station or even returning to the Mohan. We were now in an area completely unknown to us, in the middle of Delhi, on our first day there. To say this was a bit scary is an understatement, and just underlines how little the Mohan International thinks of their guests - perhaps people who do buy their travel packages get treated a lot better.Please don't stay here unless you know the area, don't mind the noise, are able to say 'no' very forcefully, and are completely financially unable to stay elsewhere. I honestly think the good reviews on tripadvisor must have been put up by the manager, employees or friends of the hotel because I can't imagine any other reason why people would recommend this hotel to others.Please don't stay here. "
hotel mohan international ,"Clean but Basic Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Mohan International this month for one night and although the room was very basic it was clean. As other people mentioned in their reviews there were stains on the sheets and the fact that my friends had a man sleeping on the floor outside of their room was very weird. I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget as it was cheap and it was a good location. I wouldn't recommend the hotel to women travellers (as we were), as there were times when we felt quite uncomfortable. "
hotel mohan international ,"Not worth it Bottom line - don't stay here. It's totally over-priced, and there must be better hotels nearby. The guy who worked the front desk was horrendous - when I asked him for directions to a specific restaurant, he asked me why I didn't just order room service, and refused to help me. When I tried to book a taxi to the airport, he tried to charge me double what we paid on our way in. The hotel is very noisy, and the free &quot;breakfast&quot; was pretty disgusting. "
hotel mohan international ,"Not a very good hotel at all! Stayed here for 3 days having booked on Expedia. It must have been decades since this hotel was last refurbished. The underside of the basin was covered in rust. Though the bedsheet you sleep on had been washed it still had old marks and stains on it. There are no bedsheetsto sleep under, just these rugs - not sure if they're washed regularlytoo.If you get a ground floor room don't expect to sleep until late! Noiseof buzzers (for people calling from their room) and voices through thelate evening and early the next morning make it very difficult.Oh, and they give the hard sell on getting you to visit their travel agent. We did and ended up getting a package but only after refusing some of the hotels he offered as Tripadvisor had some shocking reviewsfor one or two. The other hotels were good and having a driver for a week (which they offered) as well as having everything organised for you was actually really convenient so glad we did it. If your driver is a man called Mahender, you're lucky - he's really really lovely man- always cheery and got great advice! "
hotel mohan international ,Avoid this dump !!!!! Avoid this place - you may have seen in advertised on the STA website but I would guess that STA have not stayed here. It is a very basic hotel and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. We paid 15 UK pounds per night as we wanted our first few nights accomodation sorted out before we arrived but with hindsight there are a lot of similar hotels in the area which are much cheaper if you just walk in off the street.The management also hassled us to try and get us to book tours through them and were very reluctant to accept NO for an answer.The only advantage to this place is its proximity to New Delhi Railway station but as I say there are many other hotels in the immediate area which offer better value for money.Get a Lonely Planet and make some phone calls. 
hotel mohan international ,"Worst hotel were we stayed! First of all the airport pickup didn't show up. After calling several times he eventually did, but 2 hours late. Rooms in the hotel are reasonable, but the staff is horrible. The &quot;manager&quot; kept stalking me on the hotelroom phone about tours he wanted to sell, they staff didn't let me out of the hotel alone but were almost agressively pushy about arranging a city-tour. Even at 4 o'clock in the morning they were banging on the door and calling on the phone about tours. Very much noise at night. Left one night early because i couldn't stand it anymore. I'm used to budget travel, the rooms were OK but the rest made me want to run away! There are much better hotels in this area, sometimes even cheaper... "
hotel mohan international ,"Total Scam Stay Away What a scam. There are atleast 50 other similar hotels around this one and you don't need to book this online. If you are looking for this price range, simply get off the train at the main station, walk around, ask to look at the room and the bed sheets before you select one, BUT DON&quot;T GO WITH HOTEL MOHAN. Its dirty, noisy, expensive, and not worth the hassle. Front desk is not helpful. I got this hotel from another site and based on the listing, I figured it would be a reasonable place. But what a mistake. Like I said, if you are looking for that price range, simply walk around the area and check out the room before you buy.I asked for a driver and they gave me one that got us into an accident the same day. I asked for internet, and they had me driven to their sister location 10 minutes away when infact there were several places right down the road. "
hotel mohan international ,"Shame on Hotel Club!! I spent five weeks in India from Mid December till the end of January. Unfortunately, my first two nights were spent at this ridiculous excuse for a hotel. First of all, Hotel Club is absolutely LYING about their location indicating that they are located at Connaught Place where several five star hotels are located including the famous Imperial Hotel. In fact, this place is located at the MAIN TRAIN STATION area which is a full 8 minutes by TAXI and quite a dangerous area even in the daytime. I am a solo woman traveler in her 30's and did not appreciate this deception. Secondly, the price charged by Hotel Club (20 euros night) is OUTRAGEOUS for Delhi for a hotel of this type and shameful considering the condition. I checked other accomodation around this place and their prices for a single room with hot water, private toilette etc was in the $8-$12 range. Thirdly, the cleanliness factor was overlooked as the sheets were SMEARED with some dark substance I chose not to closely investigate and requested new sheets. The floor attendant graciously brought some but after I opened them I discovered that they too were dirty and never cleaned prior to being pressed. Thank goodness I had a sleep sheet packed and used that! Fourthly, the man who collects the dirty sheets in the morning would smoke marajuana every day and the elevator was full of the smoke. I am asthmatic so this was not amusing. Lastly, there was not even any heating (in December) and it was freezing and no hot water in the shower (in December). I stay in simple accomodation sometimes, but they are usually clean and pleasant. I sent Hotel Club a prompt review of this hotel and am shocked to see this HORRIFIC Place is still on offer to unsuspecting guests. "
hotel mohan international ,"basic but clean and central We ebooked in advance and arranged a car to meet us at the airport, a very good tip as you WILL be ripped off by taxi drivers, they can sense newcomers. the hotel was clean, the loos flushed and the shower/fan and a/c worked. On arrival we felt we were stuck down an alleyway in a seemingly grotty part of town. It turns out most of Delhi looks like this, it takes a bit of getting used to. Mohan is easy to find as it is directly behind the sheila cinema. we had no problem with the management, however, do not use the inhouse travel agent for taxi tours or car booking, we chose to use the ajanta hotels (200m away), even then we were advised to book from the company directly, as commission is charged by all operators involved. Also bring your own loo roll, although it can be bought from the shop/ std phone stall at the end of the street. I am sure we paid over the odds, but as i say it was worth it to avoid the hassle that you will get from touts, taxi drivers and 'helpful' strangers who want tipped for their advice. "

hotel namaskar ,"Awful Yes its cheap, yes its close to the station, but its awful. was not under any illusions as to getting much for our money - wasn't expecting an amazing place for the price but i wish we had paid a little more and stayed somewhere better. The room was horrible, the bathroom was filthy - i did not wash while i was there, we arrived to find cigarette butts in the toilet, sheets where dirty, We also saw several cockroaches (although this isnt exactlyt unusual in Delhi) the tipping point came when we could hear buzzing in the room which we though to be the electricity or fan, so after turning them on and off afew times we were stumped as to what it could be; went to go back to sleep picked up my pillow to reveal 2 huge cockroaches underneath it. WRANK. "

"
hotel namaskar ,"friendly staff hot water and a bed what more do you need? I stayed at the Hotel Namaskar when I first arrived in India on the 25th January. I had arranged for their airport pickup, which was waiting as promised at the airport. The journey to the hotel was hair-raising to say the least, but then it was my first experience of Indian driving!On arriving at the bazaar, the car had to park a bit away due to the road being dug up, but the driver carried my bags to the hotel for me. I had a double room, clean and reasonably comfortable for 300 rupees a night. The toilet worked and the hot water was supplied by a boiler outside the room, which also worked. The staff were very friendly, the young Nepalese boys were great, and the other counter staff could not have been more helpful. The owner is a little intimidating, but once you get used to him he is actually quite nice. They searched online for me and found me a great flight price for my return from Goa. I stayed three nights before setting off on my travels around India. I returned for one night after flying back from Goa, prior to flying home the next day. Unfortunately the booking had been missed, but they did find me a room, not quite as good as the first but adequate for one night. Overall I felt very safe here, and it was a good introduction to India, I stayed in hotels that cost far more and provided less in other places! "
hotel namaskar ,"For Rs300 this is what you get Good location close to New Delhi train station, friendly staff, 1 hot shower available if you ask, very basic rooms, bit run down.

hotel namaskar ,"Hotel Namaskar - No Thanks I recently booked a room at hotel Namaskar and arrived around 7 am. By the time I arrived at the hotel, the door was locked.

After wasting about 5 minutes on the phone while looking at the guy I was talking to, he finally let me in the door.Even though I booked the room online and got a confirmation email, I was told that the room would not be available until noon. Around 10 am, the owner came in and let me have the room 2 hours early. He said the usual charge for early check in was 1/2 what I was quoted by the guys when I came in. Once entering the room, it did not look very clean (I took the 400 rupee room). The bathroom was fairly small and the toilet looked very dirty. The bed did not look like the sheets were clean either. Luckily, I took the advise of another traveler and brought my own sheet to cover the bed and sleep on.I stayed another night and was moved to a smaller room (300 rupees). The second room was dirtier than the first. The sheets had not been changed and the room had not been cleaned since the last guest left. Upon entry into the room, both of the sheets covering the mattress had blood stains on them. There was an empty package of lingerie on the bed. The bathroom was a lot smaller than the first one and this one did not even have hot water in it. To get hot water, you have to take a bucket down the hall and bring it back to your room.As far as the room being cheap, not really. Yes, you can get a room as cheap as 300 rupees. But, it is not clean, and there is nothing in the rooms but a bed and bathroom (no tv, nothing). Also, international flights usually arrive very late or very early in the morning. You pay for the room from noon to noon. If you get the larger room with the water heater (no ac), you will pay 400 rupees for the room until noon. Of course, you will not leave at noon, so you will have to pay another 400 rupees to stay overnight. Thats 800 rupees for pretty much 1 day in their hotel. For 800 rupees, you can find a much better place.The staff was friendly, but in a crooked sort of way. When I asked about a good restaurant in the area, I was told that they would get me the food and deliver it to my room. I gave them 102 rupees for the food. When they returned, they did not provide me with change or a receipt. When I asked about the cost, I was told &quot;It's ok&quot; and they left.They are proud of being recommended by Lonely Planet. I was shown a copy of Lonely Planet and the recommendation by the author to stay there and book tours through Namaskar. They do take a rather large commission on the booking of the tours. The cost was about 33% higher than the cost the driver normally charges. While on the road, the driver stopped at some local shops so that I could do some shopping. Of course, these were shops where he would earn commission if I bought something and the prices were grossly inflated. 2 shops I did not even ask him to stop at or even make the slightest inclination that I was interested in purchasing the type of goods sold there. He just stopped and said it was part of the tour.The hotel offers to keep your luggage for you if you go out on a trip. I would not recommend this. While leaving, I was handed someone else's bag. If I were a dishonest person, I could have walked away with somebody's luggage.I stayed at Hotel Namaskar after reading some reviews on a website that claimed it was a good deal and it was clean. If you want a clean place at a reasonable rate, look elsewhere. "
hotel namaskar ,"Very cheap in the heart of Paharganj We booked the hotel for its price and reccomendation of guidebooks. The area of Paharganj is not the best in Delhi, so if you want anything remotely fancy don't stay here. The hotel looked like one of many in the area, which is packed, but we didn't have any hassle in our stay at all.The room is clean enough and very big, with some weird cables hanging from the wall, and a not very nice toilet with not very warm wather.They can arrange the pick-up from the airport, which saves you lots of hassle if you are not used to the india-taxi way of life.Also, they can organise tours around Delhi and Rajastan, though they take a fairly big commission and if you have the chance, you would do best booking straight from a driver.Our stay was not memorable, but it served perfectly its purpose of having a cheap place to sleep in Delhi. "
hotel namaskar ,"Very cheap you get what you pay for Found this through Lonely Planet, one of the few places that was very responsive to my email inquiry. Their airport pick-up service was on-time and waiting for me, but I did not feel safe in the minivan they drove, which was very old, has poor shock absorbers, and no seatbelt. At one point the car hit a speedbump too fast and I flung forward, knocking the front passenger seat out of place. The reception and staff are friendly and helpful, but they are always a bit too eager to book tours for you.The hotel is located in the Paharganj, in an alley just off the main market street. This is a very active, loud, and dusty area, and there is a public urinal at the entrance of the alley. It is walking distance to the metro (Rama Krishna Ashram Marg station), and one metro stop away from Connaught Place.My room &quot;double&quot; room was very spartan, there were two twin beds pushed together and just enough space to walk around it, and a small table in the corner. Walls were pink, as warned in Lonely Planet. The windows were blacked out, but I could hear the street noise and the heavily polluted street air made its way into the room. There was also a ceiling fan and a/c. The bathroom was small, and there is no separation between the shower and the toilet (this is standard for most hotels in India). No hot showers, as there was no hot water in the room - they provide you with a large bucket and you retrieve hot water from a tap down the hall. Also, the only available electrical outlet in my room had been taped onto the wall.The room appeared clean enough, but as with most hotels in India, the room does not get serviced daily. Bathroom looked kind of disgusting with a lot of water stains and water damagede door. Toilet paper is not provided. The sheets were clean, some more threadbare than others, all had some stubborn stains or cigarette burns. I stayed for 4 nights and got very sick from the poor air quality (this is clearly evident when you blow your nose at the end of the day). Essentially, you get what you pay for. Many locals avoid the Paharganj area because it is even too chaotic for them to endure, but it does have lots of shops, tourists, internet cafes, and cheap eateries. As a tourist, you can also expect and get used to being hassled a lot. "
hotel namaskar ,"Friends from other hotel This hotel is recommended by Lonely Planet. The problem of accomodation being recommended by Lonely Planet is that the hotel will tend to be over booked or over popular. This Hotel Namaskar is the first on top of the budget hotel list, so we called to make reservation two days before we reach Delhi. The person who takes the call said the rooms are alway available and we can come to stay any time.When we reach Delhi, we went straight to the hotel which we had made reservation and I saw my name on the reservation book too. Then the man at the counter ask his man to show the room for me. At the point of time, I realised something was wrong, the man took me to other hotel which do not even known to me. I realised later that the hotel that we want to stay is full. So in order not to loose any chance of earning a little more income, the owner without even telling us what happen took us to the other hotel nearby which probably will give him some commission if he &quot;defer&quot; a customer to his hotel. "
hotel namaskar ,"Basic in the Bazaar Basic hotel in the Main Bazaar area. Rooms are cheap, relatively clean but very basic. The staff and especially the two brothers are extremely helpful and can arrange for tours at very reasonable prices both in Delhi and wider India. It is this that is the main attraction.Up a small alley off the main bazaar you have to pass an open urinal at the start of the alley. The location is not for the faint hearted as you are pitched into the noise and squalour of Old Dehli on your doorstep although personal safety was never an issue. "
hotel namaskar ,"cheap clean noisy I spent 3 nights in Namaskar hotel. The people of the hotel can take you from the airport, even during the night, for 400 rupies (8 euros). They can book a taxi for you, and many other things. They can keep some of your luggage (even a computer) a few weeks until you come back. It is really near main bazar street.We spent 2 nights in a room for 2oo rupies (4 euros) for 2 people. Their was too much noise (because of the fan and the corridor), too much light during the night, some problems with the water (there was no more water during one hour maybe). The room was clean.We spent another night in a 450 rupies room (9 euros). It was really bigger, with 2 bathrooms, but as much noise and light. However, I don't know if it is possible to have better hotels for less than 600 rupies a night in Delhi, where so many hotels are &quot;expensve&quot; (for India) and of bad quality.If you want to sleep in this hotel it is better to phone them to book the nights you want before you come to Delhi. If you arrive from the airport it is better to ask them to send you a taxi to avoid a lot of problems the first day !!!!(a french tourist) "

hotel omni ,My Stay in Delhi Booked via Makemytrip. Hotel is average. Location is midst of Karol bagh the populated area of Old Delhi. Close to many places though. We stayed here as we needed to visit US Consulate for an Interview. Room was very good though no balcony. AC was good. Had a problem with the bathroom lock. Got locked out from inside. Bathroom has new jacuuzi but it was not that effective and was malfunctioning. Room service was very good. Got value for money to some extent. TV was good. Was an LCD. Would recommend. 
hotel omni ,"oh ma gosh ...plz never stay here i went to Delhi for a tour with my family consisting of 3 members.we had actually booked rooms in an other hotel but we reached late at nite coz of the big traffic block in delhi .the other hotel people said that the room was not available at nite and that they have arranged room in a nearby hotel i.e; omni .we agreed and when we reached there the chechk in counters we gud but the room were just horrible ...it was very small and very conjusted ..we could hardly move around ...the bed spread , linens etc were so untidy and had a foul smell ..now to talk bout the bathrooms i better dont say anything .it was so untidy and i think it hadn't been cleaned for an year . the rooms were so dark and we couldnt differentiate between nite and day . it was such a horrible experience . the services were ok . next day we were shifted to the hotel which we had booked(not omni) . thank god i was shifted . the other hotel was gud .but i wud say to everybody that never go and stay in this hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
hotel omni ,Omni hotel did not honor reservation I reserved a superior room for one night through the Venere travel agency.(They had all my credit card information) When I arrived at the hotel at 2:00A.M.after the 20 hour trip from New York City I was told the hotel was filled and could not stay there.I was offered a room at another hotel which I declined. My voucher for the room for the night was deemed meaningless. An Iranian Tour operator was also having a problem with arrangements that had been made months before. A reservation at the hotel might be honored if no one else takes your room before you arrive.I would warn you against staying at a hotel run by such shabby people. 
hotel omni ,"Not a hotel but a hole I'm working in India for a couple of weeks and decided to visit Delhi. BCDTravel from India booked the hotel. The place is just terrible. The area in where it is is awful, you feel like you're going to get killed the moment you put a feet outside the hotel (I know in general the zones in India don't look good, but really this is one of the worst areas there). The rooms are very dirty, smells, i even found 10 empty bottles of beer in front of my room when i arrived (no one worried to at least throw them at that moment) and also when o left the next day. Don't follow the tramp of the pictures, they must be edited because it's not like the pictures at all. The rate for a hotel like this should be less than US$10, not more. "
hotel omni ,value for money i booked my hotel from the website and i made the payment from ther and i wa scared that the hotel is good enough or not but when i reached the airport i was welcomed like a person of my family has came to recive me and it was of a different class and when i reached the hotel it was like i have paid nothing for the hotel ppl say that that it is value for money but i will say it was more than value for money one difficulty i experienced that was i was that tv cabel was not working for 2 hour or so but later it was corrected so i will recamend each and everybody to visit this hotel and the hotel website is [--] 
hotel omni ,"No I don't want to go to Agra. I am used to staying at inexpensive Indian hotels as well as Western style hotels in India. Usually, the Indian hotels above a certain price range (like more than US$15/night) are fine with some shabbiness in the facilities. Other than the bathroom, my room was clean and comfortable, and even the bathroom was okay if not spotless. They provided a kettle and some instant coffee/tea too (although the mug was dirty with dried coffee inside.) The hotel has free (!) wireless Internet, a real convenience. But I would never stay here again because it's pretty clear it's a scam for the travel agency that owns/is partnered with it.I should have known when I arrived this place was into fleecing people. I tipped the guy who carried my bags. Later, he hunted me down because the bill was 'ripped'. I know that India has this wierd thing about bills not being legal tender if they are ripped, but there's apparently some exchange process where you take the old bill to a bank and they'll replace it, and this bill was ancient, but intact--not actually ripped. I'm 90% sure this guy brought the bill back because he thought he deserved a bigger tip, and of course since I didn't have any other small bills of the same denomination, I did give him a bigger tip. I wouldn't do that now.Can I just say, I am sooooo sick of the following sequence of questions:1. Sir, where are you from? What is your good name? 2. How long are you in staying in Delhi? (answer, 2 days)3. Have you ever been to India? (yes, 5 times)4. What are you doing today? (ummm, some work, maybe going to visit some friends)5. Would you like a package tour to the Taj Mahal in Agra? (or the more forceful 'you *would* like a package tour to the Taj Mahal.') And usually a refusal to take no for an answer.I was asked _seven_ times to go to the Taj by the hotel staff--desk clerks, bellhop, including one extended conversation in which they claimed there was some problem with my hotels.com reservation, then took me to a travel agency a block away to have them 'check my reservation' and 'give feedback to the management' and three guys took turns trying to sell me tours. The next day I get an unscheduled wakeup call. I'm dead asleep, a call to the room wakes me up, and he asks about my 'hotel voucher,' &quot;I gave you the reservation sheet yesterday&quot;, &quot;What are you doing today?&quot;, &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;, &quot;You should go to Agra today&quot;, I slam down the phone. Even just leaving the hotel, the desk clerk stops me, asks my room number, then interrogates me about my plans again (same guy as that morning on the phone? I don't know). I'm used to touts. But the hotel staff honestly seem to think I owe them a booking on some overpriced tour. It's like one of those condo timeshare sales pitches that lasts your entire stay in the hotel. Never again will I stay here!Checking out was more of the same. Again with the upselling. So first they get all huffy, and they're like &quot;you have to pay at check out!&quot; Um, yes, I normally expect that at a hotel. But again they are frustrated because my 'voucher' is not a voucher, but a reservation through hotels.com (not prepaid, in this case.) Okay, so I try to pay. Despite the lovely lucite stand sitting on the check in desk saying &quot;We accept visa/master/american express&quot; they refuse to take my card. &quot;Well we don't take cards for such a small amount.&quot; Yeah, like $80 is too small an amount to charge--in India, where I've seen merchants set minimum charge amounts near $2. And it's not like it's some old decal stuck in a place where it can't be removed, or some sponsored sign that has other information on it. It's a brand new sign sitting on the desk that says only that they take the credit cards. Okay, I'll pay cash. Then they refuse to give me a receipt. And the reason? Because they say my internet reservation is my receipt! I just hand this guy a wad of cash, and he's telling me the same piece of paper I had before I paid is now proof of payment. I pushed the issue and got upset, and refused to leave until I had a receipt (fearing that they would then charge my credit card used in the reservation as well and claim they'd never received the cash.) Again with the trip to the travel agency around the corner to speak to the 'management'. He says 'we'll have to charge you more if you get a receipt. We have to include luxury tax then.' and I say 'and you would have cheated the government of the tax otherwise?' The guy says again and again, &quot;we are very honest, how would we stay in business otherwise?&quot; Right after admitting to me he's stealing from the public coffers. And again with the upselling. &quot;Where are you going now? You should just hire a car for the day, only 1100 rupees.&quot; In the end the ride to the airport cost me 500, even though my Indian friend had taken the same ride, also booked through the hotel, the previous day for 350. As I'm getting into the car, the hotel guy says 'well it's 500 for the ride, but 600 if you want A/C'. Well fine then, I don't want A/C. I spend half the ride arguing. Driver tries to sell me on how great the A/C is, then he tries to pull the &quot;I am but a humble servant, and it's so hot, won't you please pay for A/C? Please sir! Please!&quot; I know full well he's getting 150% of the real fare, and I'm not gonna pay him one paisa more on the bait and switch. I tell him if he wants the A/C so badly he should pay the 100 rupees (and he'd still be making more than normal off me!). At this point it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing with the hidden charges etc. I've had to yell at three people from the hotel just to get them to leave me alone. And in approximately 5 months of traveling in India over a period of several years, I've had to resort to yelling when someone just wouldn't take no for an answer only twice before this hotel--once with a beggar who tried to stop me from walking down the sidewalk by blocking my path for about 10 minutes straight, and once with a dishonest internet cafe host.Please, please don't even bother trying this hotel. Karol Bagh is full of comparable hotels at generally lower prices that don't come with a fulltime harrassment program. "
hotel omni ,"Hotel Omni is not a hotel I got hotel booked from my indian partners &amp; this is the worst hotel I've every stayed in! I happened to stay here last month &amp; everything from the service to the rooms were just terrible. The first thing you'll notice would be the smell of damp linen... everything from the bed sheets to pillows stunk with the smell. Check In system was horrible . I left the next morning since it was late in the night and staying in a neighbouring much cheaper, but much cleaner and nicer hotel! I didn't get enough time in India to be able to get the hotel closed, but if I ever do this is the first thing I would do! "
hotel omni ,Feel like 5 star hotel. Excellent place to live! Stayed there for a week. Great service. Awesome staff! Rooms are 5 star standard. Definitely you will get value for money to stay here. I will strongly recommend. 
hotel palace heights ,Good but noisy We stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception. All the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard in our room all night. Also there were some cat fights under the window providing more noise. Try to get a room far away from the reception and/or wear earplugs.Eevrything else worked OK. 
hotel palace heights ,"Good Place to Stay This hotel is fairly small but well sited in the middle of Delhi in Connaught Place. Rooms are variable in size but well appointed for us.Staff areexcellent and very helpful, whilst the attached restaurant has excellent food and service.Connaught Place itself is undergoing extensive restoration, so there is quite a bit of mess in the area.Only trouble with the hotel is that is no lounge area for friends to meet, but you can use the restaurant for this purpose without difficulty. "
hotel palace heights ,"Centrally located clean and with a good restaurant As with other reviews the driver was unsure exactly where this hotel was on Connaught Circus. I recognised it as It looked exactly like the pictures on tripadvisor. Greeting was pleasant, room was small but clean and well appointed. Restaurant was excellent. Location was so central for that part of Delhi with plenty of shops, clubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk.There was some noise, perhaps from the cinema, but it wasn't unbearable. I'd definitely stay here again.By the way don't think about visiting the (fairly nearby) Indian Coffee House - what a dump! "
hotel palace heights ,"Clean rooms great service good location and value The staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean. It was also quiet which was great as it was daylight when we finally got to sleep, due to jet lag, yet we didn't hear any of the usual daytime traffic noise. The hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week while we visited some cities in Rajastan. Overall, a very enjoyable stay at a great price - Don't be put off by the exterior, it's great inside. "
hotel palace heights ,"Took our money and left us stranded on the streets of delhi at night! My husband and I have traveled widely around India, yet nothing prepared us for the predicament we faced when we booked in to this hotel! Having consulted TripAdvisor and seen the high rating of Hotel Palace Heights we clicked on the booking which led us to hotels.com (expedia.in) through which we booked this hotel for 2 nights. Our booking confirmation from hotels .com came through and my husband's credit card was charged the full amount. We took a print out of the confirmation and having travelled via train from shimla we arrived at new delhi at 10 pm at night to be met with bewilderment at the front desk of the hotel palace heights! They saw our booking confirmation and said that they had not received any booking and that they had no rooms available for us. Without any apology they said that it must have been hotels.com's fault as they had NOT RECEIVED ANY BOOKING! We being visitors to Delhi did not know what to do next. Attempts to reach hotel.com at that hour failed so we were left in a dilemma as to where to spend the night. We eventually did manage to find an overpriced and badly located hotel later that night but our trip had been ruined by our experience.Hotel.com say its the hotels's fault and they have our money which HAS NOT YET BEEN refunded nearly three weeks after the incident! To sum it up : THIS HOTEL IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL BUT UNTRUSTWORTHY and brings this website's recommendations into disrepute. Be warned that if you book this hotel through this site you too may end up in our predicament, having to pay for a room that you are unable to stay in and with weeks of trouble trying to reclaim the money in vain. "
hotel palace heights ,"Excellent Value I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. It was difficult for my taxi driver to find the hotel, and from the outside it doesn't look that great, but the rooms inside are great, with a modern and clean decor, flat panel TV, and a lovely bathroom. They're not huge rooms, but they're very comfortable. The location is perfectly central, there are loads of shops, restaurants, and ATMs when you step out of the hotel. All the staff, from reception to housekeeping, are very courteous and helpful. The food in the restaurant, Zaffran, is wonderful, and the service in there is also exemplary. There is also complimentary water, fruit and internet, and a welcome juice. I would rate this as higher than a 3 star. Also, just a note -- I ate all the fresh fruit provided in the room and got more when i finished. It was good to eat fruit that i could trust. "
hotel palace heights ,"Nice Place for tourists/night stay. I visited Delhi as a tourist with my spouse and young kids. I didn't want to pay a very high price just for the few nights stay in a typical 5 star hotels, so I chose this hotel based on other reviews. All we needed a night stay in a safe, clean and comfortable place. Although little higher on the price side for what it offers (not very big, but ok size rooms). Location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate. Most site seeing locations are closer to this place and central park, Metro station is right there. Restaurant is also fabulous. Overall very nice experience and would recommend with high ratings. Free wireless Internet service. For vehicles, Parking on the streets, free of charge but not very difficult to find. "
hotel palace heights ,"very comfortable and excellent restaurant The Hotel is very central. The room we had was clean and we were able to sleep 3 in the room. it is an expensive hotel, but worth it for the restaurant and its central position. The staff were extremely helpful, even to the extent of accompnaying us to find an ATM which worked. "
hotel palace heights ,"Excellent Good Value Down Town Hotel Great location right in the heart of Connaught Place and close to the metro station. (Beware though, that because the hotel is quite small and with no street frontage to speak of, taxi drivers may not know where it is).The two best things about this hotel were the restaurant - great at both breakfast and dinner (some of the best food I've ever had in India) - and the enthusiasm of the staff and their willingness to help with everything.Rooms are well appointed and confortable. althougha bit on the small side. The AC can be a bit aggressive and in our room we were forced to turning it off during the night so as to avoid being too cold. However, that's a minor niggle.Internet worked fine and was reasonably fast.The only negative aspect was that having booked another couple of nights for the following week, we were informed the evening before we left that they were unable to honour these extra nights. Had I not gone to the desk to book a taxi for the following morning, I suspect that I wouldn't have found this out until too late.Good value for Delhi. Overall, recommended. "
hotel palace heights ,"Clean modern hotel We stayed for 3 nights in late June and then for one night in early July on our way back home. The hotel was modern and very clean. The AC worked very well and it was a good escape from the very hot temps outside. Rooms were on the small side and there isn't much of a lobby, so if you wanted to sit around/linger this isn't really the place to do that. Our first room faced an interior air shaft/courtyard but the second one faced a side street. Staff was friendly and helpful and we met the owner one night who was also very pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast is included and there were both western (eggs, pancakes) options and Indian options. There isn't much to see in Connaught Place, but there are many restaurants in walking distance. It was strange to walk out on our first night for dinner and be one of the few people in the street in what is considered the center of town. The hotel arranged a car to pick us up at the hotel and the driver (Bobby) was nice but tried to sell us on his tour guide services the entire ride to the hotel. He even tried to take us to his office BEFORE dropping us off at the hotel, but we politely declined saying that after such a long trip we just wanted to get to the hotel and shower/sleep. This worked and he took us to the hotel. Because he was so friendly and seemed like a good guide we hired him to drive us around on a tour of Delhi a couple of days later and he barely spoke throughout the entire day that we spent with him. It seems he used all of his Delhi facts to get us to book with him and once we did he didn't have much more to say. His company seems to work exclusively with Hotel Palace Heights, so beware when booking tours through the hotel. He was nice and honest, but didn't offer much in way of a tour. Overall, the hotel experience was a good one. If what you're looking for is a modern, clean and safe hotel in the &quot;center&quot; of Delhi, then you can't go wrong with Hotel Palace Heights. "
hotel palace heights ,"perfect service I stayed end of august (29.08.09) in this hotel in Delhi - and it was simply perfect!!! You can't ask for a nicer, welcoming service. Everybody from the staff was very friendly and tried to help in every way - from access to internet, to phoning at the agency where I've had booked an ac-cab for a sight seeing tour that didn't show up. The receptionist made it come in less than 5 minutes 8after I've waited half an hour in vain). M. Wasim at the reception desk was extremely kind, and also his colleague who was on duty after his shift.I only can recommend this hotel. Connaught place is in the very heart of Delhi, the rooms are comfortable, have European standard, what a pleasure to find a nice and clean bathroom after a travel through the Himalayas. a welcome drink (juice, of course it's India after all) was offered as well as a fruit basket. It was simply perfect. "
hotel palace heights ,"Definitively my favorite place in Norther India! I stayed in India three weeks visiting Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Mumbay. I spent two nights at Palace Heights at the beginning of my trip and two at the end. The staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and efficient, making you feeling at home (if not even better!). The service is professional, discrete and very efficient. They arrange perfect tours and transfers from/to the airport. The hotel is a quiet oasis in the heart of Delhi, with clean rooms furnished in a contemporary design style. The restaurant is one of the best I tried in India, cozy and relaxing. You buy a five star quality hotel at the price of a three star! A modern and confortable hotel with a strong personality! "
hotel palace heights ,"Expensive/Annoying for the price We could hear incessant banging in the first TWO rooms they put us in. After finally getting settled into a quiet room, we put on the do not disturb sign, but people kept calling and knocking on the door to give us things like cookies - nice, but annoying. They also pressured us into using their travel agent for a tour to the Taj Mahal. The car and driver was over priced and had barely working A/C. The driver didn't really talk to us (for the 2 hour there and 3 hour back drive) and kept making us go places to buy stuff (we didn't but he stopped anyway). The car didn't have seat belts. The staff at the hotel also told us differing info on how much things were going to cost and Monday through Friday the electricity goes on and off every so often. "
hotel palace heights ,"Nice but expensive hotel We stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height. The hotel is expensive for the size of the room &amp; bathroom we had. The view from the hotel room is not great.. On our first night we had no hot water, but the hotel staff fixed that problem very quickly. However the hotel staff are courteous and provided a good service.If you are in Delhi for a couple of days and want to be in a good location to the attraction, this hotel will be fine. "
hotel palace heights ,"Excellent service I've stayed at this hotel a number of times so far - always for business - and the one thing that stands out is the customer service, and he staff's desire to please.The hotel is small, but very well kept, and clean. The wireless internet used to be problem, but they have fixed it. The food in Zaffran is excellent... the breakfast is to order, and always prepared very well. They cater to a lot of foreign tourists.The location of the hotel is superb. Right above the Metro station which makes traveling around Delhi a breeze. Its also in the heart of Connaught Place (CP) with plenty of options in shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and great to walk around in the evenings when traffic is a lighter.I've always had a pleasant experience at the hotel, and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, safe, and good place to stay. It is a little pricey, and I think would be better valued at about $25-30 below its current rates. "
hotel palace heights ,"take your chances We stayed here on two separate occassions. We landed in Delhi and stayed the night before leaving elsewhere. Our first night was awesome. The room was small, but adequate. It was nicely decorated and clean. No complaints. When we returned a few days later it was a different story. Our room was even smaller than the first night. We were given dirty towels and bed sheets. The walls were scuffed and dirty. The thermostat control was so filthy it was black. When we complained, the staff apologized,but that was about it. It was hard to believe this was the same hotel.It wasn't cheap either. We paid $183.00 Cdn through Expedia, not good value for the money. We paid for a hotel transfer and didn't get one, nor did we get a refund. The outside of the hotel looks very rough, but once inside it is nicely decorated. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Zaffron offers great value for the money. The food and service was one of the best we had in India. "
hotel palace heights ,"A good staritng point The service here was excellent, particularly in the restaurant. The rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower. Rooms are a bit small with no view, but are kept very clean, with clean linen every day. Complimentary fruit, water and snacks are provided It was relatively expensive compared to the rest of India, but worth it for Delhi. Breakfast is included with the rate and has a good choice and a decent buffet. The food in the restaurant was one of the best Indian restaurants we visited and very good value "
hotel palace heights ,"Good hotel conveniently located on Connaught Place Well located on Connaught Place and for getting a tuk tuk to the varying sites of Delhi. The hotel is better than an 'average 3*' rating but not good enough for a ' very good 4*' rating. The service was good and the rooms are clean, if a little on the small side. However, if you are only in Delhi for a day and a night (which we were) then it does exactly what you want. The restaurant (attached to the hotel) called Zaffran was very good. "
hotel palace heights ,"Excellent and well priced hotel right in the thick of it! This was the third hotel we stayed in during our to-ing and fro-ing to Delhi. It was the cheapest (£98 per room per night inc breakfast), the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lot!The staff were great and very helpful. The room was lovely, clean and well equipped. Best of all was the restaurant and the central position. The breakfast was excellent and we ate at the restaurant too on our last night in India, which was reasonably priced and one of the best meals we had during our trip. The location couldn't be better - walk out of the door and you're right in the middle of the intensity that is Connaught place! But inside it's calm and a haven. If you've only got a few nights in Delhi - stay here. "
hotel palace heights ,"Perfect Boutique Hotel If you are lookin for a hotel in Delhi which is centrally located, affordable, convinient then Palace Heights is the place to stay. The hotel is located on the inner circle of connaught place and is on the second floor. The approach kind of looks deceptive but once you enter the premises i bet you are heading for a good experience. Its a small property having 15-18 rooms only. There is a restaurant called Zafran which serves great Indian food and is also a popular among the locals. Complimentry morning breakfast is served here too. Being a small property you can be assured of personalised service. The staff right from the doorman at the entrance to the hotel manager are friendly and ever welcoming. The rooms are small but cant expect anything grand at that price (rs.6000 - 7000) in that part of the city. The room decor is modern and the bathrooms are done up well too. Its a great place for tourists who are lookin out for affordable accomodation, central location, not looking for aminities just wanting to sleep the night in good rooms eat good breakfat and get out to spend the day. Applies for business travellers as well. "
hotel palace heights ,"An individual hotel with personal service We stayed for two nights at the palace heights and would definately recommend it. The room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect, if a little small. The location is great for getting a feel for Dehli although I would warn you not to stray too far off the beaten track but this goes for everywhere in Dehli. The restaurant is excellent at a reasonable price. I know we could have eaten cheaper but for under ten pounds for more than the two of us could eat seemed a good deal to us especially as it was so good. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would go back again, in fact we did go back to the restaurant on our last night in India having unfortunately booked another hotel which wasn't nearly as good. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great in all respects The well located Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis . The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out . They are well deocrated and all the things that you would expect from a good hotel have been considered such as good room service , wireless and various complimentary touches . The staff are exceptional and the service was excellent and attentive in all respects .The restaurant is also great and serves fanatastic food from North India , once again the service was great and the restaurant manager was particularly helpful in recommending dishes .Highly recommended "
hotel palace heights ,"Fantastic hotel in a central location The hotel is small but great, in a very central location in Delhi. The rooms were fantastic, I can't fault anything wrong with the rooms. The hotel restaurant was also great - I highly recommend it. "
hotel palace heights ,"Don't judge a book by it's cover Arriving at Connaught Place, Delhi is an experience in itself. Oh my goodness, the driving is like nothing on earth I have ever seen before. Cars, people, bicycles, tuk-tuks and anything goes.From outside the hotel looks small and unassuming but once inside its cool air-conditioned loveliness all your travel stresses disappear. The Reception staff are very helpful and their english is excellent. We had arrived in India with only 3 of our 21 nights with a hotel booking, the hotel staff recommended a travel agent - Perfect Holidays, and a very helpful man, Javid organised the next 8 nights for us including internal flights, accommodation and a driver.The room was a little on the small side but very clean as was the bathroom with all the usual trimmings - extra loo roll, shower cap etc.The hotel is in a great location, smack bang in the middle of the shopping area and close to the underground Palika market. Breakfast in the Restaurant was lovely - choice of indian, continental or english. This was one of the better hotels we stayed in on our trip. "
hotel palace heights ,"Fab fab fab fab!!! This was my second stay at palace heights, and it was just as great as the first one! This is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at, everytime you visit delhi. They have an excellent restaurant attached, and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food, this is truly authentic. Their room service is even more fab, with meals reaching in 10mins! The rooms althou small are immaculately maintained and any troubles you may have are dealt with immediately. The staff, right from their manager to the various service attendants are so polite, its ridiculous. I have stayed at various hotels all over India and none have been this wonderful an experience. Literally, one can make no complaints. Its the perfect Boutique hotel. Only thing missing is possibly a spa, just to wrap the deal!Will definitely keep staying at Palace heights, everytime I do visit Delhi. "
hotel palace heights ,"Highly recommended - comfortable rooms with modern flair good food! Situated on Connaucht Place. Spacious bedroom and bathroom. Furnishings all-round elegant and in very good condition. Amenities: Airconditioning functioned well, safe, upon arrival complementary fruit basket (1 apple, 1 orange, 2 bananas, 2 chocolate biscuits) and daily two large bottles of water, facilities to make tea or coffee, free daily newspaper. We like Indian food as authentic as possible, i.e. spicy and hot. Hotel Restaurant Zaffran satisfied both criteria. In fact, the food was absolutely delicious, delicately spiced, and not too hot. Two main dishes plus two portions of Naan bread and a bottle of water average cost between 775 and 900 Rupee. Although the breakfast buffet was rather simple, the food was good. The usual cereals, two kinds of fruit, bread, butter, jam and honey. Orders for eggs, bacon/sausages/ham, toast, coffee or tee are taken by a waiter. The coffee was absolutely fantastic! Each cup prepared separately with freshly ground coffee beans. The hotel &amp; restaurant staff was competent, very friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great service location breakfast and value for money! We only booked a day room at the Palace Heights at the end of our trip after arriving by sleeper train at 9:15 am and before flying home that night, but we would have no hesitation in using it for our entire stay in Delhi on our next visit. We had a smooth and speedy check-in, and being ravenous, as we had not eaten on the train that morning, went straight into breakfast which was delicious, especially the pancakes and capuccino! Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, with a kettle and tea/coffee, the shower gave ample hot water and there were lovely toiletries. The hotel is on the first floor (there is a lift) which means the rooms are quiet, and its location on Connaught Square is excellent - we loved the great bookshop 2 blocks away. Best of all, however is the service: from the doorman downstairs who loaded our luggage into the lift and whisked us up to reception, to the smiling receptionist and waiters in the restaurant - nothing was too much trouble, and every member of staff was eager to please. I can highly recommend the Palace Heights as great value for money. "
hotel palace heights ,"The Best Ever ! Will be back for more I'm so glad that I had chance to stay in Palace Heights.I was traveling alone to Delhi for architecture conference. I'm a woman and Delhi's first timer.I did my 'research' on tripadvisor and decided to choose 3 hotels for my stays: Ginger Hotel, Hans Hotel and Palace Heights.I had a good hunch with Palace Heights, since my first email conversation with their general manager, Mr. Joseph. He responded to my email and made me sure that my reservation is secured. Palace Heights is such a high demand hotel among travelers and I can see why during my stay.I loved the building and its settings. Palace Heights is an example of successful adaptive re-used building. The location is just perfect, in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia.I loved the hotel room - minimalist, simple and very clean. I loved the window which facing to CP and you can witness the bustling busy experience downstairs. And the goof thing is the room is very quite - you can't hear anything from outside.But the thing I loved more is the superb service and warm greetings ! From receptionist to restaurant, from housekeeper to general manager! They are doing their best to help me and make sure my stay is incredible. And they did.I'm really impressed when I asked their help whether I can print my essays for my presentation at the conference. They don't have business center. So what they did was, they take me to hotel's main office, which located couple blocks from the hotel. And they insist to take me by hotel's car. After I print everything, the car drove me back to hotel.The porter always accompanied me when I want to take a tuk tuk and made sure that the driver know where I want to go and bargain the price for me. And for the bonus - they have a free wifi !I'm so blessed with all kindness I accepted during my stay and I will be back for more Palace heights experience. "
hotel palace heights ,"High Standards at a reasonable price Arrived from London, our pick up (arranged through the hotel) was waiting for us. The hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi, a short walk from shops and parks and the Metro is very close by. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are very clean and modern. The restaurant is excellent. The only negative points were: 1. We specifically booked twin beds (travelling with my daughter) and when we arrived this was not available. The first night they found us another room, on the second (a week later) they provided a Collapsible bed but this was quite uncomfortable. Unfortunately the same problem occurred wherever we stayed during the trip. 2. The second minor problem was the surging shower with fluctuating water temperature (not extreme so merely annoying). "
hotel palace heights ,"A great respite from the bustle of New Delhi The location is fantastic, the Palace Heights give you an oasis of calm right in the middle of Connaught Place.The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, with good recommendations for restaurants in the area, since no matter how the the hotel restaurant is (and it it good) -- you can't eat there every night.The included fruits, water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily with no hassle.I had also arranged airport pickup through the hotel and everything went very smoothly: driver was there on time, very professional etc.. "
hotel palace heights ,"A Haven of Peace My husband and I stayed at the Palace Heights at the start of our Indian holiday in November. We had arranged an airport pick up with them which sadly wasn't there when we landed. We called the hotel who immediately got a driver to us so we were not really delayed. On arrival (given that this was 6 in the morning) they got us a welcome drink and told us our room would be ready in 20 minutes. This was a real bonus as it meant we could have a sleep before hitting Delhi.Throughout our stay the staff were really helpful. Changing money for smaller notes, booking cars etc.Each day we had complimentary water and fresh fruit. The hotel was a real haven away from the bustle of Connaught Place and the food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent. "
hotel palace heights ,"Good location tidy and professional staff We stayed at the hotel various nights in December 2008 and used the hotel as our hub for a number of trips throughout India.The hotel has been renovated recently and now offers business-style, clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom (the best one we had during our trip, always enjoyed coming back there ...).From the hotel, you have easy acces to various shops (incl. Western shops with sometimes attractive proces) at Connaught Place, restuarants included. From the hotel its only a few meters to the new subway, that brings you e.g. directly to the railway stations for hardly any money. We used it several times and always enjoyed the ride.The hotel staff is professional and also takes take of the guest's needs. We used both airport pick-ups and drop-offs.The restaurant at the hotel offers very good food, the elevated prices (compared to other options outside the hotel) are worth it and the staff is great and friendly.There might be cheaper place to stay in Delhi, but Palace Heights benefits from its central location, professional staff and proper rooms. We'd go back there if we return to Delhi. "
hotel palace heights ,"Fantastic! Stayed at the hotel for a business trip, the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful. Will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi! Highly recommended. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great Stay We stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the US. We went ahead and arranged for transport to the hotel (RS. 800) to avoid having to deal with prepaid taxis upon arrival. The hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport. Check-in was smooth and though our room was a bit small, it was very comfortable. We were provided with complementary fruit and bottled water daily. I especially appreciated how quiet it got at night. We had a minor issue with the hot water but it was rectified very quickly. Breakfast in the hotel was good and very convenient. We had dinner at Bukhara at the Maurya. The food was fabulous!The hotel arranged for a day tour of Delhi using their car and also for early morning transport to the Delhi railway station. Although we found the tariff to be a little overpriced, we would definitely stay here again for the amenities and the convenience. "
hotel palace heights ,"An affordable gem Recently, I was looking for a centrally located, hotel in Delhi, which was not $300/ night! Happened to go through the reviews on your website and came across Hotel Palace Heights in Connuaght Place that seemed to fit in my budget, and scheme of things – both in terms of location and just the general feel. I was able to easily make my bookings through emails that were promptly answered and all doubts were clarified. From the moment I entered to the time I checked out (4 days), I knew I had made the right choice and had found really good hotel in Delhi. A place that I would like to come back to and recommend to others. The rooms were very clean and done in a very fashionable style, but most importantly comfortable to stay in. Some hotels take fashion to an extreme and make it uncomfortable But this place seems to have struck the right balance. The in-house restaurant was an absolute treat. Seems to be a very popular choice as there was a long waiting even on weekdays. The hotel was very courteous to keep tables for hotel guests on hold and never made us wait for a table. Plus a special discount for hotel guests in the restaurant. Also the room service was very efficient and even at 3 am in the morning the food was served with a smile. The Internet was truly, wireless and truly unlimited with no snags or hidden costs. In India, many a places advertise about their wireless but it really is pathetic. Initially, I had some technical difficulty getting on to their wireless on my MAC, but the front office guy came and solved everything within no time. A suggestion to the hotel: it really is a nice place, though they do have a long list of wines, cocktails and all kinds of alcohols being served; available in the rooms and in the restaurant. A small watering hole that one can go to after a long day of work in the city will go a long way in making me feel even more at home. Wink wink. "
hotel palace heights ,"Definately a good place to stay Service is the best After reading the revieiws, we booked the hotel. I was hoping for a clean place, and they defnately met that requirement. The room we had was a bit small as others had pointed out, but it was clean, well equipped, comfortable, and right in the middle of the city, close to most everything.The real standout was the service at the hotel. They carried our bags, arranged for transportation, had excellent room service, and met any extra request we had. One of our travelers in the groups was sick. They went out and got her medication we requested, made special meals for her, and kept an eye on her when we went out exploring the city. I couldn't have asked for anything more for my little sister when she was sick.Definately eat in the hotel's restaurant. It is great food. I was really worried when we arrived, because from the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall and I would never have booked it, but it is completely different from the inside. Don't let the outside picture worry you.Because it is located in the heart of the city (Connaught Place), it is a bit expensive, but you are paying for the location. It is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area when we were looking. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great choice in this price range. The Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range. The location, rooms, service are great and the restaurant is fantastic. The staff were especially helpful and welcoming. Highly recommended. "
hotel palace heights ,"It's ok - but come for the food Good points:- No noise from street- Central location- Cheap / good value- Good facilities in room (plasma TV, large bathroom, minibar)- EXCELLENT restaurant with 24 hour room service. Come here like the locals to eat fantastic North Indian food- Very reliable airport transfers, cars were right on time- Helpful staff who rectified issues immediately (see below)Bad points: - Noise from other people's rooms, slamming doors, voices in the corridor etc- Bed sheets and towels were dirty when I arrived - but this was quickly rectified - Surfaces also dirty - reception didn't apologise but immediately sent a cleaner - Expensive minibar - but what do you expect! - The sink drain was very smelly and some flies congregated around itIt's a good choice but expect some noise from other guests, and question the reception if you don't feel things are that clean. "
hotel palace heights ,"Friendly I've booked this hotel via Desiya an Indian website and got a good price. I was a bit concerned as I was going over with my small fella and the wife. It has been a wonderful experience - breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious! As my wife was indisposed for 3 days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals. I had my Beer &amp; dinner all days at the hotel and the service was attentive - they served good mughalai dishes! My son had Rice &amp; Dal Makhni all the time which he call Brown Sauce!! As mentioned already the TV is good as all rooms had independent SKY receivers for entertainment. This is a very well located hotel for shopping trips to Pallika Bazaar and short distance away from Ghafaar market, thoroughly enjoyed the walking until I got dehydrated?!!! Very clean place which has recently been redecorated - recommended. "
hotel palace heights ,"Clean Modern cozy central While travelling to India I booked through the internet this hotel.There were not many pictures and not much information but reviews seemed to be good enough so I took the risk. It was well worth it. This small hotel in the centre of New Delhi, is not only close to everything but may be the the best choice for an affordable yet clean and beautiful stay. It was recently renovated and although the rooms are small, it has good service, it is clean and quiet (unlike the rest of India). has aircondition (but no heating.. even though the temperature on January is quite low.). I definitely reccomend it as a safe, cheap, and clean choice. "
hotel palace heights ,"Fantastic! A true gem. Hotel Palace Heights is a superb boutique hotel in the heart of Delhi. Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer. Spotless rooms and central location, the hotel's Saffron Restaurant is also a treat.Staying there was truly heaven. Our thanks to the wonderful staff who made our stay in Delhi memorable. "
hotel palace heights ,"Clean great staff - a little gem While a lot less ostentatious and pricey than the big international hotels in ND, this little place really deserves its high rating.Stayed here for a few days arriving in India, and then again one night before shipping back to Europe. The staff is extraordinarily friendly, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities (plasma TV every room with international news channels for those of us that still like to stay in touch). While located smack in the middle of Connaught Place with plenty of restaurants around, the hotel restaurant is also worth a visit. Well priced and delicate food, looked after and managed by a very helpful manager and really nice staff.The only drawback is the lack of pool / SPA. For that, you have to go to the bigger hotels in the outskirts of town (well, so so) so its up to you if you want to make that trade off. All in all, a place we can warmly recommend! "
hotel palace heights ,"Clean safe and comfortable hotel in Dehli! Arrived in New Delhi and our transfer was waiting, as promised. Check-in was easy and the staff were great. The room was modern, but small and the view was less than spectacular. If you plan to be in Delhi for a short stay and will be on the go most of the time, this place is great. If you are planning to spend nights in, it could feel a bit tight. That said, everything else was amazing. The room itself is has a flat screen TV, snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge. Room service is great and it's offered 24 hours a day. The linens were very nice and very clean. The pillows were lovely. The bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling marble, the shower was large and there was a good supply of hot water. I think the power may have been an issue once, but not bad. The towels were clean and all the toiletries offered were nice. The complimentary breakfast was huge! For the low price this is a winner, clean, great service and a central location make this hotel hard to beat! "
hotel palace heights ,"comfortable stay I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; had both the dinners here. The hotel is a contemporary one with all the style, elegance &amp; modern amenities. The food in the restaurant- Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds. "
hotel palace heights ,"Stay away for the love of God We just completed a 5 days stay at the hotel. two days prior to our arrival we asked for airport pickup. That didn't happen, and not much of an apology was provided.We arrive at the hotel. and it takes them 30 minutes to check us in, even though we are the only ones there. Funny thing about that, the hotel claim to have 40 rooms, actually they only have 15. and the lies continue. They also claim to have free internet access. what they mean is, if you have a good internet subscription for your phone, it will also work within their hotel. They still tried to convince me they actually did have a wireless network, I said show me, then they said, they don't know how, and they can't call anyone.The room is so small, you feel clostrophobic. And the aircondition only has icy cold or really hot. The &quot;fancy&quot; flatscreen is the oldest LCD samsung available, and the picture quality is awful. All the furniture is cheap plastic.Someone below has mentioned they give complementary fruits, water and cookies. but don't eat the cookies, otherwise, you don't get any new ones, and if you don't eat the fruit, they just leave it. see the tasty picture of the moldy fruit. and even the bottled water is expired. are you kidding me.The building, is a completely delapidated building, doesn't matchwebsite pictures.the &quot;wonderful restaurant and breakfast&quot; that someone mentioned. There are two fruits cut last night, some cereal, and then you can order and omelet or pancakes. Don't do the last, it gave us a little brown present for two days - if you know what I mean.Location: connaught place is really dirty, shopping is very good, but you just feel disgusted with the dirt and flies. If you are Indian, no problem, but if you are white, there are 1000 conmen ready to approach you in a very aggresive way. Our Indian friend also advised us not to go outside after 7. yes, I said 7.Now to the masterpiece. The reception. They are 20 years old, and have the combined intelligence of a 10 year old. They cannot answer any questions, like airport question, shopping question, internet question, etc etc. When we were checking out, the boy spent 30 minutes counting the minibar, and when we went back to the room, he actually checked one more time before we could leave, just to make sure we didn't take a 40 Rupee cola. keep in mind we just spent 32500 rupees for the room.All in All, do yourself a big favour. Do not budget travel in Delhi. We have been to a few hotels in India, and this one takes the price. WOW. "
hotel palace heights ,"fine for a short stay Arrived at this hotel located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connaught Place just before midnight and the staff were expecting us. The room is clean, functional and 'modern', with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture, decorations and bathroom. Linen was spotless and towels plentiful, and there were chocolate biscuits for an evening snack along with complimentary bottled water. But the room felt small, and if there was any more than one of you it would not be somewhere you could relax at the end of a long day's sightseeing or really get comfortable if you just wanted a 'day off'. There’s something a bit clinical and cold about the décor. We stayed there in transit (arrived midnight, departed 0700 the next morning) and it was fine, as it would be if you were on business and in meetings all day. Breakfast was included in the room rate and you can have it either in the restaurant or delivered to your room (no extra charge). The breakfast was fine without being memorable. The hotel gets an 'above average' rating because it was clean, the staff helpful, and the cost spot-on. "
hotel palace heights ,"very nice hotel We stayed 4 nights in this nice hotel very welll located, clean , staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran In a previous review one person mention that the only bad thing he could say was that the towel were old, well they replace it for new one The beds are very confortable . They give you every day 2 bottles of water and fruits , newspaper in the morning and on arrival they serve you juice. We tried near the hotel the Zen restaurant which was very good , it is about 5 minutes by walk from the hotel on your right side when you get out of the hotel. Do not be surprise but when you arrive the building do not announce what is inside the hotel is on the seconf floor of an old buiding, the hotel was renovated 1 year ago. It is not expensive for New Delhi do not hesitate to book . "
hotel palace heights ,"Great Just great. Very well located in Connaught Place, great rooms, nice furnished and modern decoration, flat screen tv, nice bathrooms, nice restaurant, very friendly staff, affordable... Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back. "
hotel palace heights ,"Very good hotel I went to India on April the 3rd and stay at Palace Heights for 2 days after going to Jaipur, and stayed there in the last night in India on April the 10th. This is a very nice hotel, good rooms, not very large but OK, with LCD TV and they offer each day mineral water and a fruit basket. The bathroom was very good too.The dinner and breakfast room was nice, and the staff very friendly. And I must say this is an hotel in the center of Delhi, near the Indian and international shops. I recommend this hotel. "
hotel palace heights ,"Cute little hotel Very small room. The staff were friendly and helpful . It's very good for the price and location and running around in Delhi.The restaraunt, Zaffron, is the best thing about this hotel. The menu is great and the prices are about $15 per meal.I recommend this hotel when you are in Delhi. "
hotel palace heights ,"Refreshingly good...a must stay on your visit to Delhi Location: at the heart of the city. you can never ask for a better location. This is considered to be the finest location in New Delhi.Rooms, Staff, Service, Reception: ExcellentBreakfast: Complimentry and excellent choice of menu.Very good decor and so peaceful. "
hotel palace heights ,"A Hidden Gem Excellent management &amp; staff:-This place has an unassuming front and is fairly new. Small with 14 rooms, but excellently managed. Well staffed and no pressure to tip whatsoever. Your every wish is their command and they make you feel special. Asked for hair dryer, iron, extra towels etc. and all supplied within minutes. Forgot to switch off the &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; outside the door on one occasion. Hence found rooms not made on return in evening. Called reception. No problem. Room made up in 10 minutes. Seldom does one see such service.No queues for check-in or check out as there are only 14 rooms.24 hour room service @ no extra charge. Safe deposit &amp; Minibar Good air con / heating .Thick fabric window blinds keep the blazing sunlight out and let you have a late morning sleep.Plasma TV on wallComfortable super king size bed with nice pillowsLarge interior illuminated wardrobe with plenty of space. 2 full length dressing mirrors on wall .Complimentary breakfast - cereal, fruit juice,egg, bacon, sausage, toast, Indian poori with potato masala. Egg served many ways. Try the masala omlette which is like a spanish omlette &amp; is lovely. Coffee expresso, cappucino or simply black.Free newspaper and a call for breakfast before they close at 10.30am (in case you forget)!Toilet:Extremely clean &amp; shiny toilet with a brilliant shower. Plenty of hot water. Shampoo, body lotion and soaps all provided. This the only hotel toilet I have ever seen where the mirrors do not get misted after a shower, thanks to the excellent ventilator fan, which also removes any odours instantly. Plenty of thick clean towels.Airport pick up by hotel worked well.Restaurant:Checked in at 12pm after a late flight and although it was closing time for the attached Zaffiran restaurant, they still let me order from the menu! Their food is very good . Tandoori chicken cooked to perfection. Also try their lamb dish (cant remember the name) which is a whole leg of lamb prepared with exquisite spices. The hyderabadi mutton biriyani is also recommended. Plenty of locals eat here. For $25 2 people can have a three course meal! Nice decor and ambience as well.And all this for GBP $150 per night in Connaught place. What more can you ask for? Interestingly, when I tried to book rooms via trip advisor, all the booking agents said &quot;room not available&quot; and offered rooms at other places, but when I emailed the hotel directly, they had vacancies!On the other hand if you want window views and gardens, look elsewhere, but for the price, this place cant be beaten.Certainly recommended and will stay here again.Good management always counts! "
hotel palace heights ,"Did not honor reservation agreement I shared a room with two friends. The manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit. On arrival they told us we will only have the room for three nights. Different people manning the hotel reception gave conflicting reasons why this is so. However their reasons were not convincing as from the booking screen on their computer we noticed that two other guest were booked into our reservation. Furthermore the manager that agreed on our six night reservation is nowhere to be found even by his own staff. They tried to move us to another related hotel that is out of the city center which we refuse to due to their prior breech of trust. We were in Delhi for a conference and had to skip part of it to look for another hotel. This was extremely disruptive. The impression I have is the hotel tries to get you there before moving you to a less popular co-owned hotel due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;. I recommend not using this hotel for important business since they do not honor their reservation agreements unless you do not mind finding another hotel at the last minute. Apart from this, the rooms are well furnished as expected for the price that they charge, and service is prompt. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great Choice for One Night Overall, this was a fine place to stay for one night; however, no one met us on arrival at IGIA to take us to the hotel, even though we had previously booked the transfer and re-confirmed prior to arrival. Not the best way to start off our stay. The hotel claims someone was there, and we just didn't see him. We waited for 45 minutes, then decided that no one was coming. There were TONS of drivers with signs waiting, just not for us. We took a pre-paid taxi, which was easy and reasonable, but taxi drivers don't seem to know where this hotel is. If they can get you to Connaught Place (which they DO know), just stop someone on the street and ask for the hotel, telling them that it's located behind the Odeon Cinema (there is more than one cinema in Connaught, though). The hotel is very small and unassuming, somewhat difficult to spot from the street (it's on the second/upper floor above storefronts). There is an entry door on the ground level, which was well-lit and staffed by a security guard and two other employees (e.g., bellman and restaurant maitre 'd, I think). There is a lift to the second floor. The lobby area is tiny (just the front desk and two chairs), off which is the Zaffron restaurant (attractive, well-staffed, but we only had drinks so I can't comment on the food). Our room was tiny as well, just enough room to walk around the perimeter of the bed. The bathroom was a decent size, with standing shower and Western toilet. Some basic toiletries were provided. Hairdryer upon request. The room was very modern and pleasant-looking, with a comfy bed, suede throw pillows, and flat-screen TV. Complimentary wi-fi access in the rooms worked perfectly. Two bottles of complimentary water were provided, along with chocolates and a fruit plate (we did not get to sample the included breakfast due to an early departure), welcome drinks upon arrival. The hotel was able to change money for us; there was no ATM machine visible nearby. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again; it's a great value (approximately $150 USD for a double room) once you find the location. "
hotel palace heights ,"Excellent hotel stayed 1 night, extremely helpful staff, clean modern room, good restaurant, a sanctuary in the middle of delhi, very near excellent metro system stationi have only positives to say about this hotel "

hotel palace heights ,good central hotel This is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhiIts in a central location and the staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or anotherIt was clean and comfortable but the towels were old and grey!When i started looking for a hotel in delhi it was really difficult to find one that wasn't either really expensive or that looked dirtyThis was neither even though it was more expensive than any other hotels i stayed in in india but it was definitely worth it 
hotel palace heights ,"Wonderful Boutique Hotel The Hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi.The service overall is outstanding. Full of nice touches - complimentary fruit bowl &amp; chocolates on arrival - the best hotel soaps &amp; lotions I have ever used - and very good breakfast with courteous &amp; professional staff. The rooms *are* small (as is the hotel - no large foyer or bars you enter via lift) so I would not book for an extended stay - but they are as modern and stylish as you will find anywhere, for a weekend or overnight you couldn't ask for more. I booked direct via email - and though I had change my original booking to 1 night (from 2) in email this was not acknowledged - so ensure you are clear from the outset. But I was not penalised so all went well. I'm in debt to the fellow reviewers on this website - I would not have found or chosen it without your help - so I am glad to add my voice to chorus of approval - my only regret is not staying in Delhi for longer ! "
hotel palace heights ,"Pleasantly surprised When I first started searching the net for a Delhi hotel I was horrified at the cost of accommodation. We definitely wanted to stay in or close to Connaught Place because it is so central and position is very important . I realised I would have to pay a bit more than usual but searched for medium hotels. The Palace Heights looked ok and the photos on the hotel website were good. It said that the hotel had recently been re-furbished. I realise now that this refurbishment is in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Took the plunge and booked. My husband and I were travellling with another couple and none of us were strangers to India, so we were prepared for disappointment. Arrived at the airport and took a pre-paid taxi. Remember to have the printed full address on hand to show the driver. Connaught Place is divided into sections and it's important for the driver to have the full address. We arrived and took the lift to reception. Looked allright, clean and modern. Yes, they were expecting us (relief) and we were shown to our rooms. Airconditioned, modern and clean with flat screen television on the wall. The bathroom was compact, marble and clean. There was no view from the window but yes, the hotel passed our test. We ate at the restaurant and it was excellent. It was packed with locals which is always a huge recommendation. We stayed three nights and had no complaints. Then we left our heavy luggage there while we travelled in Rajasthan for a week. We returned for a final night, luggage was safe and sound, restaurant still great, the staff always obliging. Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was ordered from the menu - nothing flash but certainly good. This is a good hotel and certainly fits the bill for those not wanting to pay 5 star Delhi prices but wanting pleasant surroundings, cleanliness and a safe place to rest and of course position. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great Hotel in the heart of New Delhi Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi is a great hotel. We stayed there on two seperate occasions during our trip to India and were pleased with both experiences. The hotel has been renovated relatively recently. The rooms are very modern and sleek, and most importantly, clean. The room we got on our first night in Delhi was small, but comfortable. The bathroom was clean and new, and the water hot. On our second time around, the room was bigger, which was nice, and equally clean and comfortable. It seems in Delhi that there are few options in the mid-range budget - everything is either ridiculously expensive and luxurious, or ridiculously cheap and disgusting. Hotel Palace Heights is right in the middle in terms of price and a wonderful bargain. It is in the heart of Connaught Place, too, which is an excellent location. The attached restaurant, Zaffran, is delicious. The food is safe and clean and really excellent. The service matches the food and decor. Like many places in India, the menu shows no liquor or beer, but it is available, which you will no doubt be glad to know after any amount of time in India. The staff were kind and helpful. Highly recommended. "
hotel palace heights ,"Heaven after Hell! We stayed here for 1 night on the 13th December after 2 nights at the Hotel Ajanta (see seperate review).This hotel is in Connaught Place, section D. We booked with the hotel after turning up with our suitcase! I was trying to work out where to stay in the taxi from the Ajanta Hotel, it was that bad! This hotel worked out at approx £80 bed &amp; breakfast for the two of us.Room was small but had everything you needed, reminded me of a Marriott hotel back home. Bathroom was lovely, water was either very hot or cold but hey a small price considering where we had just come from! Plasma TV on wall, coffee &amp; tea facilities. They also gave us fresh orange juice and a fresh fruit platter - nice touch! Breakfast was freshly cooked. This area is very western with KFC, Macdonalds, TGI Friday's etc but we ate at a restaurant next door from our hotel called The Embassy - nice food but be aware as not only do they add a service charge they also add 'output VAT'. I would recommend anyone to stay here but as it's a little bit expensive it would probably be ok for the 1 night. "
hotel palace heights ,"A pleasant place to stay in New Delhi My girlfriend and I stayed one night at Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi on 27/11/07. Having spent most of our holiday in India (Rajasthan) in budget accommodation, we decided to spend a bit more to just chill out for our last night in India.Our double room cost 5500Rs + 12.5% tax including breakfast. The room was excellent - comfortable, extremely clean, a nice ambience (the staff said the hotel had been refurbished around February this year). There were some nice touches like complimentary welcoming drinks (apple juice) and later a fruit platter during our stay. Service at the hotel was reasonable without being fabulous. Reliable hot water but in our room it was very difficult to find a comfortable temperature (ie. temp was either very hot or cold).Because we didn't really spend much of our holiday in similar accommodation, I am unsure whether this price is reasonable or comparable to other hotels in New Delhi. The only thing I could compare it to is Hotel Jukaso Inn (Connaught Place), recommended by Lonely Planet, which we booked online in a last minute rush for our first night in India, for which we foolishly paid 3850Rs + tax for a double room - it was terrible (dirty, small)... completely different to Hotel Palace Heights, which is literally a few doors away. "
hotel palace heights ,"Great hotel great location Hotel Palace Heights is a great hotel in a great situation in Delhi.The staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing. The room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views. The bed was very comfy.We ate lightly in their restaurant on our last night in India the food was good and I felt that we should have taken advantage of this earlier in our stay.Although our room was small, I felt that the Hotel Palace Heights is aspiring to great things. "
hotel palace heights ,"Lovely small hotel This is a very small and charming hotel situated very centrally in the buzz of Connaught Place, about 45 mins drive from the airport. It has been very recently refurbished to a high standard with modern and tasteful decor. The staff were very friendly, courteous and attentive throughout my 2 night stay. The room was not particularly large, but had a big bed, flat screen tv, and immaculate marble bathroom with large shower. There is no view to speak of, but that didn't bother me. The restaurant is also excellent, serving very tasty and good value Indian food in pleasant surroundings, with a good choice for breakfast (not buffet). I found it very difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in Delhi which looked any good, and did not want to stay in the big chain hotels. This hotel fitted the bill perfectly - I can thoroughly recommend it to anyone. "
hotel palace heights ,Excellent hotel Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location. Close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city. Rooms are clean and everything works.

hotel palace heights ,Absoluter Geheimtipp 
hotel pearl plaza ,Very friendly staff; Convenient Location Stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi. The hotel arranged car service to/from the int'l airport and to/from the Taj Mahal the next morning. I definitely recommend this hotel as a stress-free way of traveling around and into/out of Delhi - they took care of everything and were happy to assist. 
hotel pearl plaza ,"Wonderful service clean rooms and well connected with local drivers This place is perfect if you are interested in keeping the costs down, while also enjoying a clean and safe room. The frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests, and they arranged drivers, and guides who took us to the Taj M. as well as to and from both the airport and the train station. The wokers at the hotel even gave us early morning warm Nescafe mocha drinks. If I ever make it back to Delhi I would for sure stay at the Hotel Pearl Plaza. "
hotel pearl plaza ,"Great hotel - Clean My boyfriend, two friends, and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Prior to our trip I was emailing with a number of hotels in this neighborhood near the train station. Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive. In advance he arranged for:--A car to pick us up at the airport at 2am when our flight arrived--A car, driver, and guide for a day trip to Agra--2 Clean hotel rooms with plenty of bottled water We had a great experience. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The prices for the hotel and all the additional services they arranged for us were also very reasonable. Happy travels! "
hotel pearl plaza ,"Nice place reality of India will hit you in this neighbourhood We stayed at this hotel a few times. The rooms are OK. The linens are not spotless, definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotels/hostals (unless you go to upscale places), so bring your own if you wish. Also if you use the AC, there is no blanket and it gets pretty cold. I had my sleeping bad. The first time we stayed the AC worked the whole time and the room was freezing. The next time, the AC was turned off through the main switch downstairs so it got stuffy and hot. Complain and ask for a discount if this happens. Everything is negotiable in India!Rickshaws and taxis are easily accessible, the staff will even fetch you one if needed. Friendly, safe, hot water, good price.Located in Paharganj, metro station (Rama Krishna) is 2min walk, plenty of dirt and beggars, so if your first time and day in India, be prepared to be shocked. New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than 40-50 rupees. Nizamuddin is farther away. "
hotel pearl plaza ,"Clean hotel reasonable prices We stayed at Pearl Plaza in Paharganj, Delhi for 2 nights in the middle of May 2009. We got lost in Paharganj (which is a big market) on our way there on the first day, but on the second day we had no problems finding it anymore, even at night.Here is a summary of our impressions from the Pearl Plaza.positive:- email communication with the hotel was very fast (we made a reservation in advance. In Delhi making a reservation in advance is strongly reccomended, as there are not so many good hotels and prices are quite high)- very good price for double AC room (no breakfast, but breakfast could be booked extra for 80 Rs. p.P.) - 1100 Rs including taxes.- reasonable price for airport pick up - 600 Rs for AC car. The Airport is quite far away from the city (ca 30min drive). Prepaid taxis from the eirport are cheaper, however.- friendly staff- nice, modern furniture- warm water- comfortable beds- clean linen- laundry and dry- cleaners' service which was quite cheap (15Rs. p. piece of clothing) and returns the laundry on the same day- free tea around the clock- TV and fridge- a lot of restaurants, internet cafes and shopping possibilities all around.negative:- no internet- many rooms have no windows- ACs temperature is being controlled centrally, by the reception staff. Thatswhy our room was quite cold when the AC was on. We even could not switch it off ourselves.- no wardrobe in the room "
hotel pearl plaza ,buona sistemazione e buon prezzo 
hotel perfect ,"Awful Hotel I was travelling with a group of friends and we decided to stay at this place. Big mistake. We booked far in advance, but they managed to book us one room to few. When we argued with them and showed them various emails that proved booking, they said that we had not asked for enough rooms and that it was our fault. At first they told us that some of us would have to stay elsewhere, but in they end they finally relented and found us another room. The staff were rude and pushy, barging into our rooms at odd times of the day and evening. Also, we had to wait for about an hour at the front desk whilst they checked various booking details - they seemed determined to find a reason not to let us stay. The rooms were dirty, pokey and noisy. "
hotel perfect ,"Ok if you're not expecting too much This place is ok but don't expect it to be perfect. Location is good. It's quite close to the metro and it's very close to a nice shopping street. It's a bit in a building area so when we first arrived in the middle of the night it kind of scared me out. In the daylight it was a bit better though. Rooms are ok, make sure you have one with windows, the ones at the back are the most quiet. Place is quite clean (for Delhi-standards), didn't see any bugs at least. Rooftop restaurant is nice, they serve food that's quite ok, breakfast is ok too. "
hotel perfect ,"don't stay here Not a good place to stay! We were there as part of a Gecko's tour. The room was dirty, the bathtub was stained and they use moth balls in the sinks which end up smelling up the entire room. Service was really weird. We were two women travelling together which may explain the &quot;extra&quot; attention we received. The bus boys would knock on our door for various &quot;reasons&quot; and when we opened the door they would attempt to push their way into the room, I had to start standing in front of the door to prevent this. There was also a knock on the door at 9:30pm (we didn't answer) which was not followed up by a call from the front desk so who knows what they wanted! There are much nicer neighbourhoods in Delhi - don't stay here! "
hotel perfect ,"Not a bad place to stay... After reading previous reviews of this property I was a little bit sceptical about how comfortable my stay would be. I stayed at the hotel twice during my first trip to India and found it to be good. The location is good, close to a lot of shopping and the metro station and restaurants are not far away if you ask the hotel staff. The staff were extremely helpful, the porters and reception staff were able to help us with any of our questions and booked taxis for us. As for the rooms, they were clean and comfortable. Yes, there is a wet bathroom - which is common in any part of Asia. We also ordered room service and the food was prompt, fresh and tasty - the porters always rang the doorbell and waited for us to answer the door. It is a standard budget hotel in India and it was better than I expected - especially after reading other postings. "
hotel perfect ,"Not a good place to stay The hotel was booked by a travel agent and for the price they charged (I have stayed at much better hotels for the price I paid here), I expected much much better. The floor was dirty, bathrooms were wet..i was disgusted. Dont know about food and restarant quality as I decided not to eat there after I saw the rooms. Also the area is very noisy and crowded. I have attached some pics I took... "
hotel perfect ,"Far from Perfect but not that bad Really not as bad as previous reviews suggest in my opinion. The exterior doesn't bode well and it is definitely budget but we found the staff delightful and helpful. Room was OK, not dirty. It had TV, fridge and large bathroom. Did not use the restaurant so can't comment on it. However do not use this hotel if you are looking for luxury!! "
hotel perfect ,"Cheap place Rasika15/02/2008Sri Lanka,This hotel is not so good, but it's a good budget hotel. Staff is not so friendly, but supportive. Room boys don't speak English, we had a bad time with them due to lack of communication. Food was not up to our expectations, but ok ( since this is a budget hotel). Rooms were clean &amp; tidy enough. Bathroom was clean &amp; ok.You can find a PIZZA HUT &amp; a MACDONALDS little far , but working distance from the hotel.Also if you like to have Indian food there is a good clean restaurant very close to the hotel and there is a big night market too. Also you can find lot of money changers near by the hotel. Roads are really busy &amp; noisy. So considering all these I think, a person cant expect something more than this from a budget hotel. I would like to recomond this hotel for travelers who look for cheep hotels. Remember to bring bottled water along with you...... "
hotel perfect ,"Dirty hotel By far the worse hotel I've ever seen.Been to India a lot and for half of the money they charge, you can get much better.Don't go to this hotel people they will try to rip you off after you've seen how dirty and cheap the rooms are.They have one suite and they put these photos on the net.Absolute misguidance.When I stayed there I called my travel agent immediatly to find me a different hotel. "
hotel perfect ,"Strange Strang, strange hotel. Far from perfect..Booked by a travel agent through this tour we did. By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We ate in the restaurant once. We were alone. The waiter took our order, dissapeared for about 45 minutes and returned with the food to stand the other side of the restaurant and stare at us eating. Another waiter also stood and watched us and also took photos of us with his mobile phone.We ordered room service from then on. Still they don't knock, just come into the room, close the door behind them.. I know the culture is different but the hotel only seems to get Australian, American and British guests and they should know that we find this extremely rude.The area was absoloutely awful. We couldn't even find somewhere to buy a bottle of water. We felt very scared, always being followed, and were not happy here at all. "
hotel prince international ,"no complaints It was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staffs. we will definitely stay in this Hotel Prince International again. "
hotel prince international ,"Don't bother! Decided to try this place after reading the two previous positive reviews which I am suspicious of their origin as our experience was not great. Our lift (arranged by the hotel) was not there when we came out of the airport at 1.00am. No prob got a taxi to the hotel which was all dark with people sleeping in the reception area on arrival and one snoring very loudly in the back room(so much so that I thought they were digging the road up). That was ok until we went to our room which smelt like a sewer and was right next to the noisy lift shaft which kept going all night. Our bed was damp which in Feb is not great as it is cold. After about 6 hours in our room we couldn't wait to leave at 8.00am so went down to reception, still staff all asleep in reception area so we picked our way over them and outside where it is dead no rickshaws anywhere. Nobody moves around here until 10am. Someone from the hotel came out and told us to come back in and call us a taxi to the train station as we needed to book tickets to get out of Delhi asap. After half hour of wasting our time finally a man arrives who turns out to be a travel agent, he then spent the next 2 hours trying to terrorise us into hiring a driver for $800US for 4 days! He took us to the back entrance of the train station to make it look as bad as possible, (we later found the front entrance which was fine) and then convinced us we would be better booking our tickets with him (just a lure to get you into the office then the hardsell starts!). When we finally realised we were being done over we decided to leave and they proceeded to try and intimidate us about 2 women using the rickshaws etc etc. We left and had a bit of hassle with the rickshaw drivers but just got out if they wouldn't take us where we wanted to go and eventually we got to the train station about 12pm! Got our tickets in 10 minutes and went straight back to the hotel and checked out and moved over near the train station. This hotel is not in a great location as advertised, it is totally dead and not really Karol Bargh it gives a bad impression of Karol Bargh area. Wouldn't like your chances if you need to get to the Train station early in the morning. You are at the mercy of this hotel once you arrive so be careful. The night staff were pleasant when they woke up and nobody was rude to us but they tried to take advantage of us and our room was rubbish so would not recommend for 900rupees including tax, 500 would be a fairer price compared to what we found. Especially if you can get a room that doesn't smell and is dry and not near the lift. "
hotel prince international ,"Truly a great place Comfortable, well priced, and very clean. Nice staff, and a good internet connection. They even pickup from the airport. Would stay here again. "
hotel prince international ,"A Real Bargain in Delhi This was my first time in India so I really didn't know quite what to expect. When my taxi pulled up in front of the hotel at 3:00 am I was exhausted and more than a little unsure of myself. As soon as I stepped inside the lobby, the staff's attitudes immediately put me at ease. While the hotel is very close to the Karol Bagh Market, it was surprisingly quiet and close to several nice restaurants like Alpha Spice, Raffles (great thali) and Crossroads and about 5 minutes away from a Metro station.. My room was clean and had hot and cold running water. Room service was very quick and the food basic and good. All in all I would heartily recommend Hotel Prince International "
hotel prince polonia ,"I thought the Prince Polonia was an excellent hotel for the money I stayed at the hotel on two ends of a trip to Nepal and India in August to early September. I found the staff to be most accomodating and helpful. Ok, some were obviously looking for tips but were in no way pushy about it. I was surprised at how good the breakfast was and I was even offered to have it delivered to my room. I found the room clean and comfortable and, as a single woman traveler, felt very safe there. I have stayed at various grades of hotels all over Delhi and plan to stay there on my next trip. Its location off the main street meant it wasn't as noisy as some. And I had a room right on the street. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Not a Trust Worthy Service Provider Hi Guys, I am writing this negative review to buzz you in advance to think once to stay at this hotel. I visited their hotel and chosen super deluxe, I went to shop in Paharganj. When i back and saw that my expensive camera was lost. I asked the Manager to call the police but they denied to Call and miss behaved with me that i am putting false allegation. I lost the trust completely. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Not a great start to our trip On arrival in Delhi this really isn't where you want to head. The hotel itself is fairly grotty and basic. It's difficult to find decent budget accommodation in Delhi but I really recommend paying just a bit more and you'll find the quality greatly improves. We mainly chose it for the location near the station and the advertised pool. Both of which turned out to be extremely dirty and horrible. Didn't feel at all safe.We used the travel desk advertised to book our train journey onwards and a driver to take us to Agra for the day. After spending a few weeks in India it was obvious they ripped us off. The car we were taken in was very dirty, much like it's owner. The driver kept stopping the car and disappearing whilst leaving us with the windows down (was none to keen on switching on the a/c) for people to come and harass us with monkeys! They also added about £10 service charge for booking our train tickets for us. Unbelievably sly!!The restaurant on the roof was nothing special whilst the sprite I was served was evidently not sprite, nor anything of a a fizzy nature. We also never got out included breakfast.It really was the worst place we stayed during our trip. For budget accommodation it was not good value for money. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Great location rooms and food. Delhi is a hard place to find good accommodation but Prince Polonia held it's own for us. It is on a quiet street (quiet by India standards) but only seconds from all the hustle and bustle you need. The rooms are clean, large and quiet (worth paying a little extra for the deluxe, try room 401 on the roof top). We didn't use the pool but nice to have the option and the rooftop restaurant was surprisingly good, and a quiet retreat. No beer on sale, but I think they will let you buy it and drink it on the roof. The hotel arranged a pick up from the airport for us at 3am which was a relief. "
hotel prince polonia ,"A good choice for central Delhi The hotel is central and the staff are helpful. We used the onsite travel service to organise a car and driver for a weeks trip to Agra and Jaipur - very good service and excellent drvier. The room we had was OK only but the rooftop restaurant was a bonus. The street was not quiet when we stayed there so I'd pack earplugs just in case! Would I stay here again? Yes, there are many many places that are a lot worse! "
hotel prince polonia ,"Good location great rooftop restaurant We chose Hotel Prince Polonia for its close proximity to the New Delhi train station, its affordable rates and the good reviews it got from Lonely Planet authors and other travellers. The reviews were the decisive factor because the other hotels we were considering had multiple comments about travellers getting ripped off while checking out. We're happy to say that we did not have such problems at Hotel Prince Polonia. The only thing that bothered us was that they never returned our passports to our room as promised after obtaining the necessary information for their records.Rooms were simple and comfortable, which was great because we just wanted a quiet place to sleep without having to pay for all the frills of other western style hotels. We found that inside rooms were much more quiet than those facing the street. This was significant since the main road and market are just down the road and are busiest from 5pm to 9pm. Unfortunately, the lack of windows in the inside rooms deprives you from enjoying sunrise and sunsets.The two most useful features of the hotel for us were free internet access and the rooftop hotel. The rooftop hotel had Indian and continental dining options, good prices and courteous service. We always ate the Indian fare (which seemed to surprise our server at first and then just made him really happy to serve us), and it was in retrospect probably the best meals we had during our trip.One thing we did not like was that the guy at the front desk was not particularly pleasant. He seemed to respond reluctantly to our questions, but at least he was never rude.The taxi service was very convenient and the drivers themselves always friendly. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Mixed Bag Having stayed at the Prince Polonia on three seperate occasions in the last two years and in three seperate rooms I feel uniquely qualified to comment on the place.The first time we stayed there around 18 months ago we had a good stay. The rooms were clean, the location central, the majority of the staff helpful and the food palatable.Around a month ago we stayed and had a similar experience, although it has to be said that the manager (the son of the owner I believe) is a miserable git to the extreme and has a habit of speaking to his staff as though they are scum.At the end of our trip (about a week ago) we stayed again.We had seperate rooms this time because my partner wouldnt stop coughing. This time her room was terrible. It was very dirty and she found a cockroach running about. What's more there was large rodent poo in the bathroom sink and on the bathroom floor. When I phoned reception they sent someone up who cleared it up and then claimed that the rat wouldn't be back...hmm. I insisted that she get another room and after some grumbling and shouting from the boss to his staff she made the switch. My room by contrast was very nice and only about $8US more, had a big clean bathroom and good aircon and no rat poo or roaches.In conclusion, if you're going to stay here make sure you spend a little more and get a better room. Ignore the miserable manager who'll do his best to spoil your stay and instead talk to the nice older man (his father and owner?) and the younger guy in the travel agency in reception who are friendly and helpful and booked us train tickets over the phone from the UK.Oh, and don't guarantee that the pool will have water in it, it seems to change on a daily basis.PPS visit the little family run shop over the road the kids are the greatest salesmen and you'll walk away with stuff you didn't even know you wanted.... "
hotel prince polonia ,"Clean on a quiet street I made the reservation by email and called to confirm before I traveled. The staff was helpful, they let us check in early since the room was ready. It was a little pricy compared to the rest of the hotels in the area, but it was clean and on a relatively quiet street. It was great for our first two nights in India. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Don't believe the others. They Lied Twice I have traveled throughout India extensively and am use to the horrible hotel situation in Delhi. Upon seeing this hotel ranked so high on trip advisor I thought I'd give it a try. I booked two nights over a month apart. The first night on April 27, 2008 I arrived and they did not have the room I requested, even though I booked it a week in advance and had an e-mail confirmation I asked to see several other rooms but ended up having to take a lower grade room. Then they tried to charge me the more expensive rate. This first night the room was ok. Not the cleanest but for Delhi standards okay. The main problem came on my second night, June 1, 2008. This time it was me, my wife and three kids and my sister in law. We booked a triple room two weeks in advance. According to their website the room was supposed to have a balcony, bathtub, 1 king bed and 2 twin beds. When we arrived I ask to see the room first. They took me to a small room with only two beds and no bathtub. Needless to say I argued with the manager for almost an hours while by wife and three small kids all were just waiting in the lobby.. They eventually gave us a room with three bed and a balcony but still no bathtub. In all the 10 rooms they showed me there were not any with bathtubs. I don't think they have any. The room itself was not clean. Broken wall fixtures. Dirty bathrooms. There was even still trash in the bathroom from the previous occupant.. Piles of dirt and dust behind and under the bed didn't make me feel safe to let my young kids play and the gritty floor. We had booked three nights but decided to change hotels. The manager and staff were very rude to me and refused to come with me to look at their website that stated what I should have had. I even presented my e-mail communications with the manager stating what I had booked. Basically don't trust the hotel manager he lied to me several times. We switched to the Grand Godwin and so far it is great. I would not recommend this hotel and will never stay their again. "
hotel prince polonia ,"A good introduction to india This place was clean and the staff were helpful. Rooms are basic biut comfy with a tv and air con.we had organised a pick up from the airport after arriving in Delhi quite late, the staff on reception were great, getting us fresh water and food on arrival.we got locked out of the bathroom on the first morning, but they quickly got a handy chap in to fix that.The rooftop Restaurant is lovely, breakfast is included in the price and there is a choice of indian or continental. The hotel is located near to the main bazaar and the train station, you can get a rickshaw to connaught place - beware though they will take you to emporiums unless you give them an exact location.the travel person attached to the hotel was really helpful and arranged a trip to agra for us very quickly. free internet access is also a plus in this place. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Good one in a convenient area Had a super deluxe room, which was comfortable and quiet enough for a good sleep and it's pretty spacious. The staff were mostly helpful, except for one missing wake-up call, so as the attached travel agent. Could help book train ticket, which is much appreciated since it managed to get me one from Agra back to Delhi even the booking site I checked said it's full.A minor complaint is that the porter is constantly looking for 'help' so as to get tips. "
hotel prince polonia ,"Good value in Parharganj Delhi hotels are generally pretty expensive and Parharganj is about the cheapest area to stay in - it's also very handy for New Delhi railway station when you want to move on. My wife and I stayed here in December 2007 and paid 1390rps (about 35 USD) for a double AC room with shower room and balcony overlooking street. Breakfast included. They provided airport pickup for 500rps.Good clean room, friendly helpful staff, good rooftop restaurant. There are much cheaper plays to stay in Parharganj - but you'd have to be on a very tight budget or desperate to want to stay in some of them. "

hotel rak international ,"no complaints basic and clean this hotel was just fine, no problems, room was clean&amp; bright, staff were courteous. in hindsight, maybe a little expensive but it's a good idea to have somewhere like this booked before arriving in delhi "
hotel rak international ,"When you follow an Indian guy down an alley blame yourself. So, you’ve wandered into Paharganj, down Main Bazaar rd &amp; stepped off the main street into a small back-alley past a dozen hole-in-the-wall businesses selling hot curry-the-food &amp; the stomach bug, tobacco, toilet paper &amp; ‘bottle-water’ straight from the local tap &amp; found yourself here, or more precisely been led here by a guy from another hotel promising you the cure for cancer &amp; your very own private jet. Welcome to the Hotel RAK International.The young reception dude has a suspicious mustache, wears a buttoned shirt with the top 4 buttons undone, tight pants, sandals &amp; wears gold jewelry, yes I know, he obviously pulls the foreign girls no doubt probably works for his rich uncle, it’s the sort of place you remember when you regret things in your youth.We paid 550 rupees for a 2 bed room without air-con, fan &amp; hot water, we paid this much to avoid a few other rooms with more mould &amp; filth in the bathroom. Negotiating for a price is a must no matter how poor your skills are, just check out the bacteria &amp; germs we paid for…Yes, im not very good at it I know. Most of the rooms are of such quality in this hotel as well as most of Paharganj’s alternate budget accommodation, you are spoilt for choice for this type of humble dwelling so take your time choosing your rats nest, there are always plenty more available. Our 34cm TV at least worked &amp; didn’t blow up, our fan didn’t fall off the ceiling &amp; we didn’t ‘really’ require a mosquito net. Nor was the water green or brown &amp; there were definitely no ghosts in our room. We had to climb up 5 levels worth of stairs &amp; yes there was no elevator, this is a health warning to fat people to look elsewhere.The Hotel RAK International has a roof-top restaurant staffed by ethnic (Asiatic) Nepalese who answer to the cool reception dude with the moustache &amp; gold jewelry; you know they are paid in crumbs so tip well as they are cheerful &amp; friendly, unlike the reception staff who are friends with the mosquitoes there. However for a fraction of the restaurant price, I suggest you wander down Main Bazaar rd &amp; sample the foods that the locals come for such as fresh lassi &amp; fruit juice, samosa’s &amp; chicken kebabs.Don’t bother booking any taxis or motorized rickshaws with the hotel staff as they charge almost double the street rate, but if you did &amp; you stayed here to save money, I shake my head at you.The management here operate 2 more hotels of similar quality next door &amp; around the alley as well as a main one on Main Bazaar rd, they will promise you the world to shuffle you around once you agree on a price so they can keep the better rooms for those willing to pay the most. Remain calm &amp; try not to start any fist fights with management as us foreigners are clueless as to the true meaning of the side-ways head wobble which could mean anything from a simple yes, no, a combination of both or a coded signal to masked Indian ninjas waiting to jump you.Stay in Paharganj if you can hack it, it’s a seedy place full of shaddy Indians, hippies, wannabe hippies, ignorant holiday-makers &amp; true travelers. Bring a silk bed sheet to avoid the rashes &amp; old mattresses, bring an open mind, your travel guide &amp; enjoy India as it should be enjoyed the hard way. "
hotel rak international ,"Loved the Staffs I loved this hotel. it was perfect. nice room, cheap price, and especially the staffs. they were all very nice and very helpful. if i go back to new delhi, i will definetely stay in this hotel again. its just the best hotel for the backpackers and for everyone. "
hotel rak international ,"Good location for New Delhi station. We only saw one room since it was the last one available. The room was pleasant enough, although it was right next to reception and the front door, and thus noisy. Delhi is a noisy city, so always inspect a few rooms first. In this hotel the bathroom was dirty which prompted us to move down the road to Hotel Vivek (check the review!)The main reason you will end up on the Main bazaar in a hotel like this, is because it’s close to the New Delhi train station where you can catch the all important trains to Agra (to see the Taj Mahal) and Jaipur. Both trains leave early morning, and this hotel is literally minutes away from the station. Incidentally go straight to the international ticket office on the 1st floor to buy these tickets. It opens 8am-8pm (2pm on Sundays), and ignore the people that tell you it’s closed down/being renovated, and direct you to their friend’s/brother’s travel agent.Staff were friendly enough, and not that bothered when we told them we were moving out!We paid 750 rupees for a double room with A/C and en-suite bathroom. There was no breakfast included. "
hotel rak international ,"Budget but nice... stayed at hotel rak international twice recently whilst in delhi and liked it very much. it's basic as are most budget hotels in the area but i love paharganj and it's bussle, and my room was quiet and clean. hotel itself is nothing special and you're not allowed to have guests in your room, but think this makes for a peaceful stay which after a days walking around the madness of delhi is very welcome. "
hotel rak international ,El personal es muy gracioso 
hotel raunak international ,"Dirty cockroach infested room and terrible front desk service After spending much time selecting this hotel for our trip to Delhi, I would strongly advise anybody not to stay here. Our room was dirty, filled with coakroaches (woke up with one on my pillow), the front desk service was terrible, we were made to feel awful because we didn't book our driver through Rajasthan through Ranauk's travel desk and wouldn't let it go, it took forever to get simple things like clean towels, had not hot water and almost missed our train to Delhi because the man at the front desk forgot to provide us with a wake-up call (luckily, we had set our alarm) and instead of telling the driver to take us to the trainstation, the taxi driver tried to take us to the airport.Overall, the room was filthy and the front desk service was terrible. The only good thing about this hotel is it's proximity to the Metro...which makes for easy travel around Delhi...and a lovely breakfast included in the price. "
hotel raunak international ,Perfect Hotel I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife. A homely &amp; clean environment with prompt service was great. Staff was kind and helpful. People are friendly and helpful; the area is quite centrally located with easy transportations. We had a nice stay and sweet memories.

hotel raunak international ,Educated and Good Staff We stayed in two hotels in Delhi before picking up this hotel. Theworst about those hotels was the uneducated and useless staff. Here isthis hotel I found people with great knowledge. The Boss has travelledto 30 countries so far. Everybody was great.

hotel raunak international ,Best Hotel and Good Service I stayed at the Raunak hotel in new delhi The property is beautiful. The rooms are modern and sleek. The flat screen TV is great although they could have probably invested in some satellite TV to give us more channels. I mentioned this and they gave me extra with no charge. The lobby bar is very nice I really enjoyed this hotel If they get the internet situation sorted out I would definitely stay there again. 
hotel raunak international ,"as we wanted We are an old age couple and our third time to india. Hotel is good. Wi-fi, lobby and restaurant are few of the good things in the hotel. A construction site nearby was the only turn down. Orver all fine. "
hotel raunak international ,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone We were very disappointed with this hotel. I have stayed in Delhi three times before at better hotels for the same price. To begin we waited at the airport for over an hour to be picked up. I phoned twice and was told the driver was there. They did not tell that he was not in the airport but ouside in the parking area because they are not licienced and so can not wait inside. Then we were sold a very overpriced tour, as I found out later, again because we they are not a tour company or have no licience, we were told if there was an accident to get out and run. The car was not the best with bad tires etc. We we arrived back at the hotel the next night we were told we had to stay at a different hotel which actually was better, bigger room. The one in the Raunak International we could hardly get in. We went off touring India and when we got back we were told again we were in another hotel. This time we were not picked up at the airport at all and ended up getting a taxi. There was no late check out available, even though we had checked in late in the evening. The restaurant in the Raunak was fairly but at the other two hotels owned by the same man the food was dreadful.I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone. "
hotel raunak international ,“Worth Recommending” If you don’t want to spend more and want value for your money this hotel is worth staying. Best point is the location and informative staff 
hotel raunak international ,"“luxury at budget price” We booked the hotel dirctlily via email. They did not charge any money for advance booking, as decided and promised we were picked up from the airpot, the reception boy welcome us with a smile, we were give good room. The bed is really comfortable, matress are so soft and good. We had a nice sleep. Room is big and clean. Breakfast were served nicely ( I liked parta). There is a small travel desk here near restaurant which we approached to get information about city. We were impressed with there hospitality and booked our entire 1 month with them. It was an amazing holiday with a mix of train, bus and car. This review is to thank them for their services. I recommend to everybody who want great travel at normal price. "
hotel raunak international ,"“Comfortable Trip” We booked from malasiya directly with the hotel on our friend’s recommendation. We got a good rate. They sent a good taxi for pick up and same nice taxi to show us Agra and Jaipore. Rooms are clean, laundry is sparking white. Staff is polite and helpful. We had a comfortable trip in india becouse of them. "

hotel raunak international ,"Cheap Hotel Near New Delhi City Center We stayed Raunak International for four nights and it was our refuge from the busy streets of Kowloon. Despite being in a shopping, restaurant and pub area our room was cozy and quiet. We had a room on the back side and had no street noise. We found the staff to be very attentive and pleasant, always quick to open the door and greet our arrival and departure. The glass bathroom door is a bit odd but we were reading the newspaper and a real estate story profiled a luxury suite with all glass bathroom walls. May be its more common in Delhi than we think.The hotel is close to the New Delhi City Center to be an excellent base for our exploration "

Next day the hotel organized a trip to Taj Mahal, a symbol oflove. We were touched by the gesture. This hotel will always remainvery close to our heart. Special thanks to Mr.Singh. "
hotel raunak international ,"Awful Hotel On our recent visit to India we passed through Delhi 3 times and this was by far the worst hotel that we stayed in.... maybe even in the whole on India. It started with Check in. On arrival I noted reception staff telling guests that the metro was too far to walk to. This is incorrect it is 10 minutes. I assume this was a prelude to a sales pitch but am not sure. The whole check-in process took over 40 minutes. The reception staff was constantly interrupted, anwering the telephone, calling out to other staff, speaking to other guests etc and we were completely sidelined. Not what you need especially after a 16 hour train journey in. Finally we got to the room which smelt stale and sheets were dirty. My pillow case had dried food encusted into it. This was too much. My boyfriend complained to reception who said we would have to wait one hour to speak with the manager. This was not good enough and we decided to go directly to the managers office. In fairness the manager was kind and courteous and arranged to change our room and upgrade us. However I would say the upgrade was hardly worth the bother as the new room though bigger was also not clean. By this time we were beyond complaining further and ruining our time with arguements. The water was also never hot. If we had not prepaid in advance we wold have left the hotel. I really like the Karol Bagh area. There are hundreds of hotels here. One thing is for sure is that this one is not good value for money. They charge European prices with substandard quality and service. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. My advice is not to book in advance and have a good look around the area. "

hotel raunak international ,Comfortable journey in delhi We travel to Delhi several times in a year and generally we prefer to stay at the raunak hotel.

The staff is prompt and efficient and the rooms are comfortable and extremely well maintained 
hotel raunak international ,"Good value; terrible service (apart from the Manager) The hotel was ok, although no hot water and a shower glass panel sitting in the bath wasn't ideal. The manager was really helpful when we arrived and arranged train tickets for us for the very next day (the train station was closed) at an inflated price. The general customer service was very, very poor, firstly they didn't pick us up from the airport (although after much insistence they paid for our taxi fare), room service kept knocking on our door and rang us whilst we were sleeping to give us food/drink that we hadn't even ordered. The next morning the waiter in the restaurant became really aggressive with us as he kept trying to insist that we had to pay for our breakfast, even though it was complimentary. It appeared that none of the staff actually communicated with one another at all. I haven't stayed anywhere else in Delhi for a point of reference, so perhaps my review is harsh, but bad service is my pet hate I'm afraid. "

hotel raunak international ,"Never Never Consider this hotel even in your dreams... We were packed into a small car with our luggages but this was a free pick-up so we couldn't say anything.When we reached there our worst nightmare was about to begin....We went up to the room to see it first...There we saw the worst room..The bedsheet was an old and dirty one and the room was dusty.We started to say that we cannot stay in that room.They showed us another room which was equally bad.We called up our friend in Delhi and explained our situation.He told us to just leave the hotel immediately.When we went to the lobby,we explained that we can't stay in this type of place.We sitted in the lobby about half an hour waiting for our friend to come and pick us up.When we were about to leave,the receptionist asked us to pay RS 2000.We were taken aback as we stayed in the room for less than ten minutes.We just decided to ignore and leave.The receptionist called the mananger and he stopped us.He asked us to pay.We said that this is injustice.Instead the manager said that we were cheating him.The manager said that we cannot leave the place until i pay the RS 2000.The security guard blocked my friend's car from moving.WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO THE NEARBY RAUNAK PLAZA WHICH WAS THEIR HOTEL TOO.Luckily,the staff there were so much better and kind even though the room was just as bad.The staff understood us and made us feel comfortable.For RS 2000,THIS IS DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!!!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HOTEL,I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GINGER HOTEL AT RAIL YATRI NIWAS WHICH WAS SO MUCH INEXPENSIVE,NEWER,BETTER QUALITY AND SERVICE.THE RESTAURANT AT GINGER WAS SO CLEAN AND DELICIOUS FOOD AND THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE.SO,IF YOU ARE IN NEW DELHI,GO TO GINGER HOTEL INSTEAD OF RAUNAK HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

hotel raunak international ,"hotel from hell i email contact to stay with this hotel during 6-14 June with my partners as i look from the photos from the hotel website and it's look not so bad but the first day i arrived the hotel, it was nightmare! i wish i can show you a photo but i didn't take any photo from the hotel. the hotel stay in a seriously bad environment with construction, dusty and noise pollution. when i arrive the hotel, they got only 2 guests in the hotel and when i see the room. i was shock coz the hotel is actually under renovating and it's dusty everywhere! you can put your finger on counter or floor, they never clean it. the bedsheet got stain on it and it's really dirty. teh floor never wipe with water and it's dusty everywhere. they show me another room and it's still the same. they call house keeping to clean the room and the house keeping guy wipe the floor by using his legs drag the wet towel on floor! they doesn't have the view at all. when the guy try to open the curtain for me, the whole curtain fell down! i was really upset and tired and i tell the them that i can accept this and i want to move the hotel. they charge me 1 night for RS 1,800 even i didn't stay and it's all because of they try to fake people and lie to sell dirty hotel that under renovating in constraction area. they also charge me taxi pick up from airport for RS 550 which at the front of their website said 'provide free pick up from airport' and they charge us another RS 1,000 to get our from their hotel to somewhere else! i seriously upset and speechless from this hotel. i been travel many countries and never see anything like this before. it was nightmare and disgusting. you will never ever see anything worst than this. "
hotel raunak international ,"I feel cheated As other reviewers have said, the website photos are a lie. Our room was tiny and had no windows. I paid $55 a night for the &quot;executive room&quot; (a big discount of their published rates) and got what is worth more like $30/night in Delhi. The staff lied about our train tickets being confirmed then finally said there was no reservation possible so they could try to force us into renting their car tour to Agra. The price for local sightseeing is also apparently dependent on how much they think they can get out of you. Each staff member we asked had a different answer. Staff's English is poor. Several times during our stay there was no water and so the toilet wouldn't flush. The location of this hotel is OK, better atmosphere than Paharganj, but still lots of touts and insistent beggars. "
hotel raunak international ,Great Place I had a great time staying at this hotel. Started my travels through India with ease and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends! 
hotel raunak international ,home away from home Raunak became my home away from home. I was picked up at the airport as planned.Staff was very quick to get back to me on verifying airport pick up.

Very relaxed comfortable environment. Staff really extended themselves to make sure I had everything I needed. Comfortable clean beds too!

hotel raunak international ,"Exceptional service with friendly helpful staff...good place to return The hotel is located in Karol Bagh close to the Metro station (Rs.8 to Counaught Place, Rs.16 to Central Secretariat). The hotel is clean with friendly staff and an owner (Mr Singh) that really takes care of a personal interest in the needs of his guests. We met many fellow travellers from the USA, England, and other places in the world.For a budget hotel, the price is reasonable, the room we stayed in was clean with a shower and hot water (just let the reception know about an hour you get in the shower). The linen and towels are changed everyday when the room is cleaned. The staff are really helpful in everyway and all speak English very well (all with qualifications in Hotel Management). Karol Bagh is a good shopping location, busy day and night. We booked for 8 nights and Im glad we did. There is a McDonalds located on the main street and a Pizza hut down the same road...I would recommend Vishals (on the same road) if you cannot manage to bargain with the vendors!Tips:- Make sure you have lower denomination Rupees (Rs.10's, Rs.20's, Rs.100's) in your purse/wallet.- If you stay longer than 3 days in the hotel, buy the five litre water (Rs.50 with a Rs.15 deposit returned to you when you return the bottle). The fridge in the hotel cools it and often makes ice. Transfer this water into you litre water bottle...in the long run it works out cheaper. "
hotel raunak international ,"good hotel for indian standard According to the price we paid, the hotel was very good. At first, we booked a room in raunak plaza, which was near a construction site and very noise. The hotel manager offered us a new room at the raunak international hotel 2 streets further. The room was very nice, not small and clean. The hotel stuff was friendly and especially the managers assistant helped us a lot with booking travelling plans, shopping and other useful hints.The area is close to the center, with a metro station and lots of shops nearby. It doesn't look like areas in western cities, but it is a good place to stay in delhi "
hotel raunak international ,"The ideal place to relax after the journey. We felt like at home threre. The owner is very friendly and hospitable. We were pleseantly surprised when he offered us showers and a place to rest before going to the airoport ( we checked out few hours ago!). The hotel is located in a lively neighbourhood with a lot of good restaurants, markets and all a backpacker needs. The hotel has got the Internet hot spot! "
hotel raunak international ,"Good place to stay We stayed in this hotel for two days and this place is werth for the amount u paid. clean place, with all 3 star aminities. the food they served also good . the staff is friendly. nice place to stay, if we are going to delhi again we will definitely stay in this. GOOD PLACE. "
hotel raunak international ,"Avoid this hotel. The pictures you see on the web are misleading. They appear to be doctored by a computer. They failed to pick me up at the airport leaving me stranded after midnight. When I called them they claimed &quot;the car broke down on the way&quot;, which was a lie. The staff spoke very bad English and had great difficulty understanding me. Hot water was only available for a few hours in the morning and had to be requested (if they can understand you) at other times. Most of the electrical outlets in my room did not work. Their solution was to bring me a powerstrip to plug into the one working outlet. The exhaust fan didnt work in the bathroom and the armoire smelled of mold. There is no hotel safe, you must trust the staff with you valuables. The staff demands tips and will inflate the price. There is no true money exchange at the hotel. They were unable to make change for small bills. I couldn't get them to call me a taxi, instead they offered their &quot;hotel taxi&quot; for double the price of an ordinary taxi. I had to go walking and find a taxi on the street. The hotel is located in a dirty alley. Even the taxi drivers have trouble finding it. The area is full of beggars and touts. This is not a 3 star hotel. "

hotel regent continental ,"Go for the upgrade room My first trip to India. May not be my last, but my last to Delhi and Northern India. Stayed two nights. This hotel is ok. Friends made reservations. Had I known about upgrade rooms I would have insisted on one. Should have checked with them on what hotel they made reservations for. In the future in India - will insist on 4 star hotels. Have stayed in 3 stars in Europe and in Russia - but not the same. Would recommmend with explanation to get upgrade room. A friend did leave clothes in the room. When we came back a week later they had her clothes for her. So that was a plus. "
hotel regent continental ,"Regent Continental - OK for an overnight in Delhi Arrived at hotel late pm after 6 hour drive from Agra. Lobby clean and quite and impressive compared to surroundings and check in ok. Room average, air-con and TV worked but strong air freshener smell which turned out to be the insect repellent device in the bathroom, in fact there seemed to be a paraffin type smell in the corridors too. We went to the restaurant and looked at the a la carte menu but the maitre d' was very persistent that we and all other guests had the Indian buffet already prepared. We eventually acquiesced rather than chance Delhi at night as the area around the hotel was not too inviting. Turned out the buffet was expensive compared to the menu, I think we were misled. All well and went to bed. Breakfast was buffet style and ok too and there seemed to be a predominance of business people. Overall adequate for an overnight stay, and like most people you have to modify your thinking and expectations when staying in India on a 3 star basis.. "
hotel regent continental ,"be careful which room your given when we arrived we were given a room that resembled a dungeon. we complained and were assured that a better room would be given on our return 3 weeks later. it was better, but not much. make sure you see all type of rooms. silver is smaller but much better. service and food was very good however and location very good "

My stay in the above mentioned hotel was done by my travel agent as i wasnt very keen on spending too much money on stay.but off course i wanted a safe ,cosy ,confortable n economical place as i was accompanied with my partner.

It was a lovely experience n i would certainlly like to go n stay there if ever i go to delhi next time. "
hotel regent continental ,wonderfull experience I am staying in Bangalore. I would like to share the experience of my delhi stay which part of jaipur trip. We reached quite late night in Delhi. It was our first visit and we were in quite tension. Booked this hotel through internet. And to our pleasure we were received by the reception with a warm smile. Our rooms were already allotted. So had hassle free check in. Quite decent gold class room. Clean and tidy. But what impressed me the most was the room-service. We were served food as late as 2 a.m. and it was delicious. Thanks to Mr.mukherjee we were offered huge variety. we had to check out the next day for our trip to Jaipur. Loved the stay though. The staff did a commendable job to make our stay comfortable. Thank u all 
hotel regent continental ,Value for money...nice place to stay i visited this hotel in march 2009 as some of my colleagues were comming in from the US. Since their visit was only for 3 days and they wanted to do some shopping as well so i decided to put them in a hotel in the heart of the city.A friend of mine recomemded me this hotel in karol bagh called regent continental.On my instructions the hotel made arrangements to pick my guests from the airport.i booked 2 super delux rooms along with a full time cab for 3 days. In these 3 days i visited the hotel very often.By the end of the stay all my guests were very happy with the room service as well as the staff courtesy.When the bill came to me for clearance i was surprised to see such a descent price of everything.It was a nice experience with hotel regent continental. great going guys. 
hotel regent continental ,"really very poor value stayed here on our tour of northen india, by far the worst hotel.rooms were very small and dated. I don't know where the room photoswere taken but our rooms were nothing like those in the photos.service and food were very poor and breakfast was worrying as food was kept,well, warm. overall we were very disappionted with both rooms and location. "
hotel regent continental ,"Terrible experience at Regent Continental Noisy at all hours of day and night; in the middle of the night you could hear staff shouting and talking loudly and dogs barking incessantly outside.Room dirty, asked to change the room we were given cause the shower was filthy, second room wasn't much better.Dining room disgusting, dirty tables, dirty cloths, dirty cutlery. In the end they also claimed that we hadn't paid something (false) and receptionists started shouting and cursing against us and refused to give back passports until we paid what we wanted.Would never ever go back there!!! "
hotel regent continental ,"Disguting Hotel This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. Do not be fooled by the pictures on their web site the rooms do not look like that at all. The hotel is situated in a rundown, dirty and overcrowded area in what can only be described as virtually an alley way. Our room was too small to swing a cat in. The bed clothes were dirty. It was situated internally within the building so had no outside window. A small window overlooked a shaft reminiscent to a coal mine shaft. This was lit and hence lit our room at night. The bathroom was disguising, ancient and filthy. The towels were grey. The air-conditioning unit was so noisy you couldn't sleep. It also did not work and it must have been 30 degrees plus in our room. We complained to the front desk and they virtually ignored us saying they were full and there were no alternative rooms. It was only after my wife said she would sleep in the reception that they reluctantly took action. First they showed us an identical room and only after further complaints showed us to a so called VIP room. This was also disgusting but was larger and had a window to the outside world or should I say alleyway. The air conditioning also worked slightly better. What sums up the hotel was the employee running his fingers along the bed headboard and all surfaces to check they were clean. Of course they were not. There were also kids running up and down the corridors screaming all night. Apparently they also have student accommodation.This hotel had been booked for us by an Indian Agency who otherwise was very good. We have registered a complaint with them. Although we were supposed to stay two nights we moved out and paid for another hotel. We tried to get our money back at the reception and asked to see the manager. Needless to say he did not turn up. This may be India but I have stayed in many hotels in this country, some simple but always clean. This clearly is the worst my wife and I have seen. "
hotel regent continental ,Clean and well located The Hotel is well maintaines with clean hygenic rooms. Located in the centre of Karol Bagh close to the Delhi Metro station which makes moving about easier and fast. 
hotel regent continental ,"' We were impressed ' ! I travelled with my partner and daughter in March 2009.We toured Northern India during March and as we arrived in Delhi and stayed at theRegent Continental Hotel located in Karol Bagh area of the city. As we were travelling South eg Agra/Matura/Gwalior and Orchha and then returning to travel north to Mussourie in Himalayas , we used Regent Continental Hotel as transit base for our travels. We ended up staying 5 nights at the Hotel.Hotel offers three types rooms (Silver/Gold or Platinum). We were shown all types of rooms but we were allocated Platinum class room . (312 &amp;112).The room was spacious and accomodated 3 of us very easily. The furnshing was of avery high quality. The lighting was well co-ordinated and everything worked egAC, TV (satalite), Fridge, Safe etcThe room was very clean and room service provided was of 5* standard andComplementary bottles of Mineral water for guests and various free- bees were providedin Bathroom ,incase one forgets pack the basics eg tooth brush/paste;comb;shaving gear; shampoos etc. These were replaced each day!The hotel is located in a very narrow street in Karol Bagh area of Delhi. An area known forits its Shopping and maze of conjested lanes with 100s of small hotels .If one is travelling to India or Karol Bagh for the first time then the street leading toHotel will appear dirty, unpleasing and not so welcoming but once you get into theHotel you will be won over by the welcoming staff.! I do not mention names of individuals when I do a review but I was hightly impressedby 3 individuals . Those were Mr. Anshu Bhatia (Reservations Manager) for hisproffesional service and prompt responses to our requests, Mr. Shakhar Chandre Reception Manager for all his dealing with us eg unlocking the safe when we forgot our personal codes- safekeeping of our luggage in storage when travellinfg South to Northand finally Mr Yashdev Malhotra ( Room Services). It is worth contacting them if you have any problems.The Hotel in our view was of good value and it gives likes of YWCAs and YMCA International House in Delhi run for its money as it can be cheaper and room quality and service is much better! Hotel has an independent Tour and Travel organisers on site and it seems thatprices charged by them are bit expensive and one has to be careful and it is easier to shop around for best deals with other agents in Karol Bagh area. You will have no problem in finding one!The restaurant in the hotel is ok. The furnishing and lighting is pleasing but themenu can be improved. The breakfast is provided in a Buffet form and bothContinental and local dishes are available. The hotel restaurant is busy the mornings when large tour company clients are often staying there! The Karol Bagh area does have several eateries within walking distance from Hotel,Those of us who get fed up after some time with curries and one can walk down few street to MacDonalds or Pizza Hut for a respite .I have stayed in several hotels in Delhi during my travels and i think this is one of the better ones.It is a 3 * hotel with 5* service. Our experience was postive and we would definately stay there again and I would recommend it to friends/colleagues/fellow travellers! "
hotel regent continental ,"Average We arrived @ 10pm. our room was on the 1st floor. very bad ,smelling room.After complaining we were upgraded to the 2nd floor.Still not happy.The next day we were upgraded to a platium room.This was much better. However all the bathrooms are bad. Water pressure is low &amp; cold.We stayed there for 4 nights.Breakfast is not very nice.Staff dont speak English but helpful.Dont eat dinner in hotel.Will not go back "
hotel regent continental ,"Better than expected I stayed in this hotel with 2 colleagues for a week in September. I had read the reviews before hand and I was dreading the experience.We arrived after midnight and the neighbourhood was scattered with garbage and wandering cows. We had a voucher and after just signing the hotel book (no other formalities) we were shown to our rooms on 1st floor. We each had standard single room which appeared to have been remodelled not long ago. White marble floors, ceiling fan, two beds pushed together, desk with a tv, small sitting area and very loud AC stuck to the wall. The room looked nice but lacked finishing. The bathroom had a shower with no curtain and modern looking wash basin with too small fauset. No real amenities except a shower cap, 2 bars of soap and shampoo. Though the bathroom was &quot;new&quot; there were small gaps in the grouting and everything looked worn and done in haste.The bed was very hard but the pillows were new and soft as well as the pillow covers. Other linen were greyish and many times washed. No duvet but a woollen blanket.The room had a window facing inner courtyard and noises from other houses were heard quite easily. As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is quite noisy because of marble flooring in corridoors and distant phone ringing every night. There is gap under the room door so every sound can be heard inside the room. Also other guests vere talking loudly when returning in the middle of the night. The AC unit is very loud but it does cover other noises if you can stand the humming.Second night when returning to the hotel and turning the lights on cockroaches were running around. Same happenend couple of times during the week but the roaches were not disturbing and only a few. When talking to others the roaches were not seen in every room. There was lot of personel in the hotel and young boys cleaning the corridoors and carrying the luggage. And waiting for tips of course. The hotel has a desk where to hire a car for a day or for trips but be aware of high prices and be ready to bargain hard.Breakfast was not very good. Instant coffee, sometimes toast, red jam, couple of Indian dishes, omelets,sweetened mango juice if you were lucky. All the food was lukewarm so be quick to grab the hot omelets when brought in or the hot toast. Two bottles of water were supplied to the room every day and not charged extra.The hotel is situated in the middle of Karol Bagh market district which means little &quot;shops&quot; for locals, lot of garbage, noice and people. Beggars will spot you right on when you walk out of the hotel. Easiest way to move is to hire a car or get a tuk tuk to the city center or riksha to the Karol Bagh metro station. When raining the streets are filled with muddy holes and floating garbage. All in all not as bad as expected. "
hotel regent continental ,"Worst Hotel ... Beware Beware of Checking in this Hotel. Despite our Advance Payment, while checkin had to wait for 45 minutes just to complete Formalities. No room allotment planning despite 3 rooms were booked. Pathatic food, Water was leaking from cieling... in monsoon... Hostile and rought staff.... Despite feedback to the Hotel, no courtesy / approach towards improvement. Beware of cleanliness and services also. "
hotel regent continental ,"Stay at your own risk. I stayed at the Regent Contenental for 4 nights in January 2008. Even from the start, I should have known better. I arrived early and was pleased to be shown to my room right away. BUT when we got there, I was told by the clerk that there was no key for this room and they were busy trying to find it. I thought that was strange but was so tired from a long trip on the Indian trains that I just put my stuff down and tried to relax. 3 hours later I called the desk asking about the key. Nothing in the room would work with out the key. No power at all. No, no word on the key ....yet. I waited an additional 2 hours before calling the desk again and telling the clerk that I was NOT willing to wait any longer. I had not had anything to eat or drink since the day before and it was now after 5 pm. I could not even leave my room to go find food and drink and none was offered to me. Finally, they brought me a key. From the housekeeping people I think. It had no fob and was just a key, nothing else. Good enough.. And he finally told me that the previous customer had made off with the key and they were &quot;waiting for him to bring it or send it back&quot;. That night after finally getting some food and drink, I crawled into bed thinking that the noise would die down as the night wore on and I would get some badly needed sleep. Did not happen. The noise is almost unbelievable. All. Night. Long. The street noise is bad enough but the outer hallways and stairways are all stone and people yell up and down them all day and night. You can hear phones ringing constantly. The floors are so dirty that you have to wear shoes all the time. I finally found the room service menu stuffed in the bottom of the beside drawer and covered in big spots of mold. EWWW! Once I found out about room service, I did order tea and dinner. It was fine. No problems with that. On my second night I went to the hotel restaurant for dinner. I could not even get served. There was a buffet on so I grabbed a plate and some food. Never did get asked if I wanted so much as a glass of water. The next morning I thought about having a shower but there was no hot water. The tub was kinda dirty and the towels were a very deep grey so I guess it was a good thing I didn't . I had to call the desk yet again to get someone to come up and fix the hot water just so I could wash. I DO know how to operate hot water tanks in India and it was not working for me. The next day the toilet would NOT stop flushing so I called the desk again to ask someone to come up and fix it. You would have thought I was the worlds biggest pest! Imagine, to want hot water, a operating toilet and some food! I was always very careful to be polite. I did not show any disrespect for any of the staff. In desperation, I tried to get my reservation for the next two nights canceled but I had paid up front through Orbitz and could get nowhere with that so I decided to stick it out. It never got any better. I don't know if the staff were rude and ignorant to me because I was a woman traveling alone or if they were that way with everyone. When it came time to check out, the desk clerk (manager) tried to make me pay for another night, saying that I stayed one night longer than I had paid for. When I asked him to get the receipt I gave him when I checked in ( from Orbitz,) he claimed it had been lost. I had to go on the hotel travel desk internet right there and then and pull up a copy of the receipt from my email in order to prove that I had paid for the correct number of nights. The Regent Continential is definately the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I have pictures of the room and the view if anyone is interested. Stay at the White House or Wongdhen House in the Tibetan Village. A MUCH BETTER way to spend your Rupees. "
hotel regent continental ,"Dreadful not fit for my dog What a nasty hovel. The photos you see published in no way represent the squalor immiediately outside the front door or the mouldly noisy rooms you find inside. Staff either choose to speak no english or are just quite surly. The hardest thing to grasp is that when you ask a question they will lie to your face trying to get you in their cafe, shop, whatever. "
hotel regent continental ,"poor value dishonest staff crooked travel agents I booked this through a travel agent (Travel Zone, India) in Feb. 2007. It was noisy, dirty, and overpriced. Beware of the people at the tour desk. They are cheats as well. When I came back in August to Delhi, my new agent tried to book this place again for me telling me that my other choice (Clark International, 1 block away) was a far inferior choice. The agent's office is within blocks of both. I stayed at the Clark. It was great and cheaper. I know I will not deal with this agent again (Impact Holidays). I believe agents should be more interested in serving me ahead of the hotel!The Clark has since doubled their rates so next time I will try to find another place, but certainly not the Regent Continental. "
hotel regent continental ,"Bring earplugs! The hotel was horrendously noisy well past midnight till 1 am or later. From our room, we could hear incessantly the loud slamming of doors, the clatter of kitchenware being cleaned, hotel staff talking loudly, furniture being dragged across the marble floor. This made it quite impossible to sleep. We also encountered problems with the shower, whereby we could barely coax out a trickle of hot water. "
hotel regent continental ,"Regent CON-Dishonest Liers Complete misrepresentation Incompetent Theives!!! I would only recommend to STAY CLEAR AT ALL COSTS.The website claims they have 24hr internet, a money safe, tea and coffee maker, business conference centre???? When I asked the manager about these facilities he pointed over to a computer over 10 years old which the internet did not work on one day of our stay and said they're you go? he said that was the 24hr internet?The state of the rooms was DISGUSTING with dead mosquitos on the bed linen, floor, bathroom etc.The floor was dirty, un-hygenic, opposite to the photos.The room had a horrible smell, maybe from previous guests who did GOD knows what.The bathroom was Disgusting with Mold growing on each and every corner. the bathroom was enough to put you off your whole day.The water was cold majority of the time.They are so tight that when you leave your room, they go in and switch of the fridge and a/c, which means you can say bye to having a cold refreshing drink in your fridge after a long day of walking around, even after we said not to switch it off again, the next day they switched it off again.The staff are basically 14-16 year old boys who go around in groups of 2-4 who stand around waiting for tips.No one understands english, which I think is disgraceful considering the hotel is called Regent Continental, I would Rename it Regent CON as this is simply a very dishonest service and misrepresentation of services.Stay clea from the restaurant unless you want to have runs and stomach aches for days on end, I had only one dinner their and felt sik for days after, would highly recommend to stay clear.The a.c Units are aftermarket units which make so much noise and rattles that you would rather put up with the heat than the noise.The location of this hotel is in the most awaful place you can imagine, it is surrounded by gangs, beggers, loud barking dogs and general traffic horning outside from early hours to late.The only reason why I stayed for more than one night was that they threatened to charge a cancellation charge if i ammended the orginal booking.I booked and paid for the classic deluxe room which at the time of booking I was tgold that the main difference was that the classic deluxe rooms offered a view with balcony,hehehe, the balcony could not even squeeze one person on their without squeezing past to get the door closed, it was terrible, absolutely no point whatsover.They also claimed to have sky tv, yer when it works, and their are only like 20 channels,all indian ones, so good luck if you dont understand the lingo.In overview I would only recpommend to stay as far away from this hotel as poss, they are lots of hotels in the area which offer a higher standard of facilities, cleaner enviroment for half the price.I would sum up the Regent continental as being a farse, con, rip-off, dishonest, untrustworthy, disrespectful.I forgot to mention that the price they quoted me at the start was not the price they demanded when departing after a few days, they had added a 600 per night charge on and removed the 10% discount and said it was only available if discussed at the start, which it was??? At that point i was so fedup with them, i did not have the energy to argue anymore as they didnt understand anything I was saying, and just paid them and thought, well at least I know to stay clear for the future. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to experience what I experienced at Hotel Con, BE aware, stay clear at all costs! "
hotel regent continental ,"Low Average beware of the limitations I visited the hotel to meet someone who was there (I had also read the reviews posted here previously on the same hotel when I was looking for a place.)The Lobby Area looks empty. As indicated by another visitor on this site, they may advise visitors to take 'their&quot; taxi service. The Taxi Service is run by a separate unit (In the lobby) and the hotel staff do not coordinate with this unit in a satisfactory manner. i.e. telling the tourists to go and speak to them and totally disallowing responsibility for that aspect. I also noticed that their drivers may not Speak Any English too. (So make sure you check that before you get them for a hire). For anyone with a limited budget and looking for a budget hotel, this maybe ok, and the staff are helpful all right. Note that the area around the hotel can be a bit crowded. The area around (outside) the hotel is poorly illuminated. "
hotel regent continental ,"So so Its not a 3* for certain. Breakfast is a typical indian breakfast. we got food poisoning whilst here, but that could have been what we ate out..you never know! when we came ill the stafF were very helpful and friendly with great service. the rooms are spacious with airt con-but this is very noisey. in a decent location, very bustling! would not go again. "
hotel regent continental ,"Disgraceful!!! Checked in, stayed for an hour then checked out again. This hotel was worse than my dog kennel. Check in staff were rude. The whole reception area had an uncomfortable feel about it. The bathroom had no running water, there was scum, mould and anything else which was vile growing on the bath and tiles. The coridoors were dark and dingy. It was truely appaling. Sleep in a cardboard box on the street instead of staying here, it will be cleaner!!!!! "
hotel regent continental ,"BEWARE OF SCAM!!!! PLEASE, Anyone planning to book with this hotel should be very cautious. My family and I just returned from our trip to India, and this hotel is overbooking people and then transfering them to smaller, 0 star hotels in the vicinity (they have special arrangements with them). We were lied to by both the manager and the co-owner of the hotel and after two days of fighting, squabling and hell, we finally never got our room. They even promised to keep our suitcases and after our day out on the town, we'd return to our rooms......alas, nothing, they then said we're sorry but the hotel is full (second night in a row) - anyways, i could tell you all the details, but please just take my advice and avoid this hotel and its sleezy partners in the area (Perfect Hotel &amp; Crest Inn). If you'd like to have a chat with me about the experience, drop me a line at travel@astralize.com. Cheers, SameerLondon, UK. "
hotel regent continental ,"Good Value We stumbled across the hotel trying to look for a Travel Agents, we were introduced to a man called Muztapher at the Regent who arranges Flights, cars whatever you want, from that point our holiday started, we had an amazing trip. We had three nights here, the first night the room was dark with no windows and cramped.... but the second time we checked in we asked for a room with a window at the front, the room was much better, ask to see the room before you stay!!! Restaurant Ok, breakfast hectic, staff perfectly helpful if a little slow. rooms clean, fantastic location, Hotel shop a rip off, Muztipher made our trip, with good recomendation, obviously he is making money of tourists thats his job, but we didnt feel he was asking to much, he knows his stuff. We were two young women traveling together, if we needed to be walked anywhere he would send a chaperon with us, drivers were always good, cars mostly clean. The hotel was good value at about £20 a room. Would deffinately go back, felt very safe. "
hotel regent continental ,"It is what it is... My wife and I stayed here last month for 4 nights. The rooms are not great, the bathrooms are awful, but we spent minimal time in our room and only stayed in our room to sleep. There are much better options in New Delhi, however, they are way more expensive. I probably would not stay there again and it definately is not a 3 star hotel. "
hotel regent continental ,"not a 3-star hotel at all We had booked the hotel on recommendation by a Delhi travel agent against our will, as they told us it is in a super location and a good hotel where everybody they booked there has been satisfied. We have not been! We stayed there twice in tiny rooms with small windows opening to the next wall. You can not leave them open, as around there all outlefts from AC in other rooms. One room was in the reach of strolling cats. The rooms were dumpy, even with the AC on and had a bad smell. Room and bathroom were basic and not clean. The hotel had school children, a noisy clientele. The restaurant was rather expensive for what it offered. Room service was long and did spoil the content with opening bottle, without even thinking of cleaning it up. The location is not that good, in a unlit road, when you step our ot the door, you are &quot;attacked&quot; ba various people wanting something from you. We would never go back there again. "
hotel regent continental ,disappointing Overall we found the service and facilities of the hotel adequate. The big problem was the rooms. We stayed in this hotel twice during one trip to India and both rooms we found to be very dark (no windows) and small. The bathrooms very very dirty. We also had to share the one room with numerous cockroaches. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. 
hotel regent continental ,"incompetent staff I stayed here for 5 nights in early september. The location is average, hidden down a back alley but not too far from the excellent metro system. Whilst the communal areas were clean and well kept I found the room to be very spartan and it was only cleaned twice during my stay. The &quot;colour&quot; TV was particulary bad quality and virtually unwatchable.The room service was good, the wait was not too long and the food was of an acceptable standard, as was the price.However, my biggest gripe was the level of service provided by the staff. It took them 2 hours to finalise my bill when I came to check out and they then charged me more than I was originally quoted. (hint - if you can get a print of their original quote then take it with you. I didn't and was charged an extra £90 when I checked out).There is no money changing facility at the hotel but when I enquired one of the porters took me to a local money changer - who tried to short change me to the tune of 900rps.I also gave the staff a couple of postcards to put in the mail for me - 4 weeks later and they still havn't arrived! I doubt they got round to posting them..... "
hotel regent continental ,Disliked the Regent On arrival a staff member tried to downgrade us from a double regent suite to a classic deluxe room because they wanted to charge more for the suite even though we had agreed on a price. They showed us the classic room which had a cat living in it. We demanded the original room at the set price and they gave it to us without further quibble. Room service was awful as they brought things we didn't order and charged us for things we didn't order though management rectified this after complaining about it. The room itself was large and clean with hot water on tap and a television with good reception. Travel desk was very helpful and during our stay the hotel staff tried to be as helpful as possible and we didn't run into any problems paying them at the end. The taxi I arranged with the travel desk to the airport was also set at a fair price and I didn't feel ripped off. I didn't make use of the restaurant because of their questionable room service but found other restaurants within walkind distance as a replacement. It's definately a budget hotel but I wouldn't recommend it. 
hotel regent continental ,"Never again. . . We recently stayed at the Regent Continental Hotel in New Delhi after booking online having read a good review. We experienced many problems. Service from staff at reception was poor - promises made to do things were not fulfilled. Pressure was put on us to use expensive hotel taxis instead of reliable local transport. We were not able to successfully make phone calls from our room. The bathroom had a bug infestation. The complimentary breakfast consisted of four or five plates of things like bread, curd and filled parathas - which is fine on the surface - but the food was almost inedible and led to one of us getting sick. We attempted to book a taxi through the hotel for our departure and found at the last minute that they had not done it and we had to go in the hotel car which was far more expensive to do. The room itself was ok. The TV worked and power cuts were minimal. The location was also good. But overall our experience was a very negative one. We certainly wouldn't recommend that any women travelling alone book themselves into this hotel. "
hotel regent continental ,"Loved the Regent My room was large, open and spacious with a balcony, refrigerator, large beds and a nice large bath room. The hotel staff went out of their way to be accommodating and all were so kind and friendly. There is a travel desk in the lobby and Mr. Ahmed will do everything from make your plane or train reservations to arrange tours or just get a car and driver to take you shopping. There is a lovely gift shop in the large, white marble lobby. The restaurant serves a good complimentary breakfast and has a nice menu of Chinese and Indian foods. Mineral water is available there also. There was never a problem of running out of hot water for showers at any time of the day or night and the hotel has a good back up system for the frequent power failures. Their laundry service is fast and efficient. Room service is available 24 hours a day and food is reasonably priced. This was my first trip to Delhi but if I have an opportunity to return it will definitely be to the same place. I spent 8 days there and would recommend the Hotel Regent Continental to anyone. I would also like to thank each member of the staff for making my stay in India so very enjoyable. "

hotel royal holidays ,"Good value for money First impression wasn't good, as the ac, tv , gyser and bathroom lights of the room i was given wasn't working. however when i complained about that, the staff at the front desk acknowledged it, and told me that they were aware of it and offered another room to me as soon as one was available. However they fixed it within an hour. Apart from that there was no problem. we booked taxis and delhi sight seeing through the hotel's tarvel desk which was fantastic.

hotel royal holidays ,"So so but location is good I booked this via hotels.com for 1330rs a night, inclusive of tax. reception was very dowdy, felt like a step back to late 80s. check in was prompt, and they had their own scanner so they can take copies of my passport straightaway.room itself was fairly small, just about fit the double bed. it had a kettle and some mugs, but i didn't use them. AC was clunky but worked. bathroom had a vent in it which was fairly noisy. linen felt clean and bed was comfortable. overall nothing to shout about, but it will do, given the location and the price. the basement restaurant served breakfast: boiled eggs, toast with butter and jam, cornflakes, tea and coffee. there was also chapati. i would suggest having breakfast to go as the restaurant is quite dismal, with a leaky pipe and general air of tiredness.there is a lift in the building and it works fine. There is a restaurant opposite which does good quality indian fare at a reasonable price, all in air conditioned and dim-light ambience. "
hotel royal holidays ,"Very pleasant environment with excellent service and accommodation This hotel was a good fit for my son and I. We arrived at 2:30 am after being picked up at the airport.

hotel royal holidays ,Good Location I stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays for three nights and i found the hotel very nice. the hotel has excellent staff who takes good care of you and they make sure that you get everything on time. the most significant thing about the hotel is its close proximity to the metro station and the restaurant is just opposite to the hotel.. and the karol bagh market is just 2 mins walk from the hotel ... 
hotel royal holidays ,"Do not go this place! We had an awful holiday in this hotel. The staff was not professional and they even tried to cheat us many times. They were really ***holes towards to us. When they didn't get us as many tips as they wanted, they tried to cancel our connection way to the Agra. It was scary and very unpleasant. So we left this place before our check-out date. And - of course - we didn't get anything back. These pictures in TripAdvisor of this hotel are fake. The street is very dirty and full of everything you might even imagine. The rooms are very dark, dirty and water comes - when it comes. So if you want to stay in a place what is called hotel - don't even think about this ratt hole. "

I highly recommend this place. Great food and service and the prices were reasonable (600-700 rupees for 2).The hotel is just a block away from tons of shopping in Karol Bagh.

hotel royal holidays ,"Unprofessional reception According to the booking by Expedia airport pick-up was included and the rooms should be two &quot;super deluxe doubles&quot;. The hotel had been notifyed about flight number and arrival time. The flight arrived at Delhi airport somewhat delayed and there was nobody from the hotel waiting for us. Fortunately, this was not our first visit to Delhi so we knew that there is a prepaid taxi counter outside the airport. At the hotel reception we were told that someone had been at the airport for us. Shouldn't they check if there is a delay? The reception staff was not interested in discussing this matter. The double rooms we got the first night were disappointing, to say the least. Very small dirty rooms with leftovers from previous guests, only double beds although twin beds had been booked. Not what you want after a long flight.The next day we got two decent rooms with twin beds. In spite of this, our first impression remained - that some of the staff was not professional and showed lack of interest. "
hotel royal holidays ,"A good deal! I booked this hotel through the Thank You Points website after reading some posiitive reviews in Trip Advisor. A couple of weeks before I went to Delhi I read some negative reviews and was very concerned. When my family and I arrived there late in in the night I was pleasantly surprised of the location and cleanliness of the Hotel. The staff were very courteous and the room was clean and sufficiently equiped. The following morning we were served with a good breakfast in our room. Our stay of 3 nights was very comfortable and as we were interested in shopping, the shopping area was down the street from the Hotel. Karol Bagh is the best place for bargain hunters. I will most certainly recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a decently priced hotel with breakfast located in a central area in Delhi. "
hotel royal holidays ,"Overpriced! I stayed at this hotel mid Jan for one night and couldn't get out of the place fast enough!There were no towels in our room, we had to ask for them twice. The Room was dark and gloomy as it had no windows and the wardrobe doors were jammed closed so we could not use it.I was very tempted to move after we arrived but as it was late in the evening and were leaving the next day I decided to put up with it but I was sorry to spend my last night in India is such a miserable hotel.The worst was when late that night after being out for dinner and returning to go to bed I pulled back the bed covers to find there was no top sheet on the bed, we just had a thick blanket(which I really couldn't be sure is washed in between visitors),as it was late and we were tired we did not bother to request a top sheet so I ended up sleeping in my clothes!Finally we had the worst nights sleep because of the noise, seemed to be a combination of road works and internal noise in the hotel!We gave breakfast a miss as it was in the basement (again no windows!) and it looked rather average or maybe our overall experience suppressed our appetite!The most basic accommodation we stayed at had at least fresh sheets and towels, this place is massively overpriced and I would not recommend "
hotel royal holidays ,"overpriced! We stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays during a recent trip to India. The hotel was clean enough but the room was very expensive for what it was. We were paying around 1400Rs for a very basic room without a window which was often smelly. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful on the whole, however ignore any help they offer in hiring a taxi/rickshaw as you'll find one much cheaper yourself by simply walking down the road. The main problem we had with this hotel was the incessant noise all through the night. It felt like we were were sleeping in the middle of a building site (which we probably were!) and even if the workers stopped, the staff or noisy elevator (with music!) would soon wake us. If you have to stay here, make sure you have your earplugs.It's hard to find a good value hotel in Delhi, so you may as well choose a budget option. It may not be the nicest place but it beats paying way over the odds for something that's not much better!One more thing, if you haven't paid for your booking through the internet, it's worth asking them to lower the price of the room. We threatened to leave after a night and they lowered their price considerably. "
hotel royal holidays ,very average Stayed here at the start and end of our trip... rooms are ok but as with everything in Delhi well overpriced for what you get. Breakfast is terrible but there is toast... Rooms are ok with showers that produce a dribble... Biggest let down for us was the unhelpful nature of the staff. Every question i asked resulted in them trying to make money off us... How do we get to Conaught Place... Dont worry ill get you a taxi... How much?... About 200 Rs... isnt that a bit expensive?? Well we can get you a rickshaw... How much? About 100Rs... Only because we met some fellow travellers did they tell us about the metro 2 minutes away and only 8Rs to Conaught Place!!!Stay here if you have to but if i ever return to Delhi i wouldnt go back 
hotel royal holidays ,"Looked OK but they lodged us in another hotel! We booked one night in this hotel, but when we arrived they said that another guest had missed their flight, and they would have to put us up in another hotel. They drove us there, and were vey polite about it, and the other hotel was fine, but we were still a little disappointed. Still, the area was fine, handy for anywhere you might want, and near the metro if you don't want to risk your skin in an auto. "
hotel royal holidays ,"Comfrotable and Clean Hotel Royal Holidays is a clean and very confortable hotel. It has spacious rooms and clean bathrooms. The service here is excellent .

hotel royal holidays ,"Try to find better place Like others I chose this hotel only because of its good reviews. Reality was hard to accept. I wasn't expecting much with the price I paid but...

To sum up it is close to metro station and also very nice market so if you are looking for chaep accomodation with hostel standards, you can try this one. Always keep their business card with you because taxi drivers don't know this place at all. "
hotel royal holidays ,"fair but some irritations booked this hotel through expedia after reading favorable reviews here, had to stay a night in delhi on my way to nepal. called the hotel day before to confirm reservation, and give them my flight information for free airport pickup which was promised. they said 'no problem we'll be there.' showed up at the airport with no one waiting for me. when i called the hotel, they denied having my flight info, and also then refused to pick me up from the domestic airport, and they only do international, citing hotel policy. they advised i take a cab. i arrived in karol bagh via prepaid taxi (175rs) and they had a hard time finding the hotel, the driver had to call to get directions. after my arrival, staff was friendly and put me up in the room i reserved, however the decor was very odd, a king bed with gold sheets made for a campy 70s feel. shower had this strange radio which freaked me out when it turned on suddenly, good hot water if you turn on the heater. good pressure. breakfast was standard with a few indian dishes, bread, and eggs. nothing to get excited over. overall the stay would have been okay if they hadn't confirmed picking me up and then refusing later. hotel was in a decent location, within walking distance of the metro, but just too hard to find. looks nothing like the photo because they photoshopped all the other hotels out of the picture and put in sky instead. "
hotel royal holidays ,"Dump Hotel Useless staff This Hotel is a fake, we booked here because it was 7th on the ranking, and when I think about the horrible night we passed there I cannot understand how can has that score. I even thought that they have written the reviews themselves or using friends. But at the end of the day 20£ for a couple one night you get what you pay a dump place. The staff is completely useless, with no manners at all, and since you step into the hotel no matter about your long flight they start trying to con you with all sort of crap deals....Our room was facing to the street and there are works in progress in front of the hotel 24 hours, and I mean 24 hours the whole night, listening to hammers, saws, people shouting etc....The air con, when you look at it you turn it off as you think you are going to die if you breath that air coming through that dirt and mud equipment. The painting of the walls coming off, the shower well better to say the water drops coming out of it, there is no pressure...We checked out early next morning as we had to take a train to Jaipur, and there were people sleeping on the stairs, the guy of the reception on the sofa at the entrance, we had to wake him up to check out.....Rest of food on the corridors,.....to be honest for a few quid more get to somewhere else and save your self that sort of entry to India.The good things are the area which is excellent with a market full of bargains, the metro station which is just around the corner, plenty of agencies, plenty of auto rickshaws cycle rickshaws etc....Karol Bagh is a very safe area to walk at day or night, although at night in India there is not much to do. So I would not hang around too much...There is a free airport pick up service but this is standard now in most hotels, if you book trough expedia etc I recommend contact the hotel directy trough their web site for this service. But as I said this is provided by any Hotel. After our first night in this dumped place we decided that our next hotel in delhi was the clarck international which is more expensive, but is on the same area, the food is excellent, the staff is very professional and helpful, and it is worth it after the busy days on the city the crowded metros, the markets etc.... "
hotel royal holidays ,"Nice Stay excellent service Was in Delhi just a week ago. Stayed at Royal Holidays Hotel in Karol Bagh, New Delhi. The Hotel is neat, tidy and clean and theservice was excellent. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. was met with eager, smiling faces and immediate attention was given to all my requests. Tour company recommended the hotel and was very helpful in arranging my very short trip at a very short notice. The hotel is central to Delhi and the shopping is just within walking distance. There is a medical centre just next door and lots of restaurants nearby. Rooms are big and affordable even for a budget traveller. Internet is also available so I did not have to go out looking for internet cafe.I would stay there again if I go back to Delhi. "
hotel royal holidays ,I like delhi Hotel Royal holidays is a good place to stay in delhi. But the problem is tour operator connecting with the hotel trying to waste time of the tourist by showing expensive tour plans. room is good but they have to clean room daily. Hot water is also a big problem in the hotel. 
hotel royal holidays ,"Decent place to stay in central Delhi This is a decent hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. There are like a million hotels in a few blocks radius that all look similar to Hotel Royal Holidays. The location is the best thing about this hotel. Karol Bagh is central to just about anything you'd want to do in Delhi - and Karol Bagh is a nice area with a great open air market and places to eat just a few steps from the hotel. The metro is also just a couple of blocks away.The room itself was dirty by my standards so I didn't take my shoes off while in my room, but I got the impression that most hotels in the area are probably like this. And for some reason they don't put a top sheet on your bed - I couldn't figure this out because there was no way I was going to cover up with the gross bedspread next to my skin! We had to ask for an extra sheet a few times. The service was pretty good when we ordered coffee or asked for something. The biggest warning I would give you is that they have an &quot;associated&quot; travel agency run by a man named Abid Zargar who will hard sell you on a trip to Agra or wherever you mention you want to go. Travel services are fine and Abid is trustworthy, but we practically felt like we were being controlled by the Mafia while we were there. So beware when you check into Hotel Royal Holidays and stick to your guns. Don't let them make you feel bad for not complying with what they want you to do - it's YOUR trip after all! We felt like we spent part of our trip arguing with Abid, which is frustrating when we were only staying in India for a couple of weeks - certainly not how I wanted to spend my time! I just wanted a hotel to stay at!! "
hotel royal holidays ,"Great Option for Delhi! We stayed in this hotel on our way out of Delhi after having had a bad experience at a place in the Pahar Ganj area of Delhi. I am so glad we found this place! This hotel is located in a quiet section of the city a $1-$2 auto rickshaw ride from everywhere. (There is also a metro station about 2 blocks away). There are many restaurants and shops within a block or two. The service is quite good, and the staff is very helpful and accommodating. I realize that there are not many good mid-range options in Delhi, but this place is great. I seriously have no complaints about this place. I would recommend the Hotel Royal Holidays to anyone who does not want to stay in a rock-bottom backpacker-type place. "
hotel royal holidays ,"Love this Hotel It was our first time in India and we were so scared as we been heard many things about the touts at the airport but we were greeted at the airport with a hotel taxi driver who drove very safely in the night and droped us off at the hotel.We found the Hotel reception welcoming always during our stay.We went to a tourist Information office down the street which was recomended by the hotel staff,they helped us to organise our transportation and train tickets from place to place on basic prices.One nagative point which I should say about the restaurant which was under construction during our 3 days stay but room service was great and pretty fast.I will definetly stay in this hotel again and will recomend this hotel to the budget class travelers... "
hotel royal holidays ,"The hotel provides good service! Room was also good - if you like with window, better ask for it - but might be better without window. We booked via Expedia. There was a guy at the reception named Sajad who gave us a free taxi ride TO the airport. Thanks! "
hotel royal holidays ,"Nice and clean hotel very good staff This is my second time in India in last year I have booked hotel Suncity from Expedia I was not so happy because room size was very small there was no restaurant unfortunately we have to take breakfast in our room , this time I went tripadviser website and I have seen review of Hotel Royal Holidays first I was thinking this all review is fake but when I booked through expedia one night and I have call (Mr. Sajad Manager of Hotel ) he promise me he will pickup us from the international Airport on our arrival driver was waiting for us .when we reached hotel it was really nice hotel and very clean size of the rooms very spacious very clean bathroom free Wi Fi complimentary breakfast . I have stayed there 3 nights it was wonderful experience I really highly recommend this hotel "
hotel royal holidays ,"Friendly comfortable hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays a total of 4 nights (2 at the beginning of our trip and 2 near the end) and we had no problems there whatsoever. The rooms are clean with huge beds, private bathroom with shower and television, including towels and sheets. We paid 30 Dollars per night with breakfast and airport pick up included. Also, they have Internet available for guests in lobby (extra charge but very cheap). The staff are very friendly and help with any queries. They helped us organise the first part of our trip (they have links with a travel agency just down the road from the hotel) which was reasonable priced. The staff even let us leave our luggage at the hotel on our last day (when we hadn't even stayed there our last night!) so they are just really helpful and friendly people.The area where the hotel is located, Karol Bagh, can be a bit of a shock at first (old buildings, crowded), but that is just Delhi!! Also, there is a really good market just round the corner from the hotel which is great for buying souvenirs and pretty much anything! There are cafés and restaurants nearby too, just 2 min walk away.The metro station is just a 5 min walk from the hotel (Karol Bagh stop) which is 3 stops from Connaught Place, so it's very conveniently located.I have no bad things to say about this hotel as overall it was a great place to stay!Nicola M &amp; David C "

hotel shanti palace ,"Loved The Rooms This Hotel is always my choice when ever I have to stay very near to the Airport. The Rooms are so well managed, that I love to stay in them. the working staff is alsr really good and so good is the food there. I would recommend you all that if you are looking for a budget hotel, then do visit this place. This is worth everything and you will also get good amount of corporate discounts. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Backup hotel close to the airport - OK only if you have no other choice Compared to many other Hotel in New Delhi, this hotel is better than average. But I would not consider it any better than a backup not to far away from the airport. The value for money is really bad:- The hotel is located in a very noisy area.- My room was very dirty (floor, walls, bathroom).- After looking at the bed sheet, I decided to take a 2nd shower after sleeping.- The breakfast was a mix between British and Indian styles, but the worse of both.The service was a mix: when I checked in, evenso I arrived after 11pm, the service was very friendly, quick and efficient. The next day, the reception was quite unfriendly and agressive. I still do not know why. "
hotel shanti palace ,Delhi Airport Hotel Nice clean rooms. Tad expensive but I booked thru IRCTC website and got an allinclusive rate.Though IRCTC did not mention free B/F they gave it 
hotel shanti palace ,"Grear Hotel If you want to have a meeting close to airport, Hotel Shanti palace is the right choice. Its has nice big rooms and tasty restaurent, Though its a bit expensive but its worth to sat there.I stayed there for 2 nights it was a pleasent stay for me. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Average for the price This is an OK place to stay if you need to be near the airport, but that is probably the only positive thing to say about its location. The hotel overlooks a busy flyover route into Delhi and the area around the hotel is particularly grotty and nondescript should you be thinking of taking an evening stroll. We would not recommend staying here for any other reason than to be close to the airport. The hotel is smart and nicely decorated. Our room was clean and well furnished and we had a bath, as well as a shower. On pulling back the curtains we found a wall about 1ft away from the window, so no panorama. Hotels in Delhi seem not to see windows as a priority so we weren't particularly surprised. On balance we would recommend stay here for the airport, but not for any other reason. Its a long way from the centre of Delhi and the general area is not particularly nice. Once inside the Hotel is is quite nice, and has a decent bar/restaurant with albeit, far more waiters and floor managers than are actually needed. This hotel cost us Rs7000 per night (about £100). This is about three or four times the cost of hotels in the Paharganj area and although the rooms were a lot better we couldn't really say it was great value. There don't seem to be any mid-range hotels in Delhi though and if you want something of a decent standard and don't want to pay $300 a night then this is not a bad option. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Shanti Palace -- Surprisingly Nice! Shanti Palace is a great hotel if you just need a place to sleep for a night or two. With my husband being from India we were shocked to see hotel prices in Delhi between $300 and $400 USD a Night!!! This place was recommended to us by family member and for about $180 USD per night we were pleasantly surprised. It is located less than 5 minutes from the airport with optional driver pick-up service for about 600 rupees one way (not including a tip). The room was incredibly clean and comfortable for 2 people and we had the option between twin beds or a king. The room was completely granite including the floors, bathroom and counter tops and it came equipt with a mini-fridge as well as a flat screen TV. There is also a high speed fan in the room as well as A/C. Breakfast is included at the Tripti Restaurant &amp; Bar downstairs and lunch is affordable. Beware if you want to purchase alcohol you must be over the age of 25. There is also travel agent located in the lobby who can help you arrange transportation back to the airport if need be. The only complaint we would have had was that the only view your window in the room might have is of pipes or an enclosed stairway. However, after more than 30 hours of traveling we didn't care about a view. All we wanted was a nice hot shower and a place to lay our heads. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Outstanding experience with the Shanti Palace A delayed connecting flight made us miss a 1 AM flight from the Delhi Airport. We stayed in the Shanti Palace for 2 nights and were very pleased with the hotel. Our room seems to have been recently renovated and was extremely clean and well appointed. Beautiful bathroom, excellent room service, and the entire staff was very helpful. Breakfast is included in the room price and the buffet was acceptable. At $155 per night, we thought we received good value for our money. "
hotel shanti palace ,"poor service Meet and greet from staff is very poor. Do not understand English. Reception staff stopped serving me, snatched the guest book and started to serve an American Guest. I did get very offended by this and told him on the face. Staff do not know how to smile and welcome guests. In the end gave us the key for a room that was not even ready.Getting an extra bed proved an hour long argument!!Hotel owner needs to know what their staff behave like and how they could be losing valued customers. Hotel needs to have more site seeing leaflets on display. "
hotel shanti palace ,OK for stay-over from Airport OK and clean. Has restaruant ok.We got a deluxe suite where we stayed with our two young daughters.Better take a room not facing the highway (noise).Close to airport. We paid around 300 rupies for transport to airport. 
hotel shanti palace ,"A Good Place for Business Travellers I cannot agree with some bad comments made on this Hotel. Although the Hotel is located in &quot;middle of nowhere&quot;, the facilities offered are reasonable for Business travellers. The views out of the window may not be a worry for such travellers. I surly cannot agree with the comment regarding the rudeness of the staff, who in my opinion were very courteous. I would have wished for few more choices in the breakfast menu. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Below average hotel I stayed a single night at the Shanti Palace and found the hotel to be a very poor hotel. First and foremost, the hotel is outdated. To register for a room, you must sign a registration book that is straight out of the 18th century. Second the doors lock with a latch that you find on your outdoor fence. The single beds are extremely small. If your over 6.0feet/1.80m, then you're probably too big for the beds. The rooms are not clean at all. I would never return to this hotel! "
hotel shanti palace ,"Expensive Hotel seems to have been recently refurbished. Rooms are small but clean. Price on their website was Rs4600, we were charged Rs6600. Poor value for money. Reasonably close to airport. "
hotel shanti palace ,"Unbelievable rude. Food poisoning. Tiny very dirty rooms. Avoid!!! This is a hotel in the middle of nowhere, next to the airport(about 3-4 kms, 2-3 miles). The staff is extremely rude. Therooms are very small and are facing a wall. Literally, there'sa wall about 1m in front of ALL the rooms' windows. Thereception staff is not only rude but also over-price each andevery item they can - e.g., hotel-airport ride (they charged us8USD, the street price was about USD4). The restaurant in thehotel is extremely expensive, roughly 4 times the normal New Delhi prices. Some people with us got food poisoningfrom that food, the second day. They stayed inside for 2 daysjust to recover. There is literally NOTHING close to this hotel.Just avoid it please, if you have a chance. On the other hand,I am not sure if you can get much better in Delhi in general.However, for about USD 140 (roughly USD 30 more than Shanti Palace, if you want to fork out that much), the hyatt isok, has free wireless etc. A friend of ours stayed there. "
hotel shanti palace ,It was a very safe and clean hotel. We were three women that shared a good size room for three nights. The hotel was safe and very clean and that was the most important thing to us. Friendly staff. Food was good. And it was not as expenssive as 3 or 4 star hotels that were poorly reviewed. The hotel was near the airport and a little far from the city. But we rented a taxi with a driver all day for a 1000 rubies. The same taxi took us to Agra and back for 2500 Rubies. Great deal. 
hotel singh sahib ,"Not bad The best thing about hotel Singh Sahib is its location very near to the Karol Bagh main market and metro station. This was my only criteria to book this hotel.Apart from location, this place has nothing much to offer. The staff was untrained and sounded a bit fishy. The rooms were small and bathroom even smaller. Its located in a semi-residential area and initially I had problems in locating the place. This place is only recommended for individual stay for 1-2 days in Delhi. "
hotel singh sahib ,"Ideal location in KarolBagh with posh Interiors About the Hotel : I got to know about this hotel through my freinds who had stayed there before. I was looking for an ideal place to stay thats not too expensive (within 2K INR per double room) and at the same time nearby shopping areas of Delhi. Rooms with good interirors are always my choice when it comes to staying with family. This hotel excelled my expectations interms of interiors.Location : This is very near to the famous Karol Bagh market. Its a five minute walk to the shopping area. The hotel is located in a nearby side lane thats not too posh. The metro station is about 15 minute walk or rs 20 by auto. Food : The room service did take sometime but the food was of good quality. There is NO complimentary breakfast in this hotel. Service : The room boys had a smile on them when they attended to us and the reception desk was always ready to offer help. I would say that overall they were very helpful and courteous.In a nutshell: If you travelling with family or on business and looking for a hotel with excellant interiors and a convenient location , then this hotel will be one of my recommendations... "
hotel singh sahib ,"Don't bother I would highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel when you're in Delhi. It was our very first stop after flying in and probably the least welcoming hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff were rude and always yelled at each other, with the noise echoing right up the stairwell. Our room was tiny and dark, with no window and an overflowing toilet. We asked for the toilet to be fixed and someone came in and did something to it then demanded a tip, even though the toilet was clearly not fixed. The staff also tried to overcharge us for food and drinks that we had, claiming that the menu listed an incorrect price. We had no hot water and no room to move and couldn't wait to get out of there. Karol Bagh, though quite interesting, is not a good area to stay in as it's hard to get around and takes awhile to get anywhere. There are also lots of hotels in the area and no auto rickshaw driver ever knew where we wanted to go, so of course they tried to just drop us off elsewhere. On our way back through Delhi we stayed at the Eleven guesthouse, which cost a bit more but not that much and it managed to completely restore our faith in Delhi being a good place to visit. Steer clear of the Singh Sahib. "
hotel singh sahib ,"Stay somewhere else By the second night, we were calling this the &quot;Hotel Suck Sahib.&quot; It's dirty, it's noisy, and it's located in a crappy area with nothing interesting to do and a long tuk-tuk ride between you and anything worthwhile. After every excursion, we had trouble getting back to the hotel because none of the tuk-tuk drivers could find it, even with the hotel's card and map. It took an average of four stops for directions to actually find the place.If you absolutely must stay here, at all costs avoid room T-2. It's on the top floor and shares a wall with the kitchen, which means you will hear chopping, clanging, and crashing all night long, in addition to the loud voices and radio of the kitchen staff. It's marginally quieter on other floors (unless the staff starts moving furniture at 4 am, which happened during our stay), but the rooms are still dirty and uncomfortable. If you're going to stay in a crummy budget hotel, at least make it somewhere more conveniently located than this dump. "
hotel singh sahib ,"Small room and no opening window Location of the hotel is pretty near the sky train station. The room is quite small. There is no chair inside the room. The window does not open. Air ventilation is bad. Luckily the ceiling fan was working ok. We had to wait about 10 mins. to get the hot shower. At the time we stayed, there was no restaurant in the hotel. The mangement said it was being renovated. We were served american breakfast at our room for 100 rp. But the breakfast was rather bad. The toast was hard. Coffe was only warm. "
hotel singh sahib ,"Not bad could be better We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in December. The hotel is a midrange hotel ( paid Rs. 2200). Our room was clean and spacious enough to accomodate our family of two adults and one child on the bed (although we thought the bed could have been a bit longer to accomodate our feet as well..:)..) and had room for an extra bed. The bathroom was clean and had running hot water, a necessity during this part of the year in Delhi. They were willing to provide in-room service for the items on their menu while the in-house restaurant was being planned. We had breakfast in the (Bikanerwala) Angan restaurant nearby and ate a very reasonably priced fresh local Indian meal . There was also a good travel agent in the neighborhood from whom we hired a taxi for local Delhi sightseeing for a day.Pros: Courteous staff, good location, clean room and bathroom; Cons: Very poor noise insulation, from our hotel rooms (on the first and second floor) could hear noise in the corridor and the reception (which is why I am rating this hotel average) "
hotel singh sahib ,"Very nice new hotel in Karol Bagh (Our stay December 2007)We walked out on the lousy Hotel Metro Heights. We packed our stuff and walked right next door to the Singh Sahib hotel. I think my Indian friend was learning by now as he said that the Singh Sahib was a little more money and all they had left was a suite, but that was OK as it was more important that we were comfortable where we stayed.In the Singh Sahib, we were placed in a suite on the 1st floor right behind check in. It appeared that the hotel looked new and they were still renovating a little. The restaurant was still not complete. However, the room was large and clean and new and had a working AC. It also did not reek of cigarettes. Unfortunately I’m not sure how long it will stay that way as the hotel apparently appeals to smokers. I chastised a Chinese guest stepping off the elevator with a lit cigarette and his response was that there was no sign. I was sure that not smoking in an elevator was a universal courtesy?As I said, the room was new, cleanly marbled and freshly painted. As nice as it was there still were some quirky problems. First, although everything appeared clean, the workers neglected to clean the walls around the toilet, just a small oversight. Also, they had a cheap temporary curtain that went across the bathroom covering the shower and tub. This we found was prone to come down easily. There was hot water, but it took a while to show up. There were frequent electricity outages, but only for a minute or two.The soaps were the best quality we found during our travels in India. They brought extra towels on request. There was no mini bar in the room. Breakfast was included but because the restaurant was closed, we had to order by room service. There was a small glitch in getting the food, but it finally came. We had to then ask for silverware and napkins. We were surprised to find French toast on the menu, but it came plain and they offered no syrup. We went to compliment the front desk and apparent owners on the quality of the hotel and rooms. We were told that they must have the cheap curtains in the bathrooms as the Indian guests bathe with the bucket and cup, splashing the water over their bodies to rinse and in the process drench the room. They really were not interested in talking to me. When I asked to take a couple of pictures of another room to post on TA, they refused and handed me a pamphlet saying I could see the pictures there.The one thing that really upset me about this hotel was the scam the owners appeared to be playing on their guests. I’m not sure if it actually hurt the guests, but it was probably more to shield their income from the government. I watched as they appeared to overcharge one of the Chinese guests checking out. She was tough and those guys were not going to get one over on her. When she asked for a receipt, they tried to talk around the subject, and finally went to write a receipt on a piece of note paper. The girl insisted on an official invoice and they finally succumb. It was funny when she asked why they had to play all of these games for which they replied with a sly meekish smile. Unfortunately I still think they were up to something as they gave her the original and kept the copy receipt. I did not realize they did the same thing to my travel agent friend who paid the bill for me. When I was later telling him about the Chinese girl, we looked at our receipt and found they had done the same thing to him. We went back later to reclaim our bags being held for us after check out, and made them give us a proper invoice.Again this place is right next door to the Hotel Metro Heights. Both have front desk people that are plenty rough around the edges, but the Singh Sahib is ten times better. The Singh Sahib maybe a bit more expensive and the rooms may be a bit smaller, but for the few extra dollars I'd stay here and not ruin my vacation at the Metro Heights. Just make sure to ask for an official receipt when you leave. "
hotel singh sons ,"Basic small rooms ..... Clean and Tidy Not bad, but the rooms are very small - not enough space to manouvre between the bed and the TV. The air conditioning only worked in the rooms, and was incredibly noisy and smelly. Not enough towels (problem in most hotels in India). Cable TV, yummy room service, but the porters hang around until they get a tip!! "
hotel singh sons ,"Average tourist hotel with rotten breakfast Stayed here with smallish tour party of 13. The room itself was fine, comfortable and spacious although dark. A notice on the door said hot water had to be requested in advance, but we ignored this and had no problems. Don't know if this was just luck. Room had fridge which was useful.No restaurant at this hotel, but we had breakfast 2 days running, once straight off the overnight train. Both times, but especially the first, service at breakfast was terrible. It seemed as if one serving of a fairly poor selection was set out and when that ran out it was tough. The fruit juice tasted as if it was coloured water.Overall an average and adequate budget tour hotel in a fairly quiet area, but the breakfast experience made it unpleasant. "
hotel singh sons ,average to below average Stayed here in Jan 2008 and was overall a pretty average experience.Room was reasonably clean with hot water in shower but it was freezing cold(about 2c)with no heating in the room at all.We repeatedly asked for a heater to be brought up but they brought a broken one up and plugged it in then left.lolBreakfest is pretty average also.Overall not the best value for money. 
hotel singh sons ,To be avoided !! Stayed there at the start of a tour of northern India. Hotel had been organised by tour company so we had no choice. The rooms were dull and dark - as was most of the hotel. We arrived after a long flight in the middle of day and tried to get a bit of rest but there is a building site right beside the hotel and they work 24 hours !!! The constant drilling and hammering was unbearable. We asked to be moved to another room but it was exactly the same. The staff start working at approx 4am and continously shout up the corridors at each other - they have absolutely no regard for the people staying there. Hot water has to be ordered in advance and the sheets and towels are dirty - they are dried on the street outside the hotel and smell of petrol fumes !!! We were booked in to stay there on our last night but refused to stay there and found a much nicer hotel in New Delhi for a much better rate. I would not recommend this hotel and would advise travellers to avoid it at all costs !!! 
hotel singh sons ,"Cold Delhi Stayed for 7 days, very cold outside 10 degress and inside 18, could not pay with creditcards ??? only cash, bad exchangerates ! very noisy at the room from the other guest and staff. "
hotel singh sons ,"Good Clean Hotel I am a travel agent and therefore sell hotels all over the world for my clients so to experience myself is always a bonus to give an honest opinion.This hotel was good - not amazing, not bad either. The rooms were clean, bathrooms adequate, breakfast edible and hotel staff were helpful. Room service was fast and efficient. For a 3 star hotel in Delhi I feel it is good value for money.My main recommendation would be a bigger pillow on the bed as they were a little on the biscuit thin side but this is my personal preference. "
hotel singh sons ,Good hotel fo Delhi I stayed here at the start and end of a tour. I was expecting the worst after reading some of the reviews but gladly I had a pleasant stay. The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff are professional. The buffet breakfast is not bad by Indian standards. The location is good you can walk to Karol Bagh main street and Metro station in 15 mins. I stayed in another hotel in Karol Bagh and had a terrible experience so I would recommend Singh Sons. 
hotel singh sons ,"Good midrange option in good location Singh Sons is tucked down as side street in a quiter part of Karol Bagh. The lobby is airy, cool and clean, with lots of marble, and the staff welcoming. The room was a reasonable size, and the bathroom was clean and tidy. No window views, but this is Delhi! One reviewer complained about the short beds - well I'd agree, but I am 1.89m, and the beds are probably 2m wide, so there are ways round the problem. Mattress was definitely 'firm'. Breakfast room was bearable, but really needs some money spending on it. Breakfast was OK. Being in Karol Bagh, the main market is only a few minutes walk away, and is a great place to shop - real shops, many with fixed prices, as well as the street traders. Certainly not as intimidating for Western tourists asthe local street markets. "
hotel singh sons ,"Rooms are ok Attitude/service is horrendous I stayed here as part of an organized tour. The rooms themselves are fine by Indian standards - the hot water problems and electricity issues described by other travelers are typical for the country. The attitude of the front desk staff, however, is not fine by any standard. The staff is rude at best. After speaking with the other members of my group (a very relaxed and flexible bunch!), nearly all of us had been barked at or scammed during our stay.They pulled the credit card machine deal with me, as well, forcing me to pay in cash for my first night before the organized tour (at a rate, by the way, that was almost triple what others were paying. Do NOT email the hotel for a room quote, they will not give you an accurate price).I had organized a hotel transfer through the hotel. I arrived at nearly midnight to the Delhi airport, and, after waiting for over 30 mins and being unable to find my transfer, I found another cab. When I arrived at the hotel, the staff &quot;welcomed&quot; me by yelling at me, saying that my cab was at the airport and I would have to pay for it. I politely refused. After showing me to my room, a hotel manager called at 1:15 AM to tell me AGAIN that I would have to pay for the cab. I refused. Upon check out, the staff AGAIN tried to charge me for the unused transfer, and I refused again.As I said, while the rooms are acceptable, I cannot recommend a hotel that treats tourists like walking dollar signs. Go elsewhere, there are better options! "
hotel singh sons ,"Basic cityhotel with an annoying breakfast policy Basic city hotel. Stayed here three times with two rooms as Delhi was the returning point of our trip. Rooms are fairly clean and quiet but there's almost everytime a problem with the facilities (even for Indian standards): Non-flushing toilets, broken airco etc. They have an impossible breakfast policy. You get an unsollicited wakeup call at 8:00 (Great! We arrived at 2:00 AM after a late flight!) At 9 the breakfast buffet-attempt stops. The breakfast is lousy. Toast and flakes, Indian ommelette and banana's. That's it. After the third day we decided to take a Tuk-tuk to the Costa Coffee at Connaught's. A bit decadent, but a great treat!Avoid the internet service. It has the speed of a snail at a stiff rate, and as the printer is also used for copying, your PC will hang up half way your email.Location (Karol Bagh) is great! Nice market and huge variety of shops at only 100 metres "
hotel singh sons ,"ok but could do a lot better My wife and I stayed at Singh Sons as part of a tailor made tour with On The Go India. The hotel is in the Karol Bagh suburb of New Delhi. There are quite a few mid-range tourist type hotels in the area, with Singh Sons being the smartest looking of the 5 or 6 I spotted. We were told by a tour guide that the area grew from a refugee colony but i'm not sure how true this is. Other reviewers have commented that they did not feel safe in the area. I did not notice this; some parts of Karol Bagh are scruffy, but for central Delhi, a lot of it is fairly smart. I would have been a bit wary of walking anywhere at night though. For some reason, no taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers were willing to take us to Connaught Place from here. We never worked out why this was, but it didn’t matter too much as Karol Bagh Station is a ten minute walk or 2 minute rickshaw ride away and from there you can get the new and very efficient metro. When you venture out, do make sure you have the hotel's exact address and preferably a decent map, as we found that no drivers had heard of it and had a lot of difficulty working out how to get back at night.The hotel itself seems quite modern from the outside and the reception area is very smart, all in marble. The bedrooms are not so smart though. We were first given a standard double room, which was clean but shabby and very gloomy. the windows in all of the rooms are small and mostly covered up by air conditioning units. We asked to look at bigger rooms and ended up paying extra for a suite, which was well worth it for the extra space and a bigger bed. I think the hotel is in the process of re-decorating the rooms so hopefully this will brighten the place up a bit. The air-con worked well, which was very welcome and the shower was ok, although you had to call reception to request hot water 10 minutes before you used it. Free wi-fi was very useful.As with most places in Delhi, traffic noise is horrendous, so pack some earplugs if you are a light sleeper. there was a lot of noise late at night as well - what sounded like somebody panel beating at 1 on the morning every night.Breakfast was very basic buffet - toast, cereals (but only with hot milk???) and a small selection of hot indian food - breads, pakoras, potatoes etc. The eating area in the basement is also a bit weird with disco lights all over the celing and american wrestling permanently on the TV on the corner.The staff in the hotel were mixed - the bellboys were friendly and helpful, perhaps thanks to tips, but reception staff were indifferent, bordering on rude. Our most significant issue was when we returned for a second stay after a week away - the toilet had clearly not been cleaned and was really really disgusting – it looked like the seat was covered in diarrhoea. it was thoroughly cleaned as soon as we spoke to a member of staff but that doesn’t change the fact that it should not have happened in the first place. if we’d known the city better and didn't have transport arangements from the hotel the next morning we probably would have walked out.Overall, Singh Sons was ok for a short stay but the location isn't the best, the rooms are very gloomy and we were left with a very soured opinion by the toilet incident. Delhi is renowned for hotels being expensive but we would not want to stay at Singh Sons or anywhere like it again - I’d rather pay a lot more money for an upmarket place. "
hotel singh sons ,"Rubbish hotel We stayed here on our last night after a fantastic holiday. It was an appaling ending to a great trip.The room was clean, but that's the only positive thing to say. There was a lot of street noise and the water pump for thehotel was directly outside are room and burst into life in the middle of the night. It took several phonecalls and a walk to reception before anything was done about it.The hotel was in general fairly dingy and uninspiring.At best adequate. Avoid if possible. "
hotel singh sons ,"claustrophobic- worst stay of our trip Our Group stayed at The Hotel Singh Sons in Delhi. The rooms are small, claustrophobic and without windows. The length of the beds are shorter than normal and if you are over 5ft 8 your feet will hang over the end. Two of the rooms smelled of smoke and two of the showers did not work. Reception is unfriendly and slow to respond. Hotel porters watch while you struggle with your bags and wait to be asked to help. We did get some individual good service for which we tipped well. We arrived at 1am after a delayed flight and were asked to pay extra for breakfast if we wanted it after 9am. We all received an unasked for early morning call for breakfast!. All other hotels we stayed at for the other days, breakfast was served till 10 am. We asked our agent to move us but apparantly all hotels were booked out in Delhi. We had to stay 3 nights. We do not reccommend this hotel. In it's favour, it is quite well located in Karol bagh but that's its only good point. We noticed several other hotels in Karol Bagh (great for shopping), so try another hotel. "
hotel singh sons ,You can do much better.... Traveller reviews of this hotel praising its cleanliness etc are accurate however it is indeed absolutely spartan and if travelling in the late fall and winter the rooms can be cold. Hot water is just warm and must be requested 10 minutes prior to use. Bedding is threadbare. Packing your own toilet paper is key as the hotel provides very little. Avoid rooms on the main street side as it's extremely noisy. Staff and restaurant food are OK.The area in which the hotel is located is not the safest nor the most interesting in Delhi - this is however a hotel used by many tour companies as a first or last night in Delhi - if you have the choice opt for a higher grade hotel particularly if its your first night after a long flight and want even some minimal comfort. This is a tough first night in Delhi and this hotel offers little to soften the experience... 
hotel singh sons ,"Done the job What do you expect from a Hotel in a developing? I accept that the hotel was not 5* or even 4* in terms of presentation, amenities etc, but for being located in the peripheral of the city centre allows for good access to transport, eateries etc - it really couldn’t be better situated. I stayed there for 2 weeks whilst conducting research for my MSc dissertation, so I got to know the place rather well. A hairy experience around the corner with some of the locals knocked my nerves, but that was the only bad note in terms of the neighbour hood. For me, favoured most and by far exciting mode of transport are the local 'tuk tuks' which cost very little- but do remember to barter and agree a price for your journey BEFORE you set off as some try to rip you off, and don’t let them take you to a bazaar or anything- totally overpriced. Also remember that the majority of the cycle rickshaw riders/drivers are poorer than the motorised 'tuk tuk' drivers, so try to experience that and leave a small tip.Best thing for me in the hotel was the TV- allowed me to catch up on the cricket world cup as well as the footy back home, and its always exciting to grab some snacks from the small nearby shop and watch a Bollywood movie!I would certainly recommend this hotel; there are far worse places you could be staying! "
hotel singh sons ,"Very Bad Hotel in Delhi We booked the hotel through an agent for one room for 3 persons. Though the room looked very nice, we have hard time getting other things. No provision for making coffee. For hot water, you have to call the reception and wait for half an hour. Not many hanger to hang your clothes. Most importantly, the reception people are not trust-worthy. They tend to cheat if you are not aware of what is happening. They claim four star facilties and rates are expensive for the facility they have. Should be avioded. "
hotel singh sons ,"good air conditioners new place in crowded area of delhi good air conditioners when entered in such heat of india especially in summers, lobby was chilled &amp; cooled. offered us cold drinks &amp; as booked we got our room. we had a pleasing time at the hotel &amp; comfortable room was provided . Very centrally located in this busy streets of karol bagh, delhi. most accessible to market just opposite the hotel. helpful staff &amp; definitely a good experience in this new hotel.... tidy &amp; clean. "
hotel singh sons ,"A decent place but beware of typical scams A decent place to stay in a very congested part of Delhi. I stay in hotels throughout India regularly for work, so this is a comparison to a number of different, similar hotels.One caveat - upon checking out, the guys behind the counter told me that the &quot;credit card machine isn't working.&quot; After offering to get me a taxi to go to an ATM, I insisted on using my credit card, which of course, worked perfectly fine. Don't fall for this scam.Also - for the squeamish - the bathrooms, while clean, are very tight, and do not inspire... "
hotel singh sons ,"Value for money In India it's difficult to find a mid range hotel - this is just that. For the price the hotel is nice, en suite bathroom with hot water and western flushing toilet, A/C and clean rooms. There is internet in the lobby and the staff are helpful. The location is fine, there is a local market nearby at night and it's relatively close to Connaught Place. You can there in an auto for 50Rs. If you do go to Connaught Place then look out for Lido which is a very nice restaurant (with A/C) "
hotel singh sons ,"Wonderful for Delhi Stayed with my teen travel group for a couple nights.Showers were nice (hot and cold water), the staff were eager-to-please, and the AC was lovely and necessary :)This is India, it's a third-world-country, and this must be considered when a rating is given. You shouldn't come to Delhi expecting a US experience, because it won't happen, and you shouldn't want it to. "
hotel singh sons ,"Beware! We made an email booking for this hotel one month before our arrival in Delhi. We exchanged with Mr. Tajinder Singh at least 4 (four!) emails because we wanted to be sure of the booking. They assured us the booking was ok and they had the availability of rooms. Of course, when we arrived at the hotel, no booking was made on the hotel books and no room was available. No Tajinder Singh to speak with, only one guy at the reception that moved us in a very bad hotel in the same road: we payed 4.000 and more Rs for one bad room instead of the two rooms that we booked one month earlier!!If you don't want surprises like this at your arrival in Delhi, avoid email booking for this hotel, and maybe avoid this hotel at all. "
hotel singh sons ,"Clean accommodation. We arrived in the early hours of the morning and the pick up was excellent and welcome. No getting hassled. We were pleased to arrive at a clean, large hotel with reasonable facilities and ac. The bathroom was big and there was a shower and western toilet but no bath. We stayed for 3 nights.Positives: clean sheets, clean floors, cool rooms, no insects, efficient services, taxi pick up.Negatives: basic (very) breakfast, our room was on the road so you could hear the noise, cold/warm showers.Location: a rickshaw ride from the main centre (connaught place) so not a problem, nice restaurannt near by called alpha spice.Overall: for approx 30 uk pounds / night seems reasonable, our main priority was a clean hotel having read other reviews and horror stories of other hotels, it met our needs. The area is not the best but to be fair none of Delhi is particuarly much different. I would use common sense and ask for directions from your hotel - they are helpful. "
hotel singh sons ,"Not bad given price Stayed there as part of an Intrepid &quot;comfort&quot; tour to Agra. The hotel was reasonably clean and quiet. It's conveniently located in the Channa market section of Karol Bagh, about 1/2 mile from the subway. Seemed safe to walk around. This is not a &quot;first class&quot; hotel but we felt comfortable there.pagoff "
hotel singh sons ,"Singh Sons - A Decent Budget Hotel I stayed at Singh Sons for about three days in late February/early March with my family and my wife's family. Here is our collective review:- Pros - Singh Sons is a nice new hotel with a lot of nice marble everywhere (including all the lobbies and the stairs). The rooms are small and basic but very clean, as are the bathrooms which have Western style toilet seats. Some of the middle rooms do not have windows but all rooms have air conditioning. Also, the breakfast is quite nice - with pastries and eggs/omelettes in addition to tea/juices. The omelettes at Singh Sons are particular tasty! The room service is cheap and available around the clock. The location is central enough - with both the old part and new part of Delhi reachable on tempos (tuk-tuks).- Cons - I personally like the hustle and bustle of Karol Bagh where the hotel is situated but some people seem to have issues with this setting; however, I think you get more of a Delhi experience here although Singh Sons tends to be in a quieter part of Karol Bagh. Safety-wise, you should feel safe here since there are lot of other tourists who stay here. My main issue with the hotel is that because of the marble hallways, it can get noisy as people walk about at night. - Overall - this is a fairly good budget hotel overall for Delhi (outside Delhi, you can get a better hotel for the same price). And I would go with tour operators since they can get you the room about 20% cheaper than you can on your own. I used this reasonably priced one called Safe Voyages Tours run by a very honest Rajasthani guy - they have a website as well (you can google it). "
hotel singh sons ,"Bad Hotel in Bad Location The tour group I took had our accomodations at Hotel Singh Sons. Everyone of us hated the hotel and disliked the people there. I read the other review that said it was 10 months old - I'm shocked as it seemed much older. I had both the &quot;deluxe&quot; sweet and a normal room. The bathtub was coming out of one of the rooms such that I couldn't open the door. The people working the hotel also don't care about the guests - I think they get too much business from tour operators. Also, the location was awful. If you are travelling alone as a woman, or even two women - I would avoid staying in Karol Bagh - I tried walking alone in the morning and I turned back after 5 minutes. My India friends were suprised I stayed in the neighborhood as it is know for thievery and it's not safe.I can say the beds seemed clean enough. Avoid having a room near the lobby - it's very noisy. I loved India but Singh Sons was the low-light. "

hotel southern ,"Value for Money We booked this hotel at the last minute as our initial plans on lodging got messed up and I was not able to access Trip Advisor to read the reviews about the hotels in New Delhi. I was very skeptical while booking this hotel as I was accompanied with my whole family from Chennai to New Delhi and I want to ensure nothing more messes up with our plan.The Hotel from it’s outside gave us a not so good impression as it is fully surrounded by Shops and the Hotel is located in the Commercial area, however, after walking inside the room we felt that we have booked a decent and economical room in New Delhi. We were a family of 4 and the Hotel Staff was kind enough to accommodate all 4 of us in a Deluxe A/c Room for Rs. 3,500/- per night. The Hotel is located right near the Karol Bagh Market which is an added advantage for all bargainers in Shopping. They have a Andhra restaurant and the food was very good. Overall, we felt that this Hotel was value for money. "
hotel southern ,"Cheap - both in terms of rate and service I stayed with my wife and her parents for 3 nights at Southern Hotel. The rooms and the service were woefully bad. In the 3 nights we stayed my in-laws had to chang rooms thrice. The first night we were offered rooms in an extended block in a street nearby; the second night they were offered a room where the w/c flushes did not work properly and where there was no proper exhaust fans; finally on the last night of their departure, they were offered a good room. The rooms offered to us were also not of high standard. The rooms might have the latest television sets but the condition of the rooms and the bathrooms (including the finish) were substandard. Their travel desk, though manned by a couple of courteous staff, do have the odd disrespectable staff who managed to cause some aggravation. Their staff need more training on customer service. The private delhi city tour we had was also not upto the mark as the driver who also happened to be the guide did not know all the details about the places he was taking us to. In short, we had the most unpleasant stay at the hotel, though I do have to add that at the end, we were offered complimentary drops at the airport for the bad experience we had gone through (a decent gesture but surely not enough to compensate for the experience)This is a cheap hotel that will be reflected in the decor and service. If cost is paramount to you and if you don't mind the state of the rooms or the service, then fine. Otherwise, please steer well clear of this place. "
hotel southern ,"Feedback to Southern Hotels Delhi While booking a room online the pictures showed a different image than what i was faced with when i was allotted a room in the hotel.The room was shabby, with cracked walls and missing soft finish patches and the Bathroom was also stinking, definitely not a room worth Rs 1800 +. Also the Travel desk said that the car i had asked for in the night, would be ready in the morning and when i called in the morning to double check, i got a blunt answer that there are no vehicles available.The billing was also done incorrectly and had i not noticed that the clerk at the billing desk had charged me for a day, where in i had already paid for a day while booking the room online, i would have ended up paying double the price and that too for such a bad experience.

hotel southern ,"Collected It was difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in New Delhi that had some sort of track record. We finally took a chance and chose the Southern. Ok, its not the Oberoi Cecil but for the money and a very short stay it was fine. We were collected from the airport as agreed and taken to the railway station at 4.00am. They arranged a city tour, car and driver for 8 hrs Rs.750. All in all I think good value for money at £40.00 a night for a double room. Not the place to stay for more one or two nights. "
hotel southern ,"Delux Hotel offering great facility ! offering the ultimate hospitality, courtsey, great food, homely atmosphere, comfort, elegant furnishings ! My stay was really worth !! "
hotel southern ,"It was pleasant stay in Delhi. The hotel was centrally located and is ideal for tourists who proceed to pilgrimage circuits such as Char Dham etc. But please check out regarding the clause of free drop to Railway station as it is given in quotes &quot;subject to availability&quot;, and can put you in trouble if you depended on them as we faced trouble in the last moment. We had to hire a taxi from outside when the hotel did not provide us with the &quot;free drop&quot; and got away with this clause. "
hotel southern ,"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY BUSINESS TRAVELLER We booked the hotel through the website [-]. The pictures and the description is totally misleading. The hotel is spread over two buildings. We were given rooms in the adjoining building (which was a commercial building with shops on both sides). Only the top two floors of this building had hotel rooms. The restaurant, reception etc was all in the main building. We asked to be put in the main building but were told that there were no deluxe rooms in the main building. Imagine, having pass through the shops selling household items and travel agents to get to the breakfast table in the morning. As you can imagine, even a bottle of mineral water took 25 mins to arrive in the room. We were to call the reception and it took a lot of time for the service people just to get to our room. Also, as soon as you get out of the lift, you see bystanders/hawkers. We had a feeling that even our luggage was not safe.The food and the service in the restaurant was not at all good. The average wait time for the food to arrive after placing order is 45 mins to 1 hour. Also, no other good restaurants in the vicinity.The location is Karol Bagh but there is a shortage of Cabs/ rickshaws in the vicinity of the hotel.I would not recooment the hotel to any traveller.

hotel southern ,"Dont just go by the website I was less then happy when I turned up at about 1am to be taken to my rooms, I asked to see the rooms before I would take my cases to the rooms.When I saw the rooms which was a deluxe room I was not very happy bunny, so I went down and made it clear that if I am not given a better room at the same price then I would be going else where.I was then offerd two super deluxe rooms for the same rate as the deluxe but they wouldn't be available til the following night so we had to make do with the deluxe room for the first night.after the first night service was much better and my family and i enjoyed our stay "
hotel southern ,"Good value rooms for New Delhi ..., but the breakfast is pretty basic, with little western options.Make sure you get booking confirmation via email, as you may have problems we had at check-in as we booked via email with the hotel... (but they upgraded us to compensate). Have good travel agency next door so can book New Delhi tours or other trips around Delhi, and trains nationally.Rooms are good value and have good facilities for the price, providing you book the super deluxe and above tariffs... "
hotel southern ,"Absolutely no You can find something better for a bit more - so do. Internet pictures are from another era so don't be fooled by those. Once you get to your room, they are OK, but getting there is through a scary neighborhood - you leave the reception area to go down an unsecured alley. We arrived late, and they had switched our booking to a hotel down the street that was even more scary but it was 1 in the morning - so no place to complain. Staff is not very helpful - particularly the middle aged guy at the front desk. No nearby restaurants or shopping. Pay a little more and enjoy Delhi. Trip advisor has other recommended hotels - read the reviews and pay a bit more - how often are you in Delhi?? "
hotel southern ,"Only if you have to... The rooms were clean enough. However, having to go out to the street from the Check-in area to the rooms is scary in the middle of the night, especially given the run-down appearance of the neighborhood.The hotel offers complimentary pick-up for their more expensive rooms. I was pleasantly surprised that they sent a person to receive us. However, this turned to dismay as he called for the car after seeing us and it took about an hour and a half of waiting to get in a car. Sure enough, this delay meant that the hotel's restaurant was closed for the night - significant problem when traveling with a small child.Overall, I would not recommend this for families with kids if you are coming from the U.S. Probably more suitable for adults and adventure travelers. "
hotel southern ,"Not recommended- dirty and scary My husband and I had booked three nights at this hotel and left after one. We arrived in Delhi in the middle of the night and got to the hotel at around 4am. Next to the check-in desk there was a doorway covered in a sheet- behind it several people were sleeping on the floor. Our room was shabby and cramped, nothing like the pictures on the website. There were no towels and no toilet paper. The sheets didn't look clean and there was dirt in all of the corners. Random people were hanging around, walking up and down the hall all night and talking loudly. Worst was the foot-wide hole in the wall of the bathroom that opened into an airshaft. The sounds of other people's bathroom activities came in all night. We lay awake, trying to get some sleep, until 8am when we started calling other hotels. Thank goodness we found another hotel and got out of Hotel Southern by 9am. "

hotel southern ,"A little out of the way Not a bad hotel, in a bit of an odd location in Karol Bagh, but only a 5-10 min walk to the metro station which makes getting round quite easy. Definately spend the extra money for an executive suite, good sized room and nice bathroom, though zero view and relatively noisy outside. Saw the standard rooms, and they were 'cozy'. The complimentary airport pickup is a bonus, specially if its your first time in India, and they did show up...eventually! Food was quite good (complimentary breakfast not so good) from room service, nice curries, though the sag paneer was the most radioactive looking one I have ever seen!Staff friendly enough and willing to help, over all not a bad choice for a budget ish hotel in the relatively pricey Delhi "
hotel southern ,"Oh how deceiving pictures can be When I first pulled up outside this hotel in the taxi I had to triple-check the address, and ask the receptionist before being convinced that it was indeed the one I'd seen online. Put simply, the hotel in reality is absolutely nothing like what it's website portrays. Ok, so many of the streets in the Karol Bargh area are very grubby, albeiet quite a convenient central location, however the difference between what was promised online, and what I got more than warrants me writing this review. The hotel lobby looks impressive enough - especiallly considering the outside is a complete mess. The receptions was helpful enough. First problem - I'm told check-out time is 8:30am. I was told this previously on an email from them when I booked - when I told them I would choose a different hotel because of it they changed it to midday - when I arrived they knew nothing about this and said they would need to charge me.Guy takes me out into the street and up the most filthy alleyway which leads to an outside building that leads in turn to where my room is. I had booked the 'executive suite' - on first view the room looked ok - but once the door was shut, I had time to see how bad it was. The room was completely infested with cockroaches. Everywhere - running around the bed, the bathroom....I was simply too tired to consider changing hotels, so I decided to brave it out. I told reception to come and spray the room, they did, but this changed nothing.All in all, something to be very aware of - yes their website makes the place look very attractive - but it is very very misleading. Caveat Emptor "

The size of the room was small Was initially showed a standard room and was disgustedThe service at the resturant breakfast was rather laid back The breakfast menu was limiting Kaamat resturant is okay The desk service and butlers etc are quite good The New Delhi city tour that we with Southern did was wonderfulOverall, it may good if you are a local Indian Foreingers and NRI's you will be dissapointed, it does not meet international standards, its better to pay a little more and stay at a better hotel..

hotel southern ,"Overall average (maybe good for New Delhi) This review should be read with the understanding that while doing research for hotels in India, I was struck by the lack of agreement about the quality of different hotels. It seems there was no consistency in the reviews. I hate to add to the confusion but I can't rave about Hotel Southern like the other reviewers. This was our first trip to India and I imagine that among the other hotels in India, Hotel Southern is probably above average but I was not blown away. The positives of the hotel:1. The rooms (we had two different rooms on two different nights) were clean. Not immaculate but NOT gross.2. The hotel did have air conditioning and heat (we did use the heat in January. Initially, the heat was broke but the staff fixed it in about 90 minutes)3. The hotel was a reasonable value. I was not very impressed by the value of the Hotel Southern but it did provide a clean, okay location (most tourists stay near Conant Place) for a reasonable price. 4. The hotel is near (five minute walking) from the New Delhi metro system (this was an excellent way to avoid the pollution, traffic and inflated taxi prices tourists pay)5. The hotel had a complimentary breakfast (but I had to ask about it before the staff gave me vouchers; they were not given to me with my key at check-in, as most other hotels do) 6. The hotel offers a complimentary pick up from railway stations (and sometimes airports); although we tried to arrange this twice but neither time did any hotel staff pick us up. This was a big disappointment. The negatives of the hotel:1. The only negative that was that I felt the staff often did not go out of their way to help us. Failure to arrange transportation for us twice was a big let down. We asked the staff to call the airport to see if our flight was delayed. The staff member sent me to their travel desk where I was given the number but no one ever called for us. A Hotel with good service just make the call. Finally I had to ask about the complimentary breakfast and I demanded that for their failure to pick us up twice, they should give us a complimentary ride to the airport. Good hotel offers these to their guests; the guests do not have to ask. "
hotel southern ,"Great Place great service excellente in Delhi The Hotel has a great service, very clean and very good locatation. If you are thinking to travel to Delhi this is excellence choice. With a travel agency in the hotel you don't need to move around for prepare your routes in Delhi. "
hotel southern ,"Cockroaches and unreliable service I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights October. When I made my booking, the staff offered to pick me up from the airport and didn’t show. When I called them to ask about arranging a transfer they simply said they had no more cars and hung up in my ear. When we did arrive, the room had cockroaches. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. "

hotel sri nanak continental ,"Worst place to stay I was forced to stay in this hotel as i was coming from Manali with a small 4 year old child at 6.30 am.I checked into this hotel.The room rents are far too high for the amenities.The bed is placed on a carpet which has not been cleaned in the last one year.The hotel staff must rank as the most unfriendly and rude that I have encountered.They insisted i pay in cash or pay 2% more if I payed by card.They insisted that I pay more as i was checking in at 6.30 am in the morning.Hioweevr if you fight they would reluctently agree to not charge you anything extra.If you wanted an extra tea bag , I had to fight for it.

It is right in the middle of Karol Bagh and accessible to the main shopping areas. We really enjoyed our stay here. "

There was bath tub, and also separate shower panels which we enjoyed the most. We were also given complimentary soft beverages and free laundry service. The restaurants served delicious food. I would certainly recommend this hotel to all travelers in Delhi . "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Better stay away Sri Nanak Continental is situated in a rather shabby neighbourhood in New Delhi.We stayed in four different hotels on our trip, and Sri Nanak was by far the worst.We had booked a &quot;luxury room&quot;.- The room did not feature a safe (which was said to be included).- The A/C was old and very noisy, and it was not possible to leave it on when removing the room key to go out, making the room as hot as outside (+40 c).The staff tried to scam us when we asked for a hotel taxi to the local market. It was just a couple of blocks away, and they wanted Rs. 1500 (!!). When we declined the offer and left, they hurried back to us and offered a four hour sightseeing for rp.800 (which still is pretty expensive).We went to see some other parts of India, and left the hotel for five days. We asked to check out and get refund for the this period. The staff declined the refund, but wanted us badly to check out. We did not check out, as we needed the room for storage. So, in the meantime, while checked in, the staff removed our belongings from the hotel room and unplugged the refridgerator. When we got back, we had to ask the staff to get our stuff back. They had most likely rented our room out when we were gone. Very unprofessional!Positive remarks:- The hotel gave us free airport pick up.- They gave us three hour free internet access.- Liqour shop situated next to the hotel.- The food in the restaurant (other than the continental breakfast) was OK.Note:The internet at the hotel must be authenticated through a web frontend. This page does not work with Opera Mini or the standard Nokia web browser.Summary:Unprofessional and dubious staff. Stay away from this hotel. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Pretty poor might be ok value for money. Me and some friends stayed at this hotel when visiting India recently and here are my impressions:Rooms: Size is somewhat small, but in my opinion not really that bad. The main room seemed clean enough, but the bathroom was a disaster. A very dirty floor, somewhat smelly, and stains in the toilet (not excrements, but the kind you get if you never clean it). Towels and bedsheets were clean.Hygene supplies like soap, shampoo, shaver, shower scrub and tooth brush/paste were all included, but the empty/used ones wasn't always replaced unless we asked for it.Air Condition machines were noisy but worked ok.Staff: Rather unfriendly and not too service-minded. They also seemed very helpless when it came to things that are not in their daily routine. For example, when cheking out, they insisted my card was being declined. When I looked at the display on the card reader it said &quot;check phone no&quot;. I told them that it was probably not a card problem, but a connection problem, yet they insisted it was my card that didn't work and demanded I go get some cash. After some nagging, I got them to wiggle a bit on the phone connector, and hey presto, it worked.As usual, when checking out, you have to fight the staff to roll your own suitcase yourself the three meters from your room to the lift. If they get to you they'll also cram themselves together with you and your luggage in the already small elevator, not matter how much you tell them you can do it yourself. Totally unnecessary in my opinion. No tip!When we asked the hotel taxi for a 8 km ride they wanted 1500 rupees. We just turned our back to leave, and suddenly we got a better (not good, but better) deal. (Four hours free driving for 800 rs) Dissapointing that they first tried to hustle us like that.The two friends I traveled with had prepaid their room, and when we went for a unplanned trip we told the staff we would leave for a few days. As my friends could not get a refund (the staff didn't even want to try, they just repeated &quot;not refundable as in the agreement&quot;) my friends didn't check out for the small trip. When we came back, their belongings were removed from their room. Though they got them back, it seems the room was rented out in the meantime.Food: The best thing about the hotel. The restaurant has some great Indian dishes. But stay away from the continental breakfast!Internet: Provided by wifi, but unfortunately user authorized by a somewhat dodgy web solution that doesn't work in all browsers, so you might not be able to use your smart phone.

hotel sri nanak continental ,"Poor organization I went to India with my wife for sightseen, this country has many things to see and Taj Mahal is defenitively the best of the seven wonders. We were hosted in Hotel Sri Nanak Continental and from my point of view this hotel has a weak organization.We had the next problems due poor organization1.- I requested pick up service in the airport, we were waiting for 30 minutes, and taxi never arrives, finally we decided to go by ourself to hotel.2.- Even though there is a questionaire to feed back about problems with infrastructure and service, it seem they didnt read it, air conditioner is very noisy, almost impossible to sleep, but with a temperature in summer of 40°C obviously is necessary3.- Room cleaning can be drastically improved.4.- We bought a 3 days-tour to Agra and Jaipur in travel desk of same hotel, I explained them due we were not using the room during 2 nights I must not pay this, but responsible explained me this is a hotel policy and that I had to pay this 2 nights and additional hotel in Agra and Jaipur. 5.- The street is very noisy and rooms are not designed to have a quiet enviroment.I recommend to look for different option, there are better hotels in Delhi at same price.

hotel sri nanak continental ,"Horrible horrible place-will not stay here ever again! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. My husband booked this place because it was shown as a top value hotel on Trip advisor! the location is not that great. but that was not our main problem. when we arrived at the hotel after a long flight, the staff were very rude and extremely lazy.. hey took about half hour to check us in and the service was really really bad. finally we were taken to the room. It is extremely small. Although they had provided a big collection of supplies for bathroom etc. I was impressed with the LCD TV bcos overally the hotel looked quite horrible! The bathroom was the worst. It smelt of cigarettes and I was not sure if they had actually cleaned the bathrooms before we arrived. Five minutes after we checked into the hotel, we were asked to come down to the reception with our passports. As we were planning to go and watch a movie, my husband and I went downstairs. We were met by two police officers in civil clothes. They started asking us many questions as to where we work etc. We were questioned for a good ten minutes. They became very nice to us after they found out where my husband and I were working and apologised to us. When we asked why they wanted to question us they told us that it was arountine checking as the indian independance day was coming soon, that we were the only guests in our rooms and because we were originally from a south asian country! I was quite angry, even thought the police officers were eventually very nice to us. we had no idea why they wanted to check us and we were quite suspicious because both the police officers who had come to check us spoke our mother tongue which is not that often used in north india.. what made us even more angrier was that the front office staff did not even apologise to us or even explain why were being questioned.. My husband and I have stayed in many places as we go on holidays once a month and this hotel was the worst that I had stayed in.. My husband and I actually had an argguement because I was complaining the whole evening about this hotel :).. I have no idea why this hotel is shown as a top value hotel in trip advisor as there are many many more nicer hotels. I will not stay here again and I will not recommend it to anyone!! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,small but convenient Small hotel but neat.. good for stay if you going for shopping in that area of delhi 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Nice experience.... The hotel &amp; services were very much helpfull to me as I was the first time visitor to Delhi. I felt very easy to move to see various places in and around Delhi. They had a very good trip assistance, loyal drivers with cab took me to Haridwar+ Rishikesh+ Tajmahal.Rooms &amp; Services were satisfactory. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"AVOID !!! DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL The room was very small and unpleasent. Very DIRTY. Unable to sleep due to a loud noise from the street till 4 am. No hot water at bathroom. On arrival we were told that breakfast is included, but on checkout we charged 600 rhp for breakfast. The breakfast was very poor, and the service poor as well. The train station is about 10 minutes walk, in an unpleasant area. The hotel location is faraway from the tourists' attraction, and the area don't look safe at evening time. The A/C was very noisy, and hardly worked, so the room was hot.It was the worst hotel we had in India. I would not stay there again. I do NOT recommend this hotel. It was a very bad experience. I can not understand the other review. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Overall stay was unpleasant though some staff were nice. I only stayed for one night and left quickly the next morning to tour a bit of Delhi and catch a train to Agra in the afternoon. The rooms were ok, but not very clean. My towels were dirty and phone didn't work, so I had to move rooms right away. I can't say much about the location as I didn't explore much, but it is on a very busy narrow street filled with mopeds, fruit stands, and liveliness. Wouldn't recommend walking around solo after dusk but if you are 2 or more, you'd probably be ok. FYI -Breakfast was not included since I booked online. I would not stay there again or recommend this hotel.Additionally - When I arrived, I coordinated a car for the next day which was a bit of an ordeal, but worked out fine. Just beware of the 80 kilometer limit, which I exceeded easily (they charge 7 rupees each additional kilometer - which I actually don't think is terrible, just that you will like go over the limit.) Also, the driver tried to tack on an extra 20 more for not dropping me off back at the hotel or something, even though I had arranged to end the day at the train station. That was annoying and obviously not well communicated. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"brilliant service we had a short stay at this hotel and would fully recommend it to anyone. The train station is very near and in the middle of a vibrant area. The service was very good, Bunty the taxi driver was great and very helpful . Food was very good and will definately stay again. For a good quality cheap hotel i would stay here. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"nice family run hotel I being a business traveler very often come to new delhi . I booked this hotel via a travel agent and it turned out to be a very decent choice .

hotel sri nanak continental ,"Unlikely to go back For me, getting a good nights sleep and having good washing facilities are the most important reasons for staying in a hotel. Sadly this hotel failed on both counts. The room was tiny with old style A.C. unit which allowed all the outside noise to come through, making it impossible to sleep. The shower had a very poor water flow, not enough have a decent wash. And if you arrive early, like we did, they will charge you for an extra night. If you want to stay up all night and go without a wash, be their guest. Definitely not for us again. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Much More than Expected We being an old couple wanted a neat room &amp; a secure place to stay. After spending numerous hours searching for the hotel on the internet we decided to stay at Sri Nanak. There are endless options in the internet but you realize the difference only when you arrive at the hotel .We had booked the hotel directly to get a good deal, and the reply was prompt . We stayed in a executive room which was a newly renovated rooms &amp; later upgraded us to a suite room since they had empty rooms which was a nice gesture. It had nice LCD TV and very clean white linen which is uncommon for hotels in delhi in this price bracket. Rooms had all things which you can expect from a 4 * hotel. We were satisfied with the staff who helped us at all times. Also the hotel has a travel desk in which we went for a same day agra tour * delhi local tour which all went perfect. Overall i would like to recommend this hotel to all travelers as I like sharing my opinion so that others can benefit.Also the hotel Wi-Fi Service was very fast &amp; the best part it was free. They also have a desktop machines in case you do not have a laptop . &quot;&quot; "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Family Traveller44 This was my first visit to New Delhi, I always book my hotel through Travel Agent but this time I book my hotel through internet. As I have seen many reviews in trip-advisor about this hotel so we decide to stay in this hotel &amp; book a room through the hotel website. I requested the hotel to give me the discount but they refuse to give me the discount and they offer me Free Airport pickup with complimentary breakfast. So we finally decide to book this hotel. The hotel arranged nice luxury car to pickup my family as I was coming from Singapore late night. The hotel was located in crowded area Karol Bagh so we feel safe there to stay. Hotel Sri Nanak was nice, clean &amp; comfortable as my daughter is very particular about the cleanliness of the bathroom but she was happy as there was shower panel in the bathroom with 6 nozzles as never expected in such kind of hotels. The hotel room was small but they have all facilities which we can never think in small luxury hotel as I have stayed in many hotels in India. I will recommend other family travelers to stay in this hotel as the atmosphere of the hotel looks like home. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Very Noisy Overpriced Stayed for a night. The room was very noisy for 2 reasons:1. A/C was rumbling like it was about the explode. Had to switch it off eventually because I got really worried. 2. There was some night-long celebration where there was chanting/singing in the street outside (not the Hotel's fault, but still makes it difficult to sleep).Free wireless internet was good. They also give free newspapers which I did not expect from a budget hotel. Hotel staff were also reasonably helpful. While no complaints apart from the noise, the overall hotel service is not spectacular either to merit the price they are charging for. "

hotel sri nanak continental ,"No problems but overpriced I stayed here three nights and had absolutely no problems, but the price of 2590 rupees is simply too high for this kind of accommodation. You can get a similar room at Cottage Yes Please for 900/night (and I would have done so, except Yes Please was full at that time). The only real difference in service and quality that I can think of was that Sri Nanak left a newspaper outside my door every morning.The location is a bit noisy. There is a Gurudwara down the street and they broadcast prayers quite loudly at certain times during the day and evening. All around the hotel there are automotive-type shops with lots of motorbikes and the place is really grimy, especially the air. You can see the haze in the air just looking down the street.The main reason I paid this much was for the free WiFi, which I needed for my work. But there are probably other, cheaper options available. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Great stay We had very nice time at this hotel,Rooms, staff , internet , clealiness all was very good, we very much enjoyed our stay. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Mixed Feelings Staying at the Sri Nanak Continental for two nights on my first trip to Delhi, I cannot compare it to other accomodations - but you get the impression that the prices of all mid-range hotels are somehow inflated. The good thing about the Hotel is the rather quiet location (at least for the Karol Bagh district). Most taxi drivers will have to ask a couple of times (and may not be able to read the hotel sign or the address on your reservation...). The room was more less clean, but a strange selection of new and old (well used) furniture. The rooms seem to differ very much, some with new flat screen TVs and bathrooms, some with quite old installations.The rooftop restaurant produced surprisingly good dishes, though the ordering process revealed some communication problems now and then.The check in took quite long, Minibar and Taxi had to be paid in cash. The service was efficient, however, and wakeup call and ordered taxi were on time. The hotel also offers to store some luggage, e.g. if you leave for a round trip for a couple of days. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Not impressed I'm afraid I have to say I was not at all impressed with having paid nearly $200 for 2 nights in this hotel.When I arrived my room was not clean, there were gecko droppings in the bathroom, the sheets were dusty, half a bottle of the previous occupant's shampoo was in the room, the kettle did not work and there were the remnants of the previous sachets of coffee from the last occupant, but no replacement sachets. The milk powder sachets were also 8 months past the 'best before' date and it is recommended not to drink them after this date.The following day (today) I had to make many requests - for replacement sachets of coffee, for a new kettle and, when no one had come to clean my room by the afternoon, I requested it was cleaned. This was done quite reluctantly. I still received no replacement coffee sachets.The staff were very polite and have good manners and the reception desk were very helpful in providing me with maps, information re shops and other matters.However, there does need to be some improvement in the management of the hotel domestic standards. They are not what I would expect from a 3 star Hotel.If I had paid $30 per night and this hotel was either a 1 or 0 star, I would have been happy, as it comes under the no frills budget category. However, it is far far removed from the advert on the site and not worth the amount of money I spent on it. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,not a good place The worst hotel we stayed in India. The staff was not friendly at all.When we asked to pay in euros they tried to cheat us in calculating the chage rates...The room was dirty and we had to keep close the bathroom door due to the smell...The resturant is fine even if the service was very slow. 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Great budget place but beware of the tourist operators attahced to the hotel If you are looking for a good budget hotel then Nanak is a great choice in Delhi. It's location is not the best, especially since it is tucked into a narrow street which was not really car-friendly. Service at the hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean but the bathroom shower curtains could be better. The food at the restaurant was good and we had no complaints. My only complaint during the duration of our stay was the travel agency attached to the hotel. They were ridiculously overpriced, and the drivers who took us back to New Delhi railway station were outright impolite and did not care about the fact that it was raining and that we did not want to wade in a pool of water to get to the entrance of the station. All they were worried about was that we had to pay Rs. 100 more for the A/C. On the second day of our stay we took a tour of Delhi and the driver was reluctant to take us to many places saying that it was too crowded. It looked like we were traveling with his comfort in mind.PLEASE BEWARE ABOUT THESE TOURIST OPERATORS. You would be better off if you can arrange your Delhi tours with another travel agency. I called Mr. Karan Khandelwal of the hotel and he promised to look into this matter and was very apologetic but I never got a call back or an email regarding this. Overall the hotel was a pleasant experience with the only blot being the tourist operators. I would recommend the place otherwise. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Would recommend it … Enroute home I had some dead time in Delhi on August 1. As I was travelling with two young kids, some decent lodging to have a nap and shower, was imperative. I booked this hotel by directly contacting the property through email. They offered me a room for INR 1500 for 8 hours, everything included except transfer. I thought INR 1500 was not a bad deal and thus consented to the offer. The room was clean and worth its price. Bathroom was of good standard to be a budget hotel in India, toiletries of acceptable quality. Wifi was ok. As far as location is considered, it all depends upon what you are looking for. If you are out to enjoy the true hustle bustle of India, it is a perfect choice … congested, mainstream India with all its salient features. But if you are allergic of crowd, hullaballoo and wanted to have something silent and calm, avoid this hotel … rather avoid the locality Karol Bagh altogether. The hotel asks for INR 700 for a taxi to the airport, which is quite unreasonable. Air-conditioned radio taxi would cost at the most INR 450. Of course, there are much better alternatives. However, in short, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking something in this price class. A general tip: Try as far as practically possible, have your deals in writing, explicitly mentioning what it includes and what it doesn’t. Otherwise, you will be bitterly surprised at the end. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"A Nice Budget Alternative First of all, it should be clear to visitors that we are talking about budget alternative not a property in luxury segment. Thus, it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect everything at its best. Taking the rates in account I would say … 1. Hotel rooms are adequately clean. 2. Toilet/bathroom = above average3. Maharaja suit could be a nice option for families travelling with young kids and tight budget. Location is not the ideal one … but not that bad either. Conclusion: Honestly speaking Sri Nanak deserves better rating than the one it currently holds (27). "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Cosy Little Hotel The Sri Nanak is a cozy place in a busy Delhi location. It's not within walking distance of much, but you'll feel like you're in real Delhi.We stayed here twice, and had a different room each time. The two rooms we had were both comfortable and clean, but one room was definitely more recently renovated in than the other.On Christmas Day, we were treated to a free simple dinner in the restaurant upstairs.Practicalities:Free internet access from a computer terminal. There are small grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants nearby. The hotel staff is courteous and responsive to needs. The hotel also felt safe. Get detailed instructions on how to get to the hotel because taxi drivers seem to have difficulty finding it. Overall, great for the price. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Comfortable Stay Though I stayed at the hotel just for a night, I found the hotel very comfortable and peaceful. The interior of the hotel room was very good. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, Karol Bagh. The staff was very co-operative and helpful. I would certainly recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Excellent Stay I stayed with Hotel Sri Nanak in March 08. The hotel was great, the services was just too great. The Owner sandeep was great too, he had a dinner with us and that was complimentary. The Manager were very helpful in providing information about the city which was quite handy ! We had our Laptops , we could browse High Speed Wi-Fi which was quite useful . Also if you are not carrying the notebook then the hotel provides free access to desktops. The Food at the restaurant was great serving excellent chicken tikka masala (I like spicy food). The food was just too good to resist! The rooms have been nicely decorated &amp; very clean. The bathroom was equipped with latest amenities and the rooms were just amazing. There is a nicely decorated lobby in the basement where you can shop too. I bought a lovely pair of elephants. Over all my stay at the hotel was great &amp; it's a good deal to be here! If you are in Delhi, grab a room here.Happy traveling to all! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"clean cheap free wi-fi The hotel offered to pick me up from the airport, for 800 Rupees. I arranged a taxi at the airport for 250 Rupees, but took the driver a long time to find the hotel. I would recommend you have a map and give the driver directions.The location is a few minutes walk from several lively street markets and the metro station is within 10 minutes walk.The room was small, basically furnished and reasonably clean. The staff are very helpful.A good value hotel for Delhi. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Excellent location grat staff I chose Sri Nanak hotel for 2 reasons: the location (it is nearby the place I needed to go to for business) and the reviews about the staff. When in a new city it is always best to have reliable local information. My expections were infact exceeded.The hotel is clean and provides a more than average service for the Indian standards of a 3 star. But the people at the reception were outstanding. They helped me organize my days in such a way that I managed to perfectly combine busines and tourism. Transport was just perfect, including the pick up at the airport.But a special note is for the restaurant: I had the most enjoyable indian food; not the usual tourist stuff, but authentic indian cuisine in a very friendly environment.I will for sure come back the next times I will be in Delhi. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Mixed feelings This was our first trip to India and our first stay in this hotel. To me it bore no resemblance to the lavish reviews I've read on this site, but it was clean and things worked. I was charged 700 rupees for a &quot;complimentary&quot; pickup from the airport, but I must blame myself as I had forgotten that the pickup was supposed to be free. The location is awful, but perhaps the rest of Delhi is like that (we only went from the airport to the hotel and back). There was also some problem with the online reservation payment gateway and if I hadn't checked the total would have paid about twice what I was supposed to. I don't know quite how to rate this hotel as I haven't seen others in Delhi, but I certainly don't think the hotel deserves the praise some reviewers have cast on it. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Good for occasional night's stay We spent 4 nights, in 2 stays, during March, in different rooms. The rooms are small, with little storage space, but clean, the bed firm but adequate. The air con worked but was noisy, the fridge didn't work. The bathroom is a 'wet room' so take your thongs/flip-flops, but there was hot water. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful. Unless they already know where it is, taxis won't be able to find it - it's buried in the 'motor-cycle repair' section of the bazaar. But they will be able to find the gurdwara: the hotel is very close - if the gurdwara is on your LHS, turn R for 1 block, &amp; vise versa. Alternatively, arrange for the hotel to send a car to meet you at the station or airport. The dining room on the top floor is not very attractive, although an Indian family had a birthday party there - good sign. Be careful of the food - my wife had a dose of salmonella 2 days after we left &amp; is convinced it was from a re-heated veg biryani she had there. In summary, it's OK for an occasional night's stay, if you're prepared to live out of your suitcase, &amp; it's inexpensive. For some reason they wouldn't take a CR card for payment but insisted on cash. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Great hotel great family I had an excellent stay at Hotel Sri Nanak. I was in India for one month doing volunteer work and stayed at the hotel the entire time. The family that owns the hotel was very helpful and even gave us a deal because we stayed for such a long time. Anything we needed, they tried their best to get. The power went off about once a day, but luckily, the hotel had a generator that kicked on and kept the air conditioning and lights running. All the staff was very friendly and helped us out with what we needed in terms of directions. Really, this is a comfortable, friendly, Indian run place. They do what they can to make their guests happy and comfortable. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"overpriced for location My partner and I arrived early in the morning. We had given them details of our flight by email couple of days before but nobody picked us up. Wasn't such a big deal as the pre-paid taxi was handy at the airport.When we arrived, they didn't have any room for us and we believed it might have been some communication problem. We were totally exhausted, so we took their suggestion of staying in their staff's room for a few hours until one of their guests checked out later that morning. Reception guy was very polite, helpful and friendly.Anyway, we believe that for the location and the quality of the suite we stayed, it was overpriced. We stayed our next nights at another hotel in Paharganj, half their price and a little higher quality!I would recommend travellers to stay in Paharganj area, which is very close to metro station, much cheaper and more interesting! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Very Average Beware of Noise Picked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. To sum it up, we got what we paid for. The restaurant on top had very average food. The hotel rooms were very average. After reading the reviews, I expected the hotel to be noisy. and it was VERY noisy. I must have woken up 3 or 4 times in the night/early morning. The noise from the street is just insane. Its almost as if there is no glass. As for the staff, they were very helpful and courteous. As for the location, I would not recommend any single women travellers to stay in this hotel. The area isn't bad, but it sure as heck ain't safe. As the manager said, this is the oldest part of New Delhi.In the end, if you want average, this is it. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Hard to find a good hotel in New Delhi We booked three rooms and stayed six nights while we were attending a conference in January 2008. Prior to leaving I asked five of the hotels I had previously stayed at (Ashok, Taj Mahal, Oberoi, Meriden, and Claridges) to quote a price for four rooms for six nights, including all taxes, I do not know if it was the time of year but all came back with quotes in excess of $10,000 and one was not sure they could fit us in! If you are looking at the Hotel Sri Nanak Continental you are probably having the same problem, finding a good clean hotel in New Delhi. I use Google Earth and the Hotel Sri Nanak was shown as located in New Delhi close to our meeting at the Dr. Kothari conference center. I sent an email to the hotel to book the rooms and stated that it was selected based on its location. I am a regular visitor to India and know my way around New Delhi although I had not been there in over 10 years. The Hotel Sri Nanak Continental is not in New Delhi but in Old Delhi and its ranking of 22 of 215 hotels in New Delhi is more a reflection of the sever lack of good hotels. As one of our first time visitors to India put it “a one star hotel on the fringe of the ghetto” he had never seen an Indian ghetto so he is probably overly harsh.The location “mistake” was not a mistake but I am glad to report that it has now been corrected. India is known for its entrepreneurship and rather than take offense on what appears to be borderline dishonesty it is better to take in your stride and get the problem fixed. The hotel did pick us up at the airport in a good car, the hotel is in a dirty part of town but I believe it to be safe. The trip they arranged for Agra went well and the hotel taxi driver was made to cough up what he overcharged due to lack of change! Finally the grey towels were eventually replaced by clean white towels. One of our party had money stolen from stored luggage despite the “security” but it is not a good idea to leave money in luggage anywhere in the world.All in all probably somewhat overpriced for the location and condition of the rooms but you may want to consider negotiating and on the up side, despite its basic appearance the restaurant is great.My advice to the owners: Keep your laundry clean and fix up the roof area so guests have somewhere to sit. My advice to guests – welcome to India, keep your cash safe and go with the flow. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,Great Presidential room The presidential suite is amazing! great service and accommodation! 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Friendly I booked this hotel through internet. We were there for our first business trip. Upon arrival, I was surprised that the check in was still traditional way of recording but with security camera in place. The food is fantastic and the staff is always smiling. The room is clean too. What is important is I have free broadband internet. It's a nice place to rest at the heart of busy shop houses.Alvin, Singapore "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"I didnt like it After extensive research on the web, Sri Nanak seemed to be the best bet, but I was really disappointed. My biggest problem was that the rooms were really dusty, I was constantly sneezing and wiping my nose. My 2nd gripe was that the bathroom was a disaster. I cant understand why they dont use a separator between the shower and toilet. So the end effect is that after a shower the entire bathroom is wet !. Its a pity... this could be a really decent place if only they took the time to clean it !On the plus side the staff were helpful, although did raise your suspicions sometime. However overall they did help me with train ticket bookings and taxi service. Another plus is that they pick you up from the airport, which is a real help since you will inevitably get ripped off by a local taxi driver. As for location, its a bit run-down, but then thats India for you. Another plus is that its close to the Delhi Metro (which is excellent), and there are some shopping arcades in walking distance. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Great place to begin and end your journey to India We traveled to India as a family of six, with four under the age of eighteen. We flew into Delhi and Sri Nanak Hotel was waiting for us - even though our flight was delayed more than two hours in the middle of the night. What service! The hotel staff was friendly, supportive and helped us acclimate from the USA to India. Mr. Sandeep and Mr. Karan were particularly helpful. They made sure all of our needs were addressed. They arranged for transportation to the Taj, to our friend's house in Delhi, and to the airports as we traveled. We came back to this hotel after more than two weeks in country. We stayed in several hotels, and this had the best service, good food, clean accomodations and excellent management and staff. When we come to India in the future this will be our first and last stop. I give Sri Nanak my highest recommendation - a value for the money, and a welcome respite from the busyness of Delhi. Hats off to Mr. Sandeep and Mr. Karan! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"This is Not a Luxury Hotel It's similar to a Motel 8 in the US I picked this hotel based on the reviews and the price, but of all of the hotels I stayed at during my month long India trip, I thought this one was the one that I like least. I stayed in the best room they had and did not think that it was worth the price I paid. I'll update my review with pictures when I can get the pics uploaded. The bed was not comfortable and though the linens looked clean. The bathroom was an average hotel in India bathroom (no bathtub, shower with a bucket and a sink and toilet). The location of the hotel was not good. There was constant noise from the street: cats fighting, dogs fighting, cars honking, engines roaring...the pics I have of the street show how unideal the location really is... If the hotel was priced for the best room at $50 USD/per night, I think it would be a fair price. This hotel should definitely not be charging over $100. On a positive note, the staff seemed helpful and the elevator works. Unfortunately, since I didn't stay in other Delhi hotels, I can't recommend others. I did stay in many hotels on the Golden Triangle Route and can recommend those for the review in the those areas. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Terrible stay away Ever wonder why this seems to be one of the few places that seems to have plenty of rooms on short notice? It's because they will take your reservation and then move you on to a different hotel of their choice, even if you personally emailed with them to confirm a reservation made via a website.I arrived here after a long haul flight, quite late in the evening only to discover they had moved me to a different hotel. The room there was fine, even though the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water. Moreover it was located in the middle of the motorcycle repair district of a market. I probably do not need to elaborate on the amount of noise large numbers of bikes make in the morning...I very much recommend AGAINST booking a room at this hotel. You won't end up there anyway, and will just have to go through a lot of hasle to get your original booking fee refunded. (evidently, I ended up paying the other hotel) "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Noisy busy surroundings Hotel kindly arranged a pick up from the Airport, got in at approx 0130 am. The hotel is located in a very busy market place and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting a gentle introduction to Delhi following a long plane journey. Hotel was clean, but the location spoilt the experience. It's the only place where I had to get out of my Tuk Tuk and walk back to the hotel due to gridlocked traffic. Anyone who doesn't like barking dogs or call to prayer early morning should avoid.Staff were indifferent, the only place where no-one wanted to discuss the India-Pakistan cricket game underway.Best avoided unless you can't get anywhere else or are particularly interested in import export from the surrounding commerce... "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Good enough It took me a long time to decide upon Hotel Sri Nanak Continental as my destination upon arrival in New Delhi. As some other reviewers have noted, there seems to be a dearth of true mid-range lodging in Delhi. In many cases it is necessary to spend a small fortune to get what might be considered a moderate hotel in other places. I made my reservation at the Sri Nanak Continental and upgraded (paid, not complimentary) to a suite. My first experience was with the airport pickup. I walked through the arrivals area and saw many drivers with signs, but I didn't see my name on any of them. Since my flight had arrived about 20 minutes early (!) I decided to wait a few minutes before getting worried. I waited a little over an hour before calling the hotel. It turned out that the driver was waiting for me outside instead of inside the arrivals hall. It was fine that he was there, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that he would be outside and not inside. Once we met up, though, all went well getting to the hotel. Check-in went quite smoothly. I was able to grab a quick bite to eat in the restaurant. That was the only meal I had there - it was adequate....not great, not bad. The restaurant itself is a little on the dismal side....no windows and rather dark. My room was nice enough - it was certainly clean. It seemed to take a long time for the water to get hot. The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of stations on the flatscreen TV. I didn't see what a standard room looked like, but the suite had a small sitting area adjacent to the bed. It was like a standard room in a US chain such as a Comfort Inn - not a separate sitting room. The staff was courteous enough with the exception of a bellman who attempted to become a little too familiar with me (a solo woman) and then made some insulting remarks. The neighborhood is very congested and noisy, but the metro is at a convenient distance - maybe 10 minutes walking. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Overcharging Delhi Hotel We have just returned from a 10 day stay in India. Unfortunately had to stay at the Sri nanak Continental in Delhi.Firstly the free Airport pick up came, late, with 1 car for 7 pasengers plus luggage. Had to wait almost an hour while they sorted out a Taxi.I had booked the most expensive 3 rooms they had. A large room was shown to us , which was not clean or tidy. they then showed us other rooms and we chose a much smaller room, which was just about bearable, Didnt realise that the bed was so hard as if there was no mattress, The pillows stank, the bedsheet was dirty, so had to have the sheets and pillow covers changed and the room cleaned. The dirty dusty windows of the room did not shut properly so spent 2 sleepless noisy nights.Do not ask them to get a Taxi as theirs is about 5 times as expensive, there is a taxi rank around the corner, about 3 minutes walk with cheap taxis.I saw 2 people check out, first one complaining about overcharging, second one about extra charges for Mini Bar. When I checked out they charged me for the large room although I stayed at the cheapest room, after complaing the manager cancelled a £4 food bill but not the £20 extra for the room. Then charged me for 3 nights, as a mistake, but refunded the 3rd night.The staff were helpful at all times, The restaurant is actually a cafe and the food was good. There is also free internet at all times and location is good for shopping.I would not stay again or recommend this hotel "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Clean Enough Erratic Service Noisy Neighborhood We searched a great deal online to find this hotel in Delhi. Dismayed by the high prices and very negative reviews of many low-middle range hotels, we were attracted by this hotel's excellent web site, fairly reasonable prices, and offers of amenities. We also liked that they offered a courtesy pick-up from the airport, especially given the location of the airport. Unfortunately, although we had sent emails and called the hotel to book a reservation (pre-paying online, as they require) clearly requesting airport pick-up and listing flight number and exact times, no one was waiting to pick us up when we arrived at the Delhi airport. We called only to find out that they had forgotten to send someone (even though we were reportedly on the pick-up schedule). They didn't admit this at first, though- saying that the driver was &quot;on the way&quot; and &quot;stuck in traffic,&quot; and would be there in twenty minutes or so. They suggested we wait by the cafe stall outside the airport, and we were only to happy to do so. We had a coffee and tasty snack... Twenty minutes passed... thirty minutes passed... My husband kept calling to see what had happened to the driver, only to be told repeatedly how close they were. We didn’t want to make a nuisance of ourselves but were concerned that we might be in the wrong place or the driver might have overlooked us somehow, especially when we were initially told it would be much less time. We waited an hour and had just about given up when finally our &quot;person&quot; arrived with a name placard. He apologized profusely and was very polite, cheerful, and communicative, which we appreciated. After a long drive (due to the heavy Delhi traffic), we finally arrived at the rather sketchy area where the Hotel Sri Nanak is located- and were greeted with apologies. In this situation I think a concrete gesture such as a complimentary fruit plate or room upgrade (if they wanted to be extravagant) to make amends would have been a nice gesture, but no conciliatory gestures were made. Hotel elevator is claustrophobic with screen gate- I preferred the stairs. Nice attention paid to decorating the hallway with a pleasant statue (possibly Ganesh) and flowers. Our room (306- I think) was adequately clean, and although the furnishings and décor was a bit dated, it was fairly represented on the web site. The “headstand” of the bed looks more dreary in person than it does in photos. There was a nice flat screen tv with the usual lineup of Indian channels, news, and two movie channels. We were on the third floor overlooking a dismal alley and there was a fair amount of noise that came in the air vents. Traffic noise was heavy, and the alley also was busy with the activity of people centered on a street bonfire as well as packs of wild dogs that woke us up howling in the middle of the night. Ear plugs are a must. Not the hotel’s fault, but something to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper. The bathroom is quite cramped, and the water takes a while to heat up, but it does heat up eventually. Another thing I found strange was although there was toilet paper, the toilet paper bin was kept in the main bedroom- making it almost impossible to do anything but flush your paper. The soap provided by the hotel was quite harsh. The bedding was clean, and the floor was clean enough for bare feet, which was nice. By the time we got to our room we only had 30 minutes before the room service menu closed, so we made a quick order of veg. indian dishes. The food was ok, if not spectacular. We never had the opportunity to try the breakfast as our flights left too early in the morning. (Unfortunate, because a small snack and coffee would have really helped us get through our travels). The next morning as we were checking out, we told the management we’d had specific items from the room bar (water, chips). They tried to charge us for a coffee we hadn’t had (the bar was stocked with 1, not 2 coffees when we checked in, but we didn’t know it was normally stocked with 2 coffee until our visit a night later), and finally backed down when we insisted we had not had it- an inconsequential matter, but made us feel rather unpleasant. We stayed at the same hotel after our trip to Agra and this time were put in a more dreary room without a mini bar- we didn’t especially care about the mini bar issue, but the room smelled like garbage (rm. 204) so we requested to be transferred to our previous room and were accommodated. As we got settled in, we were interrupted by the staff several times- returning passports, presenting us with a wet bar inventory which we confirmed and initialed (a good idea but felt somewhat insulting- as if they still thought we’d stolen a can of coffee!), among other things. We visited the upstairs “restaurant” and found it to be a dark, windowless room, decently decorated, with what seemed to be a computer with internet access (being used by two other guests). We might have stayed and eaten there, but the restaurant host was so cool to us that we didn’t feel comfortable and went back to our room to order the same food via. room service. We had also been unclear that while airport pickup service is complimentary (in theory, if you don’t mind waiting for them), airport return service is not, and in fact costs an additional 500 rs. to the domestic terminal and a whopping 750 rs. to the international airport. Our early morning driver to the airport did not speak to us- not a huge deal but again, not something that left us with warm feelings about our overall experience. Also note, you will be expected to pay the tax for your bill and cab fare to the hotel lobby in cash, which meant we ended up at the Delhi airport with 35 rs. to our name. (The one ATM at domestic was out of order, and no food stations in the airport accept credit cards so we went without breakfast). I think that the hotel situation in Delhi is generally quite dismal unless you can afford to pay for a very high end hotel (there seems to be a huge jump between low, middle, to very very high end with prices to match) and this room wasn’t bad- but maybe because we were checking in fairly late at night and checking out early in the morning- our experience with staff and the hotel left us feeling rather down. A few staff members were unusually cheerful- notably the guy who accompanied the driver to pick us up, and someone in charge of finances who solved a charging problem before we even asked him to- but otherwise, our experience was tiring and we did not feel terribly welcomed. A decent deal if you are looking for a true mid-range hotel and don’t care about being picked up from the airport in time. It is also possible that our experience was unusual, so you might check other reviews to see if they were met at the airport in a timely fashion. I am sure you could do far worse in Delhi. Our issues were not with the building or facilities as much as issues with logistics/atmosphere and that is easily overlooked, especially if you’re not overtired from travel. You might consider if you are spending one day in Agra, to stay somewhere relatively inexpensive in Delhi a night, then go to a quite nice hotel in Agra, and then stay one more night in Delhi at your bargain hotel- the nicer hotel we stayed in at Agra (Hilton) was money very well spent. Note: the only guests I saw happened to be other foreign guests, which may influence the atmosphere/mood of the place. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"basic accomodation good service The hotel is decent, if you've been to Delhi you know how hard can it be to find a decent midrange hotel. The location is very chaotic and there is a is a large Sikh temple that starts chanting at about 5 am and this can wake you up (but I found it quite entertaining) so I recommend staying in Connaught Place area if you can afford it.The rooms are clean but old although some are updated, the breakfast is average compared with other hotels in India. On the positive side, this hotel offers like any other, the service of a driver, we decided to hire a driver to take us to Jaipur to avoid the crowed trains and it was the best idea. They gave us an excellent driver, very friendly and experienced in a great SUV. After we arrived to Jaipur we negotiated with the hotel and decided to keep him for the rest of our stay in India. It was fantastic, for that part along, I recommend this hotel. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Basic accomodation in frenetic Karol Bagh area With all of the poorly reviewed properties in Delhi (even the very expensive ones!), we chose Hotel Sri Nanak based on the photos on their website and the fact that they offer suites (with 4 beds) suitable for our 6 person family. In terms of the room itself (we stayed in their $120/night Presidential Suite) was spacious and of a basic 3-star level. Despite the name, it was certainly nothing fancy, furnishings were not particularly new nor did the room seem that clean. The staff was friendly and eager to help out. I'd call this hotel simply &quot;basic accomodations&quot; and not a great value all-together (even for the $65 standard rooms).The big negative for most people will be the location. Karol Bagh is India in all of its noisy, smelly, crowded, and frenetic glory. If you want to stay in the midst of a busy market area, then perhaps this is a positive, but it was nerve-wracking for us to take our kids anywhere on the street (to catch a cab etc). Also, note that there is a large Sikh temple 1 block away that starts chanting at about 5 am and this can wake you up. For most travelers (especially for your first time to India), pay the extra $ to stay in Connaught Place. "

hotel sri nanak continental ,"Excellent IF you know how bad can other places be After reading all the bad reviews here, I've decided NOT to stay in this hotel. Interestingly enough, while it was a mistake, it was worth while. Instead, I've stayed at a terrible place called Hotel Classic in Channa Market for 2 nights, before getting a room at Sri Nanak. (For those interested in the Classic story, look it up - my review is there).Had I come to Sri Nanak in the first place, I would probably have had some bad things to say about it, same as the other reviewers. However, sometimes things can be seen only in comparison. You have to experience India, before rushing to conclusions. It's DIFFERENT (India that is).The front desk staff were great. The hotel owner himself, Mr. Nanak was there - an extremely likeable and chatty fellow.The rooms are well decorated, with a flat screen plasma on the wall. You get slippers to wear while in the room. Guess what, that's a nice touch. I've spent 2 days hopping around a different hotel on towels, because I did not want to step on the disgusting floor over there. Here, the floors are clean. The slippers are a nice added touch. The bed is comfortable, albeit too short (I'm 6'2&quot; / 186cm). I've mentioned this to Mr. Nanak the following day - he said that he already had similar complaints, and was thinking about replacing the beds.Yes, there are some bugs in the bathroom. They come through the ventilation grating, where the exhaust fan is. I've mentioned this to Mr. Nanak as well, saying he should put a steel mesh grating over it, on the outside. He liked the idea. My colleague, who I've stayed in the hotel with, thinks that if we were to return there within a year, we'd see the grating in place.The upstairs restaurant is excellent, with it's own chef. A fairly large selection of Indian cuisine. Now, I don't really like Indian food, however I've enjoyed a few interesting dishes. The breakfast is sub par, but it's so cheap, I see no reason to complain.On the second night, we had dinner with Mr. Nanak, who was very entertaining, and offered some refreshing views on business and the future of India, as well as his efforts to improve the hotel.Anyhow, I'm sure a few of you will think this review is shill - I don't really care. Read my other review (about Hotel Classic) and maybe you will understand.As we were checking out, 2 British fellows just arrived. They've asked me how is the hotel. I said - is this your first time in India? They said yes. I said, in this case, I don't think you're going to like it. Everything can be known only through comparison. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Liked it so much we went back This is a friendly, clean, modern well run place. Off the beaten track in a relatively quiet corner (this is India!) of Karol Bagh, it's within walking distance of the metro and the Ajmil Kahn Road bazzar. The rooms aren't huge but they are clean and well equiped (A/C, fan, TV, fridge, hot water etc). Free Wi-fi thoughout the hotel would have been useful if we had a laptop! But there is free internet in the restaurant. The food was fine, if a little over priced compared to other places we stayed in India. You can certainly stay in cheaper places (R/- 2126 incl. taxes), but the overall experience had us revisit the two subsequent times we were passing through Delhi. The pick-up from the airport or railway station is recommended, as even if you make it to Karol Bagh, few rickshaw drivers will know where it is. Just remember to take the phone number for the hotel in case the driver is running late (we'd left it behind when we first arrived in Delhi and ended up having to stay somewhere else as there was no internet at the international airport!). That said they were great the two other times we were picked up. "

We are always so happy to stay at Sri Nanak because the staff are so responsible, always pick-up from the airport and train stations on time, and are very helpful and respectful. The restaurant is healthy and has great food! There is an excellent balcony on the roof with plants to enjoy views of the eagles circling around Delhi. The rooms are excellent, modern appliances and beautiful decor. This hotel has gone out of its' way to provide all comforts and thoughfulness towards its' guests. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Lovely Stay After reading the positive reviews about it we finally decided to go for this hotel . Sri Nanak turned out to be a amazing hotel .Its a very nicely designed hotel We got more than we expected . The staff was polite , helpful . Its is a highly maintained hotel which is worth the price you pay for .The best part was the free Wi-Fi service they provide . The modern TFT T.V. were also good .Besides that the food served at the roof top restaurant was very delicious and of high quality . I would recommend travelers not to go in for cheap options available around as you wont feel safe in other hotels . I felt totally safe staying in hotel nanak . We also went to agra by the hotel cab and our journey was perfect . They organized a perfect travel package for us . Altogether i had a perfect stay in delhi. My next holiday i will surely stay with hotel nanak only. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,Put us in a room without a window! We booked the most expensive room at the Sri Nanak and it had no windows and creaky air conditioning. We got another room which was reasonably clean but had a slightly derelict toilet. On checkout they tried to charge for the expensive room. 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"amazing stay it is no less than any of the U.K. hotels,and that to at very comparitive prices.have wireless facilties for free.in U.K. u have to pay for them.food is awesome.with nice transport facilties and free breakfast. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"HIghly rate Hotel Sri Nanak This was my first visit to India and I was coming there to first attend a professional conference for my University and then, after that to do some sightseeing. So, for the first part of my visit, I was staying in a 5 star hotel in Delhi, but I wanted to move to less expensive, safe, clean hotel for the sightseeing portion of my visit. My goal in doing this was to see and experience more of the &quot;real India&quot;.I used this web site to locate the Sri Nanak hotel. Everyone spoke glowingly about how the staff was so friendly -- and although many compained about the neighborhood, a few others said in essence &quot;what are you complaining about... it's just India.&quot; Well, that as my guidance, I booked a room. I am delighted to report that, for me, it was the perfect decision. I have traveled quite a bit internationally and my main goal was to find a place that was safe and clean -- yet would give me access to roam around the less touristed parts of Delhi and get a taste of everyday life. That's exactly what I found. Yes, the streets are noisy ... for me, that's part of the charm and interest. The people were incredibly friendly in the neighborhood. I needed to have my glasses fixed from an accident a couple of days earlier. The desk staff in the hotel gave me directions and sure enough, the opticians at Pujabi Optical not only fixed my glasses, but had me stay for tea -- and then wouldn't even accept any payment for their services. I was able to visit some intersting shops and a small streetside Hindu shrine -- and, in each location, I experienced great hospitality. The hotel itself is clean, and the rooms certainly provide all the amenities I needed. Yes, the beds are on the hard side, but I like them that way, so for me that was not a problem. The free wireless in the rooms was much appreciated, and the tv, phone, and plumbing all worked fine. One more thing about the complimentary airport service. I had arranged to stay at the Sri Nanak for one day, then travel via airline to another part of India for a few days and then return to Delhi for another day before returning to the US. So, I had arranged for the Sri Nanak to have someone pick me up at the airport. Through a mistake in their scheduling procedure, the cab driver was told that I would arrive at 5:00 pm (when that was actually the time that I was leaving another city in India). When I arrived at 9 pm that night, the driver was still at the airport waiting for me. I was blown away by that level of conscientiousness. Needless to say, I was happy to give the driver a large tip.My goals and desires may not match those of other travelers, but for me the hotel Sri Nanak was the perfect location. If I am ever back in Delhi (which I hope to be), I definitely plan to make the Sri Nanak my home base. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,Dirty loud hotel - completely overrated This hotel left everything to be desired. The noise inside and out made it impossible to sleep - as did the hair from the previous guest left on the sheets. The staff was unfriendly and not helpful. I would strongly advise against staying in this hotel. 
hotel sri nanak continental ,moved after 1 night very isolated - long walk to train station. taxi/rickshaws tell you they know where it is but don't. filthy street even by delhis standards. grim breakfast. redeeming feature - flashy showers - if they worked properly! 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Overpromised and greatly underdelivered Overpromised and greatly underdelivered My husband and I have stayed at many hotels worldwide and this is most definitely the WORST hotel that we have come across, despite the fact that we only stayed for 3 nights. We had read several positive reviews before booking our stay at Sri Nanak but on arrival we were thoroughly disappointed. My husband and I arrived at 10pm from Bangalore. On arrival we were greeted by a young man at reception with &quot;Oh...so you are Mr Quayum?&quot;. I may have an Indian surname with an English accent but this hardly conveys confidence for a hotel meant for international tourists. Our stay as listed: 1. The bed covers were dirty, complimentary with long black hairs and small dead flies in the folds. We had to request for 'clean' sheets. 2. The air conditioning (a large machine) was noisy and positioned directly by the bed at arm's length. 3. The hotel's website states 'running hot and cold water' - hot water was only available on running the hot tap for over 20 minutes, when we informed reception that there was no hot water, we were told to keep running it until it became hot! 4. The bathroom fan exploded (yes...sparks and smoke and then black out!) I called reception, somebody came up and told me that they would have an electrician see to it the next day - this did not happen...surprisingly. 5. At 4am we were woken up by someone banging on our door (the doors were flimsy and the staff kept trying to open the door from the outside at other times)! There were no door signs to state 'Do not disturb' or 'Please clean my room'. 6. These rooms are not sound proofed - we could hear guests chatting loudly and their children running up and down the corridor outside our room at 6am. 7. The wardrobe door was broken, dirty and had a strong odour so we decided against keeping anything in there. 8. There was a safe in the wardrobe however it was not bolted down or attached to anything - so anyone could walk off with it! All in all a miserable stay that we had to make do with as there was no time to search for other hotels during our 3 night stay in Delhi. Think very carefully before staying here...you have been warned! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"barely expensive It is not a bad hotel if you compare it to other Karol Bagh hotels, but unfortunatelly it costs 10 times what another similar kind of hotel will cost you in new Delhi. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Great Hotel Was very apprehensive about booking a hotel in Karol Bagh as I was travelling with a girly party (my 23 month daughter, mum, mother in law and sister.) However this hotel was fab - we booked the presidential suite which was ideal for a family as we had two separate rooms within one room and allowed privacy and peace for my daughter to sleep.The hotel location is fantastic with the Gurudwara, McDonalds and Pizza Hut, ATM and the great shops all in walking distance.The hotel restaurant is OK, food is nice and room service is handy too but you can order takeaway to your room which is an added bonus.The water is a bit temperamental but you only have to leave it running for 5mins and it’s hot - not a problem.The hotel is very clean and well kept.Staff are good and manager very nice.If staying in Karol Bagh - go here "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Sri Nanak -great if you can get a cab to find it !! Having read various reviews of Sri Nanak, we-a party of 4-booked directly for 5 nights, and requested the presidential suite.We were generally pleased with the room-more likely to impress a president from a small nation than &quot; ol' W&quot; of the US Survey- but there were various things that could have been cleaner-the bath took for ever to run away, but as a mid range hotel it served its purpose well. The room was large and has a fridge and table and chairs as well as a sofa and a chaise long......A real bonus is the roof top restaurant-serving breakfast lunch and evening meals. It's good value and the food is generally very tasty. Nice to sit in at night and sup a beer or two-providing they don't run out !One other point to bear in mind is that Sri Nanak is a way out from the centre of Delhi-Karol Bagh is a area of town that not a lot of cab drivers from Connaught Place seem to know very well- one night whilst coming back the driver got lost and was asking a local for the hotel -showing him a card with the address on: The man disclaimed any knowledge of the hotel or road: At that point we realised that we were actually no more than a hundred yards from it and actually in the right street !!All in all a good bet if your not too fussy. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,Expensive for what you get I booked this hotel based on online reviews. I knew that it was basic and several reviews indicated good service. On arrival it was clear that the rooms were very basic but clean. Staff were pleasant. Internet use was good and free. Rooftop restaurant was extremely average. The location was on a very nosiy busy street in a very run down area of Delhi. Most guests are locals. My airport pickup was OK and free but airport drop off has to be paid for. The cost for a basic room was US$40 and a suite (a glorified basic room) was US$81. The term &quot;suite&quot; should be interpreted with caution. All in all basic accomodation with no frills should really be cheaper. 
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Nice by India standard Nice enough place. Nothing great on the outside, but rooms were more western then most. I would reccomend it over many other hotels. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Think twice before staying here We decided to stay at the Sri Nanak last month after reading all the positive reviews, however we were quite disappointed.The rooms themselves were ok, reasonably clean, however the bathroom was well below standard and the door was rotten. No hot water in the afternoons either.The front desk appeared helpful, but on a number of occasions tried to over charge us for taxis, cars etc. They also misled us regarding the excursions to places like Agra.I can see how some visitors have found the staff to be overly helpful, but a more seasoned traveller will be more savvy and realise when they're trying to take you for a ride!The most negative thing was that when we left the hotel and arrived in Mumbai we realised that some clothing had been stolen from our suitcase. So if you stay at the Sri Nanak make sure you always leave your suitcases locked even if there's nothing valuable inside!We travelled around India for some time and the Sri Nanak is far below the 3* stars it claims in comparison to the other hotels we stayed at.Finally, if you do choose to stay here (which I wouldn't do again), then book directly with the hotel as the rate is MUCH lower than offered by third-party booking websites. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Give it a miss We planned to stay at this hotel for three nights, however checked out after the first night. The hotel was very noisy, the bed sheets reeked of some petroleum products, the phone did not work, the shower did not have a curtain and the flow projected straight over the toilet and the roof top breakfast area had filthy tablecloths. When we said we were not staying, they advised us that we had to pay for 3 nights as we had not given 24 hours notice of cancellation of our other 2 nights. We replied that this was not possible as we did not know that the hotel would be so bad. We were extremely lucky in that as we were discussing this a colleague of my husbands happended to walk into reception, a total coincidence as we did not even know they were in Delhi, and they had just checked out for the same reasons, which gave credibility to our complaints. We left paying for the night we stayed. I do not recommend this hotel. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Avoid This Hotel . Its over-rated Having read the good reviews on tripadvisor and some other websites i decided to book this hotel. I was dissapointed when i got there. First of all they gave us a room that was not in good condition at all and faced the main road which was noisy. When i complained they then gave us an alternative. If i had not complained they would have left us there . The rooms are not in good condition, the duvets and blankets are not clean. The hotel had promised us a welcoming fruit basket which we did not receive. The location of the hotel is not good. The roads are dirty , busy , noisy and polluted. Having travelled around in delhi, there are other nicer and claner places to stay. On one day our room was not cleaned, we were told that as we had taken the key they did not clean it even though all hotels have master keys. The dining area is located on the rooftop which was nice in the mornings. When we booked taxis from the hotel, we later discovered that the hotel was charging a commision for the service. Also , the hotel gave us a poor exchange rate commision when we exchanged currencies. Ignore the good reviews you see for this hotel, as non of them are true. I am suspicious as to the source of these. Avoid at any cost. You are better paying a bit more and getting something alot better. I will not be staying here again and nor will i recommend this to anyone. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Not for everyone The hotel did send a driver to pick us up from Delhi airport which was a god send and all the staff were very polite and helpful. I am surprised that no-one seems to have mentioned how hard the beds were though. I asked for extra blankets to put under me as it was like sleeping on a rock! I think it might be a suitable hotel for backpackers or seasoned travellers but not for first time visitors to India as Delhi is a bit of a shock in itself. The hotel is not in a great area and we were woken up the first morning at 5am by a parade going by that we actually thought was a riot! and the second morning at 4.30 by someone with REALLY LOUD speakers in the middle of the road. Very bizarre. The hotel is also quite noisy - but so is India! Overall we had a great holiday but even though the staff and restaurant were very good I would recommend spending a bit more and staying in a good hotel in Delhi in a central area. Of all the areas we toured, Delhi is the probably the biggest shock, and a good hotel is a must. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"A good hotel when travelling with children ..esp the presidential suite We stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and overall I would say it was good place to stay.We were picked up from the airport which we were grateful for. We were travelling with children and stayed in the Maharaja suite which was quite good. We had a problem with the TV , they fixed it promptly. The staff were polite and happy and the manager Sandeep was friendly and takes a lot pf pride in his hotel.The taxi to the station in the early morning was a nightmare and so was the pick up the following week-end. I don't rate their taxi service. There was a mix up with our rooms the following week-end , we had pre booked and confirmed for the following week-end but we were offered an &quot;alternative &quot; maharaja suite which did not have the bunk beds for the kids. After a bit of protest and disatisfaction we were offered the presidential suite (at the same price) - which is very good. It can sleep up to 6. I would say not all the staff are conscientious as the manager.We had breakfast in our room and also ate once upstairs in the roof top hotel. The food is reasonable and I would eat again.The back of the hotel is not noisy.Karol Bagh is not one of the best area but there is a metro station nearby and a gurud wara , from where we heard lovely melodic hyms once.The rooms are what you see on their web sites. I would suggest you look at the room first before accepting it. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"fantastic management average 3 start hotel situated in a busy commerical area. not your above average hotel (this will cost you an arm and leg in Delhi) but staff and management go out of their way to make your stay stress free and relaxing as possible!my daughter got sick one nite and i foned reception at 2 am...they got a taxi for me and manager himself came with us to hospital...a fantastic gesture i thought!!!!internet, massage chair, newspapers, airport pick up and drop off, one whole day sighseeeing tour, half day shopping tour and fruit bowel were all given free of charge together with 5 key ring holders!For the price definitely woth the value! "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Think carefully before going here This hotel was not what I expected from the reviews. Our family of four had two rooms booked for the nights of 8, 9, 10 January. We were met at the airport and transported by two cars (we had been promised one large car). Karol Bagh is not the best area to stay in but the hotel staff were courteous. However, the rooms did not live up to expectation. Our girls room had the most terrible smell in the room and on all the bed linen, and they had to lay some of their clothes on the pillow so as not to breathe in the fumes. We did ask for a change, but the alternative was no better. Our room had no fridge, the jug didn't work and the shower water just fell all over the floor of the bathroom. No beds had been swept under for some time! Decided there and then to telephone somewhere else, except the phone didn't work, not then nor in the morning. Neither did it in the girls' room nor the room of some friends we ran into unexpectedly in reception the following morning who were also checking out because of the smell in their room. They had also read the trip advisor reviews and were pretty disillusioned.. My husband also didn't sleep because of the noise. We moved to the Jukaso Inn downtown near Connaught Place which was around the same price and much more satisfactory. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Very good hotel We thought this was a lovely small well run hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi. The staff were fantastic and incredibly helpful. We chose the presidential suite which is ideal for a family as it can easily sleep up to 5 - 6 people with 2 bathrooms. The hotel had some nice touches including free internet access, a daily paper pushed under the door and a fresh bowl of fruit served every day. The restaurant offered a good range of dishes, it got a bit chilly in the evening in January (it's on the roof) so we opted to have meals served in our room. The Karol Bagh area is busy in the day with plenty of shops but it does get quiet enough in the evening and we had no problems sleeping. We tended to use the taxi service from the hotel which was great and reasonably priced - the drivers really took care of us and cut out the hassle. It took about 15 minutes to get to Connaught Circus. All in all a great stay. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"ok I stayed in this hotel in January. It was clean, inexpensive and the staff were generally helpful. The wireless internet was very useful and there were no problems with the hot water once we got used to the taps. However, this hotel is definitely not a luxury option and the location in Karol Bagh is not great. I agree with the comment that this hotel is a bit like a cheap 1970s US motel, or one of the two-star hotels you find in the Pigalle area of Paris. If I stayed in Delhi again, I would probably stay in a five star hotel, as there is a dearth of high quality mid-range options in that city. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Average The hotel was average, nothing special at all. The area is not the best at night. Our particular room had no windows and the mattress was very thin! The staff at the front desk did really care about anything and were always on the phone. I would try and find something closer. Dont trust the photo's. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"All over nice The executive room was clean and quite modern, with a nice bathroom with shower. All in all a nice tourist class hotel giving you great value for your money.The hotel is placed quite sentral in New Dehli, a short ride from the railwaystation. Try to avoid eating in the resturant, as it was nothing special. It looked old, dirty and beeing at the top floor of the hotel you would expect a view,well there is not.The sourrundings of the hotel is not much at night, with the only lights coming from ATMs and jevellers shops. If you need a place just for the night i would recomend Sri Nanak continental. The staff was friendly and serviceminded during the two days stay 20-22 of desember. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Clean book direct Clean in general. The hot water seemed to be by request and then you needed to wait 30 minutes. This seemed to be the case in some places across India in mid-range hotels, but we thought they could do a bit more. The breakfast is very basic and not very tasty. We didn't like the area either as you aren't near to anything really. We had to request cleaner towels and toilet paper. It seems hard to find a decent hotel in Delhi. This wasn't bad, but book directly as we booked through expedia and paid over the odds. Staff were friendly enough. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Surprisingly good Obviously, the Sri Nanak is not the Hyatt or the Sheraton. However, once you get over your initial doubts, for instance, about the area the hotel is located in, then it's not a bad hotel at all. In fact, as it turns out, Karol Bagh, the area where the hotel is located offers some of the busiest and most authentic street markets of Delhi. It is a GREAT place for doing shopping, dining, etc. once you get used to the huge amounts of people on the street, the cars, the noise, etc. The hotel itself is simple, but clean, and the staff is quite friendly. They also have on the roof of the hotel a restaurant, which offers a rather unattractive breakfast for westeners, but quite delicious Indian cuisine. Also, Karol Bagh is a very lively area, so there is a fair amount of noise during the day, but at night it quietens down. Then the only thing noticable is the barking of the street dogs...I would definitely go there again, although I can see that the Sri Nanak is not for everyone. A big plus should also be mentioned: they offer free WiFi in all rooms! Very, very handy when you are in India. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"not bad for a first time visitor to delhi we found the surrounding location pretty scary.it looked even more run down and destitute than i imagined, its right on the edge of the biggest market in asia and the hussle and bustle was a bit intimidating on the first day.after a day or so we got into it and thought it was pretty cool.if your looking for budget prices then stay away i think we paid over the odds compared with other places we stayed.the hotel itself was clean and tidy, the staff helpful and the food was ok. would i stay again - yes i think i would. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Clean safe and excellent value for money Being a lone female arriving in Delhi at 4am I was very pleased to take advantage of the free hotel transfer. I think I might have been a little stressed otherwise given the things you see at the airport.The staff were excellant and went out of their way to help. The hotel was very clean. The bathroom was fine and certainly better than a lot of places in Delhi at this price, that's for sure. There was a complimentary bottle of water and basket of fruit in my room. The beds were reasonably comfortable but not sprung. I found it a little noisy at times. For instance there was a family on my floor who insisted on having a conversation at 2am in the corridor, and they weren't exactly using hushed tones. One thing I would suggest is that they introduce &quot;Do not disturb&quot; signs that can be posted outside the door so the staff don't keep disturbing you when all you want to do is sleep off your travelling and jet lag.I didn't actually venture out of the hotel as the area doesn't look that enticing but I didn't think is was unsafe either. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Not for the faint of heart. Adventurers ony. If you are looking at this hotel and are used to the good stuff (Sofitels, Hiltons, etc.) you SHOULD STOP NOW. The whole Delhi experience is a jarring one for westerners, and frankly, while going to a hotel like this is safe, it will make the experience that much more trying. If you are looking at it because no other rooms are available in the entire city (which is what happened to me) go ahead and cancel your trip to Delhi, or head on over to Mumbai, which is a city that actually has a good airport, roads, and enough good hotels to hold everyone.I should note though that the staff was VERY friendly. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Unbeatable value for the budget; friendly I am an American, and I've stayed at this hotel twice in the past 30 days, each time for a few nights. Think 1970's Best Western or Days Inn goes masala, and you'll get a sense of decor and premesis condition. I came back to the hotel because the staff really is friendly and gives 5 star worth of helpful service. I did not eat there, so I can't comment on that. Yes the neighborhood is noisy from 7:30 am 'til 9:30pm. But I slept like a rock. Yes the mattress was thin, but that's the style here. Like I said, I slept like a rock. I read the review by someone who was not expecting an Indian-style bathroom (he's in India - what did he expect?). There's a toilet, toilet paper, shower head, but no tub. It was no problem for me; just don't put your toiletries-bag on the floor while you shower. The place is cleanish: some of the hardware is old, but nothing is dusty or moldy, just worn. That goes for the sheets and towels too, but I had no problem with using them. If you have your laundry done, be sure to specifically identify what you don't want ironed! The default is to iron it, what ever the material. A couple of polyester shirts came out shiny from too hot an iron. The second time, I'd learned my lesson, pointed out what not to iron, and there were no problems. When I come back to Delhi, I will defintely stay here because the folks are friendly and the value is unbeatable! One piece of advice, consider either retaining whatever driver you pick up from in front of the hotel or learn how to walk to the hotel from the gurdwara, because taxi drivers can't find this place. I suspect many taxi-walas can't read, so the map on the back of the hotel's business card is useless to drivers, who will drive two blocks, stop, ask for directions, advance two more blocks, repeat. The gurdwara, however, is easy to find. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"I would stay there again! We chose this hotel based on the positive reviews, which I pretty much agree with. The place is very clean, not luxury level, but for the price, it's a bargain. The restaurant and staff are outstanding, and the free internet is a bonus. The only down side is that the neighborhood is nothing special. It's not bad, or unsafe, just nothing to interest a tourist. Don't expect a four star resort, just expect a nice clean room and a hard working staff who aims to please. We didn't use the hotel's travel arrangements, but others who did seemed pleased. The hotel did provide free pickup at the airport, which was also a good feature. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Good hotel good value... I got the &quot;presidential suite&quot; for about $100USD during late Nov 2006. Very large room, with 1.5 baths. Other rooms are probably half this cost. Great for our family of four, and it could easily sleep six with its one king, one full and two twin bunkbeds. It was clean, and service was very good. Ordered room service and food was good as well. Free internet. I would easily recommend staying here. Located near Connaught Place. About 40 mins to the airport in Delhi traffic, but it took us exactly 20 minutes at 4:30AM since there was no traffic that early. "
hotel sri nanak continental ,"Good overall hotel The hotel is located in Karol Bagh which is a very busy and tight area in the centre of Delhi. Although quite noisy, it does quieten down during the night. Karol Bagh is good for shopping and it is easy to grab an Auto (3 wheeled taxi) to Connaught Place.As promised, I was provided with complimentary pickup from the airport which is 30-45 mins away from the hotel. The hotel looks quite small from the outside and reception is also small. The rooms however are fairly spacious and tastefully decorated, spread over 3 floors. The most important thing is that the rooms are all clean and air conditioned. Free internet access is also provided in the hotel's basement.The hotel staff, including its drivers, are all very polite and friendly. Sightseeing tours are available in comfortable air conditioned vehicles.I was delighted with the quality of the food at the hotel's rooftop restaurant. The menu contained an assortment of dishes at very resonable prices, all cooked traditionally. I highly recommend the &quot;Afghani Chicken&quot;!Overall I was happy with my 5 nights stay at the hotel. If you're looking for a good 3 star hotel at a reasonable rate, located in the centre of Delhi, then this hotel is definitely worth considering. "

hotel sunrise ,Good location We stayed at this hotel for a few nights in Nov 09. The room was very small the airconditioner was much too noisy we had to turn it off. The staff were OK as long as you kept tipping them. They only clean room if asked to. Breakfast was terriable. There is no resturant but the do have room service agian the food was awful. . 
hotel sunrise ,Foul Smell in the Room Why do they have to use the detergent which give a foul smell in therooms. I change my room 5 times but the rooms were dark and smelly.But had to manage the night because it was 1`o’ clock at night and Ishifted to a nearly hotel which was much better. 
hotel sunrise ,Never Never This Hotel A bunch of touts who are only interested to make extra money. We werecharged heavily for going to Taj Mahal by taxi as they because afterour life at night when we came to the hotel. We could have done thesame thing from another travel agent at one third of the price. 
hotel sunrise ,"FIRST CLASS HOTEL I recentley stayed at the Hotel Sunrise. The hotel and rooms there are faultless. Very comfortable, unbelievably clean and beautifully furnished. The service there is exellant and you will not be dissapointed by the hospitality given by all the staff. The restaurant serve beautiful food and is very good value. This hotel is in a perfect location and is ideal for anyone visiting Delhi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. "
hotel sunrise ,"DONT GO HERE I read the reviews, and I understand how somle people may have been fooled by the owners smile. But dont let the friendliness fool you, this hotel is a complete scam unless you already know India and are Indian yourself. The hotel owner lied to us several times when we asked him travel questions, including telling us that the only way to travel was by train or car, and that we would have to wait 8-10 days for a train ticket (a complete lie, when we finally found the REAL international tourist office at the New Delhi rail, we got a ticket for the next day at HALF the price he told us). Every time we asked the staff a simple travel question, such as where the regional trains left from; they refered us to the owner, who would proceed to lie. He offered us a car too; as a ridiculous price, and tried showing us pictures of happy customers. While he searched through, instead sketchy pictures of women posing for him in bedrooms came up which he quickly hid. Eventually he realized we werent game for his information. The moment we solidly said no to his travel car, was the moment the smiles stopped from him. Some of the staff of his is friendly, but this guy is a pure scam artist. DONT GIVE HIM BUSINESS. Please, for the sake of those who lost money; got ripped off; got stuck in broken down cars miles away, DONT GO HERE.O ya, and it does have WIFI, but it doesnt reach your room. Also the area is scam central, as number one business around isnt the market, its scamming travel agencies running the same bit he is. And on one last note, the interior of the hotel is a weak escape from delhi polluted air as the staff constantly cleans the floor with toxic smelling cleaning products that were long ago banned from the west. "
hotel sunrise ,"Very clean friendly family type hotel in the REAL India I stayed at Sunrise for 17 days last month - over the Diwali period and can recommend it. I am about to return there in December1- It is a newly and completely restored small hotel, new bathrooms, furniture and a nice new mattress etc and kept very clean.2- While some of the staff are not highly trained professionals this adds to the charm - it is like a family run hotel and any minor flaws are fixed up swiftly and cheerfully. 3- The front desk staff are some of the friendliest and nicest people i have met in India. Ms Leena is a gem with the biggest welcoming smile in Delhi.4- I grew to love Karol Bagh. It is a REAL Indian bazarr with great character and not much touristy stuff however It can be a little confronting at first but stick with it because all the shops you could ever need and great markets and stalls, hundreds of them are just a walk away. Yes there are several small quiet parks in Karol Bagh and an amazing wood carving studio and gallery just next door but one to the hotel.5- And the efficient and clean KAROL BAGH Metro Station is just a few minutes away. three stops to Connaught Place - called Rajiv Chowk Station. You dont want to be relying on driving everywhere in Delhi. No way! The crowds dont start till noon so get going early if you want to miss them in Karol Bagh's wonderful narrow streets..6- Sure the breakfast is basic..but it breaks your fast and its free, I usually added a great fresh cut fruit salad for a modest sum and was very happy. If you want a REALLY good coffee in Delhi avoid the trendy coffee palaces at Connaught Place and go to Religare - Arts_i Gallery Its on the corner Connaught Circus and Kasturba Ghandi Marg. 1st floor. best coffee and good food with great art.7- Sunrise is a new hotel so to find it ask to be taken to the Regal Continental Hotel. The entrance is in a clean lane and Sunrise is RIGHT NEXT DOOR set back from the lane so it can be hard to see. Alternatively when driving down Saraswati Marg the CLARK HOTEL sign is easy to spot - its a good hotel too! - The Regal and Sunrise are in the same unnamed lane on the other side of Saraswati Marg as the CLARK. Remember those tips and Sunrise is easy for you and your driver to find. Maybe I will see you there in December. An Oz traveller. "
hotel sunrise ,"This hotel is scamming I had booked two days and went there to cancel the first day of my booking and add two additional days. So I paid, but after that they said &quot;we don't have any empty rooms but we will do our best&quot;. What that was supposed to mean I had to find out later...The first day of my stay they recognized me on the street, asking me &quot;what are you doing here? we didn't expect you&quot;. Refering to our agreement and payment, they just said &quot;In business, trust doesn't matter. But of course we have a room for you today, but you'd need to pay for that&quot; (pay again, what the heck?!). In the middle of the dispute they asked for my receipt, saying &quot;we need that&quot;. Thinking they just needed it temporary to give me a refund or make a copy or something, I handed it to them. But they wouldn't return it to me! And that was it, still standing on the street, and for them, the story was over.To sum it all up: I paid them for THREE days, I stayed there ZERO days and left with NO receipts or bills to prove anything or file case against them!

hotel sunrise ,"Good location good price and great stay We have read some good and bad comments on Trip Advisor about Hotel Sunrise. We booked this hotel for 1 day to check there services and thought if they provide us good service then we can extend our stay. They pick-up us from airport early morning because our flight Finn Air was arrive at Delhi airport very early morning. We had check-in. They provide us very good room with window with Balcony. So we decide to stay other 4 days. Hotel front Manager Ms. Leena was very friendly and always smile and ask us Madam are you satisfied with our services. and we smile too and reply he Lenna we are very happy.

hotel sunrise ,"OK but ... My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in October 2009. The room was fine although we had to ask for a top sheet on the bed. The a/c worked ok but was somewhat noisy with a rapping sound. The breakfast was very good although the coffee seemed to be instant Nescafe. The neighborhood, however, is a drawback. The streets are terribly crowded, noisy, and dirty, and there are touts every step of the way. The best aspect of this hotel is the remarkably low price -- around $30 per night. "
hotel sunrise ,"Best hotel in budget price Hotel Sunrise is the best hotel in budget price. Hotel location is good for shopping. Me and my wife stayed in this hotel we feel very comfortable. Food was good, Hotel staff was kind and friendly and help us about shopping near by hotel and they help us for bargaining in the price because we are from Chennai. This is good for new traveler in Delhi. We will send our friends to this hotel.We will recommend this hotel to all the traveler's who come to Delhi first time. Thank you very much all the staff for taking care of us.Thanks and regards,Lakhey "
hotel sunrise ,"worst hotel i have ever seen heading: the reality of this hotel.during my stay in india, i booked this hotel.hotel owner did not seem to run a hotel business, he was rather intersted in booking my agra-jaipur trip. i was given a non ventilated shabby room and on complainin he promised to upgrade me only if i book trip with him.when i refused for the trip, a black tall man with red eyes took me to his travel agency on the corner of the road. i was so scared.that owner also started following me. upon reaching there, they pressurised and as i was a sole travelller in this alien place i had no option but to accept the tour and pay them.the next morning, a small little car in bad condition arrived.i reluctantly sat in it as i was told that no other option is available.as expected, the car broke halfway. JESUS!!! i immediately left that place and had to walk around 5 miles to get another taxi.i rushed back to delhi and checked out of this hotel.they didnot refund any of my money.I felt cheated and i felt as if they are not hoteliers, they are a bunch of touts.!!!

hotel sunrise ,"Home away from home Hotel Sunrise is the hotel clean and comfortable. It's create as a Home away from home. They are take care of the matteress, bedsheet, curtains, wall colours, linen and the cleanliness of the whole hotel. I also took few pictures of Hotel by phone. They don't provide you just a service, but they give you an experience. all staff are very Friendly. The one place where you can be sure that your trip will always be a pleasure. You will get everything near by Hotel. so, come and enjoy your holidays. "
hotel sunrise ,Dreadful Experince at Sunrise Its a worst ever Hotel I have stayed with. Staff with no professionalism &amp; every time taxi drivers are sitting at reception in dirty clothes looking for there customers. I was badly scared to check-in into this Hotel but had no option in the mid night. whole night staff shuts &amp; screams. Rats &amp; lizards are just like room partners staying over there in all rooms When I was not comfortable with the atmosphere I requested to refund my money I paid for but they refused to return my money &amp; misbehaved with me &amp; said that I can leave from the Hotel. The owner himself doesn't know the meaning of courtesy.I do prefer t sleep on streets rather than staying Over sunrise where Sun can never rise 
hotel sunrise ,"Hotel Sunrise and Its owner Mr. Singh were great. I am a NRI (non-resident Indian) and live in the US. I was in Delhi with my (American) extended family members as a tourist. I stayed in Hotel Sunrise for 4 nights in late September 2009. We rented 3 rooms. Our rooms were spacious and clean. House keeping was excellent. Hotel mangement was very friendly and helpful and almost every one in the hotel staff spoke English. The hotel owner, Mr. Singh, arranged taxi (with a guide) for us to go to Taj Mahal and surroundings and also for sightseeing in Delhi. He also had the taxi take us to the airport at 4.30AM to catch an early flight. Mr. Singh did a fantastic job and all with a joke and a broad smile.Both the hotel rates and the taxi charges were extremely reasonable for Delhi. I would recommend this hotel without any reservation to anybody planning a trip to Delhi and I will be a repeat customer here next time I visit Delhi.Mr. Singh, Thank you and take care.Raj Natarajan, Texas, USA "
hotel sunrise ,"Good clean and safe hotel for family Hotel Sunrise is a good clean and safe hotel for family. Friendly and good staff and always ready for help. We have booked Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Haridwar trip with this Hotel in a package and we realy enjoyed our trip. Driver was very good, he showed us all most all the sight seeing places, some times problem but this is normal when we travel in different city. But we all are very satisfied and happy with Hotel Sunrise services. Thank you so much Hotel Sunrise Staff.OM "
hotel sunrise ,"Ok Hotel. Don't do the tour The hotel was ok for the price. However, the tour guide service associated with the hotel was pretty bad. The driver in Delhi was ok. But then when we traveled to Agra from Delhi, the driver was horrible. He yelled at us and made the trip horrible. When we got to Agra, we called the tour guide head office and asked to get another driver. The new driver couldn't make it until the next day, so we had to pay for a new tour in Agra. When we ask the head tour guy for money back he said that he would plan something special for us in Jaipur. Did anything happen? No. If I had to do it over again, I would have found a different tour group. Otherwise the hotel is ok for the price. "
hotel sunrise ,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE FROM EUROPE OR THE WEST Very disappointing hotel and people running the place. This is definitely not a 3 star hotel. We made reservations online. When we got there they didn't even have our reservations. The room they gave us didn't have any windows and the bathroom was below standard - much different from the description given online. After my wife and I settled in bed, we got a call in the middle of the night and the receptionist said that we had to change the room since the room was already reserved for someone else. This was very inconvenient. The last night we stayed there, we were woken up in the middle of the night by the people from the reception and their friends making a lot of noise and talking very loud down the hallway. On check out, we left with a bad feeling. We found out later that the receptionist charged us 5 times the normal taxi fare to the train station. In addition, we were ripped off when the director of the hotel purchased train tickets for us. He lied about the ticket price. Unfortunately, because of him we ended up paying almost 70% more for the tickets than they were worth. Stay away from this place. They run it like an indian mafia. Very disappointing and very unprofessional. "
hotel sunrise ,"Great Stay at Hotel Sunrise We found this hotel on the internet, it was new so we thought we would try it. The hotel was well worth the money, the rooms are well presented, extremely CLEAN and well fitted out with TV, bar fridge, AC and attached bathrooms. The staff were so friendly and accomodating, in our first room the internet signal was a little low so they actually moved us to a room with better signal straight away! We couldn't of asked for anymore, we will be staying here again when we return to Delhi! Thanks Hotel Sunrise! "
hotel sunrise ,"comment on the excellent service of hotel sunrise I Mrs. Naidoo traveled with my Sister to New Delhi booked the hotel sunrise from South Africa. As per our booking, everything went as planned. we were picked up from the airport driven start to the hotel, on arrival it was the most unexpected welcoming, where we was offered drinks and we were garland then we were escorted to our suit. Our room was very beautiful we felt at home room service was excellent. The food was divine. View was good. The most exciting part of our trip was that the management helped us arrange or tour in and around Delhi, our car was booked itinerary was set and were ready for our tour. “Oh my god it was a tour out of this world!” at the end of it all we were driven back to the airport. To conclude I would recommend this hotel to each and every traveler I know, who is looking for an unforgettable holiday, adventurous tour &amp; a luxurious stay…P.S... Many thanks to management and all staff of the hotel sunrise You’re sincerelyMRS. Naidoo "
hotel sunrise ,"Hotel people will beat you up careful! I came for business to Delhi. However I am a frequent traveller and saw a good review of this &quot;so called new hotel&quot;. So decided to catch up this hotel. But oh God it should not be termed as a hotel. It had RATS in the room. The bed sheets were torn. The Aircondition was not working and there was no water when I went to take a shower. The bathroom had so much of foul smell that I had to pack up my bag and just leave. When I wanted to leave they charged me extra money which was not agreed at the time of check in. They forced me to pay. It was a nightmare and I thought the musclemen will come and beat me up, if I dont pay I was horrified. "
hotel sunrise ,"undisovered gem of a place in Delhi As I write this, I am still a guest at this Hotel. We wanted to book this hotel from Bangalore itself but did not have suffecient info to do that. We booked at another popular hotel and arrived at Delhi. One night at the Popular &quot; south indian &quot; hotel , and we beat a hasty retreat. We had the address of Hotel Sunrise but NOT thier telephone number [--]. Hence the next day we made it a point to SEARCH for the hotel and finally found it ( Next to Regent Hotel, Opp Clark Hotel Road, SaraswathyMarg, Karol Bagh, New Delhi ).The Hotel is brand new and it shows. Rooms are small but neat and clean. The staff is very courteous and though the restaurant is not yet open, the Room service more than adequately makes up for it. The location is excellent and the room service is good.Since we are going to be staying in delhi for six days, it suits our budjet and serves our purpose. I would recommed this to all budjet travellers who are looking for a cozy nook in the centre of the city. "
hotel sunrise ,"AVOID THIS HOTEL I booked 2 nights at this hotel through expedia, the price included pick up from the airport which was important to me as a single female traveller. i received an e-mail from the hotel before I left for India confirming pick up however upon arrival at the airport there was no-one waiting for me. I contacted the hotel by telephone and was told to get a pre-paid taxi and they would pay for it. I did this however taxi driver was unable to find the hotel. It was 2 o'clock in the morning by this time and the area was deserted. We eventually found a travel agent who amazingly was still open. The agent did not know where the hotel was but let me use his phone to contact the hotel. I rang and asked if they could give the taxi driver directions however was informed that the hotel was full and they did not have a room for me. I explained I had booked and paid for my room and that I had spoken with someone earlier and explained the situation about the taxi and that I was a single female traveller. The person just kept saying they were full and then put the phone down on me. The taxi driver was going mad and said he wanted paying. I had no ruppees as I had expected the hotel to pay. The travel agent came to my rescue and I am not sure what I would have done without him. `he paid the taxi driver who just got my case out of the car and left me. The agent then contacted the hotel and found out where it was and went to the hotel and sorted a room for me. According to the agent it is common in India for hotels to say they have no rooms to people who have booked as a scam to get more money!!!. I eventually got to the hotel where they showed me 2 rooms to choose from (a plus side is that the room was big). I had to argue with them the next day to get the money back for the taxi. The whole experience was distressing, I do not know what would have happened to me if it were not for the kindness of the agent Rauf (PS his company is Le Nagooes Tour and Travel Company, Karol Bagh, email [--]) I think any hotel that would leave anyone in the position I was in should be avoided. "
hotel sunrise ,"New hotel offering excellent value and service in bustling Karol Bagh. Hotel Sunrise opened four months ago and, as such, seems to be an undiscovered budget gem in the heart of bustling Karol Bagh. I give 4 stars to service only because some local staff are still learning subtle aspects of room service; however, lobby management is very professional and was quite receptive to suggestions I offered concerning room service. In addition to running a spotlessly clean hotel, the hotel owners offer a wide range of other services in Delhi and around the country; these include custom travel packages to suit the wishes and desires of most customers. My wife and I come yearly to India and we will undoubtedly avail ourselves of the services offered at Hotel Sunrise! (Conference center and a roof-top restaurant are under construction as we speak.)

hotel sunstar grand ,"damp room loud and not so clean We found Delhi to be a very filthy, polluted and loud city and really would have enjoyed an oasis from the chaos but this was not it. like most of india this hotel was dirty the room looked like it needed a good cleaning. we had a large fan in our bathroom that was very loud with scary exposed wiring and the entire room had a moisture problem. the bedding felt damp. the room service menu was crusted with food. the room was very loud with staff banging things outside the door at all hours of the night. again the typical male staff, no female employees. the breakfast room was a dark dreary place and again felt very dirty. my first suggestion would be to skip delhi as it is a horrible city (we were also warned but did not listen) but if you must go book a 5 star. you are gonna need it. we had lunch at the imperial hotel and it was very nice. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Okay though a nice respite from hectic Delhi We stayed here as part of an Intrepid Tour (North India Highlights). The hotel was a good area with lots of shops and was very close to the Metro. Both times (at the beginning of the trip and at the end) we were placed in rooms that faced the street. While we had windows, the street noise was pretty bad (though it was generally quiet from about midnight to 6 am or so). The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large, and there was plenty of hot water. The staff was nice, though sometimes pushy. We did eat at the restaurant once (on the rooftop) and the food was actually pretty good. "

However mini bar, dont drink the water in there, not sealed, they just refilled from tap water. on breakfast, i saw some insects close to breakfast table, not hygenic at all. Regarding the reception, they dont speak english, main person manager, speak english, but quite rude, try to sell u tour around dehli, or ask to exchange currency, but bad price. If you can find a other hotel, it is better. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Extreme Caution Needed We recently returned from India after the marriage of our son in Amritsar. On our way to Amritsar we had to stay one noght in Delhi to catch next days flight to Amritsar.Our agent had advised us that he had booked this hotel for one night for us. Our flight from Kuala Lampur reached Delhi about 9.45pm and we reached the hotel about 11.30 pm to be told that the hotel was full ! A quick call to the agent got them all excited and they offerred us a room but we had to sleep on a mattress on the floor.We refused, then they walked us to a neighbouring &quot;branch&quot; of the hotel- it was dilapidated old building not worthy of being called a hotel. Then they walked us to Sunstar Crown again a few hundred metres away. By then our Agent came in and we asked to be taken to another hotel.We had a long flight from New Zealand- would never recommend anyone to book this place- it is NOT a hotel- pictures on the website are misleading.

hotel sunstar grand ,"Failed to honor booking Having booked and prepaid for the Sunstar Grand with an online booking service we confirmed the booking and arranged airport pickup with the hotel directly. On arrival in India our first dissapointment was no airport pickup. On arrival at the hotel at 3:00 AM we suffered our next dissapontment when the staff indicated the hotel was full already with was no place for us, we found a substitute hotel with the help of our cab driver.. Subsequent attempts to resolve the issue for refund of money were met with attempts to blame the incident on us for leaving the hotel when requested but not being able to be contacted when they found their mistake.

hotel sunstar grand ,"be careful we found this hotel from a tourist stand in the airport. it looked okay from the pictures and after a not so great stay in amritsar we decided to pay for a decent hotel.hotel itself is good, rooms okay if a little small but hot water and a decent bathroom made up for it. restaurant was good and on the rooftop so was nice to sit up there away from all the hustle and bustle.however.we were told how much the room would be when we checked in but on checking out the price had gone up as they hadnt told us the tax.we wanted to arrange a trip to agra and the receptionist called a man who said he could help us. we were promptly whisked away to a shop where we given some prices and basically told if we didnt book now that either the train or the drivers might not be available. the bloke also told us that he was 'approved' by the tourist board - NOT the case. we were totally ripped off but as we were only there 2days we wanted to make sure we got transport to agra and as it was night time that we were sorting this out didnt have chance to compare any other prices - the following day we found out that it wasnt an approved tourist shop so be very careful if you stay at this hotel.also check before you use the internet at this hotel as there are no signs to warn you of any charge so you could be asked for any amount of money when you logoff!hotel accomodation overall was okay it was a shame the staff werent as helpful as they could've been. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Okay for a few days We stayed at the Sunstar Grand in early March of 2007 while sightseeing in Delhi. We are non-resident Indians so we are aware of the realities of hotels in India. It was in a quiet part of the city and generally was safe. The staff was a little sluggish and seemed very eager to earn some tips, but one has to expect this when dealing with a non-luxury hotel in India, especially in a major city. Overall, the room was clean, but the bed linens were a bit worn. We had a room with a bathtub (note: note all bathrooms do), but water leaked onto the floor if you used it. Also, it was very dark in the rooms because there were not really proper windows and there were exhaust vents and a single air conditioner unit attached to the &quot;window&quot;. There was also a noisy pigeon hanging out on our AC. But I have to say, it wasn't bad- we paid about $60 a night, and in a city like Delhi you have to be realistic. It was sufficient enough for us as we were out most of the day sightseeing. Let's face it, we don't go to Delhi to stay in a hotel/resort all day- we go to see the amazing sights. (note: Agra on the other hand had a GREAT hotel- Hotel Howard Plaza). "
hotel sunstar grand ,"ok at a pinch but not out of choice small roomsOurs on ground floor had no windowsour friends' on 3rd floor smelled of disinfectant. but they were adequate.Breakfast was the worst we had in india. boiled egges, moldy toast, non descript jam, Sunny delight as juice, that it. ah yes, weak instant coffee. It would be better if the hotel went R/O.Restaurant staff were worthless. 4 or 5 staff could'nt get a table cleared for us at breakffast and the hotel was'nt full. this also happened to our friends on the second morning so we ended clearing tables ourselves.Front desk staff were slightly pushy and appeared often whenever a tip seemed extractable. Otherwise they kept away.of all hotels we used in india (7-8) this time this was 2d worst.It will do if you need spend a night but better look elsewhere. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Good Economical Hotel Nice hotel close to the city. Fairy noisy at night time but noise level just enough to get some sleep. Room and bathroom were very clean, modern and spacious. Staff friendly and helpful. Overall, a good hotel at a very reasonable price. Ideal for short stays. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"quite good and clean We stayed in this hotel twice whilst on a group tour of Northern India. Once at the beginning of the tour and then at the end of 15 days. I had looked at photos on the internet and was pleasantly surprised that our room was better than we expected. It was a good size , located at the back and had a window and good sized bathroom. It had marble floors, cable TV, tea and coffee making facilities which was good and the decor was a bit kitsch but okay. It was very clean and the linen was white and fresh and the bed fairly comfortable for India ( so many are like concrete). It was very cold in Dehli in January so we had to ask for extra blankets as the room was freezing. On our final visit our room had a lovely warm heater. It was a bit noisy and we could hear all the goings on at reception ( we were on the ground floor) and also hear people arriving at strange times in the night. The breakfast area is a bit like a dungeon below with no ambience and we were served white toast, jam, hard boiled eggs and there was a choice of a few Indian dishes. The food in the hotel was ordinary compared to what we ate at other restuarants. The location is okay but not really near anything much - the market was closed on a Monday when we were there. It is cheap to catch an auto rickshaw to Connaught Place though and the metro is nearby which is cheap and clean. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Kitsch decor pushy staff small rooms...but ok for a couple of nights Decor is kitsch, but new, modern and not unpleasant. They've tried to achieve a Swiss chalet-style effect, leading to some strange features such as wood-panel print ceramic tiles in the bathroom. There is a tight marble staircase running down the middle of the hotel and a very slow, but spacious, elevator. Rooms: are small and the bathrooms are very small.On the plus side, the fittings are all new and the room is comfortable. Cable TV. Demand a room with a window, otherwise you will probably be assigned my room (202) , which was windowless. I pulled back the curtain to find a window built into a ventilation shaft. Breakast buffet is good. The food is delicious. The buffet is served downstairs in the pool, sauna, steam room area.Ambience: Noisy. The rooms seem to have little soundproofing between them leading to some embarassment about using the bathroom when one's neighbour is in residence.BEWARE of ridiculous add-on charges when you leave. Suddenly there is a charge for use of the steam room downstairs, or the internet in the lobby. These are nonsense charges - if you didn't sign an invoice agreeing to pay it at the time - as you would with a room service bill, for example - then you don't pay it. I stood there saying 'I'm not paying for it' as each one of these silly charges came up. I had the feeling that it was a self-ennrichment measure run off the books for the benefit of the front-desk staff and bell-boys. Threaten to go to the Tourist Police if they continue to talk at you, the staff rely on your sense of politeness and dislike of confrontation to hassle you into paying more. The staff quickly backed down when challenged on these charges and when they heard me say definitively that I would not pay it.The check-out experience really soured me on the hotel. "
hotel sunstar grand ,"Get the right room We stayed there twice. The first time we got a small room (one side of the bed was against the wall so you could only get in it from the other side), with NO window and a shower room. The second time the room was bigger, had a bathroom, and windows :-) In both cases the rooms were clean. You can take a look at the hotel website, which shows pictures of various rooms. Breakfast was included and in winter is served in an unattractive room in the basement, with white neon lights and sort of shower curtains to divide it in two. We were also not impressed by the dirty plastic box with dirty crockery, which had been put on the floor by the entrance. We didn't eat much but other people seemed to enjoy their breakfast.The street is relatively quiet and not too noisy. Beware of beggars, who may try their first approach as soon as you get out of your car.Check also reviews of Sunstar Residency, as some reviewers might have confused the two hotels. "
hotel sunstar grand ,¡No lo elijas! 
hotel sunstar heritage ,"Watch out for the extra costs! This hotel has lovely clean sheets and a lift and a fridge in the room. However everything else was a bit of a let down . Watch out for the extra costs. The room charge was for bed and breakfast , but when checking out the manager was going to charge for breakfast. When using email I was asked to write my name &amp; sign the form, nothing was written on the form and I used the email for about half an hour, when finished the charge was for 2 hours because my start time had been written wrongly on the form. Watch the menu prices as the charge is not always what the menu says some of our meals were charged at twice the amount than was written on the menu (check, check, check everything). The restaraunt was awful as was the food. I wouldn't recommend this hotel because we had to keep checking all the costs and continued to find prices were always wrong. "
hotel sunstar heritage ,"Very disappointing We're not too fussy but turning up at the Sunstar Heritage after a longhaul flight at 2am to find no sheets on the bed, 1 smoky smelly towel, opened bottles of water and no hot water and the loudest air conditioning in the world that only did 1 temperature which was a polar blast - is not my idea of a hotel. We asked the manager for fresh towels the next day that never turned up and the following night we did have sheets but we were better off in our own sleep sheets. Would not recommend this hotel unless they make some changes. "
hotel sunstar heritage ,"Nice location clean hotel! I was pretty impressed with this hotel after I read other reviews. If you are looking for a comfortable place to rest your head there is nothing wrong with this hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, with great airconditioning and clean sheets and towels. The bathroom was clean and there was always hot water, which wasn't the case in many hotels I've stayed in India. The restaurant was closed when I was there and you could only have room service which wasn't brilliant, but there are so many great places to eat who cares. Although it was a little expensive I felt very safe there being on my own and the staff were very helpful. Finally the hotel is not on a very busy street, therefore it wasn't noisy at night. "
hotel sunstar heritage ,"Don't stay here Don't stay here--eerie place. Originally I was supposed to stay at the owner's other property, Incredible Home Stay (which gets pretty good reviews), but was placed here instead. The service is abysmal (as in I can't believe these people are actually in the hospitality business) although the rooms were pretty clean. Sheets were cleanly pressed, but lightly stained if you scrutinize and as I'm a bit of a germiphobe, I look closely. Bathrooms were okay (I stayed in rooms 105 and 305). What was most frustrating is that their designated taxi drivers totally rip you off--FAR better to just catch an auto rickshaw on the street outside, but if you're traveling alone as I was (female), this can be a very, very intimidating prospect at 5 am when you need to catch a 6 am train to Agra. Also, be sure to negotiate with them on price. They charged me 1800 rupees, no tax, for one night, but then tried to charge me luxury tax on the second night. (?!). Do NOT eat at the restaurant--awful food and filthy kitchen--and be aware that there was a bombing in the Karol Bagh market nearby just a few weeks ago... "
hotel sunstar heritage ,"Not a pleasant experience - Not very professional- Unless good bargain is done, you will lose- No direct booking facility. Even if you try to contact hotel directly the hotel you'll end up in contacting a travel agent who works as a contact point on many nearby hotels.- Try to avoid these broker/ middleman to save money "
hotel sunstar residency ,ok if you just need a place to sleep rooms were clean.not a great area of town (far from the center).rooms are clean and beds are ok.breakfast is a disgrace and service rivals that.acceptable if you just need a clean place to sleep. 
hotel sunstar residency ,"average decent place I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The rooms were clean. The ac was not working properly. when I told the management, they sorted that out quickly.The area karol baugh where this is situated..was noisy...and crowded.However there was a shopping area close to the hotel.There is a good eating place called Raffles.If someone is looking for a decent place but without spending too much I think this is good value for money. "
hotel sunstar residency ,"Not too bad. Good location for Metro Stayed here as it was a better location than some of the others. I have to agree it was noisy but this was due to other guests and not traffic. We had a room at the back on the 4th floor 405. Its perfectly acceptable but we did find our room unlocked on return so make sure you lock away your valuables or use the lockers in the managers office. If you leave the hotel and turn left at the front walk up the slight hill to the main road turn left and then right in 10 to 15 mins your at the Metro station Rajendra Place. The hotel business card has a small map on the back so its easy to find. Its a normal hassled walk but getting to connaught place is easy until late. The last train times are posted on the ticket booths. If you fancy coming back via tuk tuk use the pre pay booth in connaught place.Overall due to its locality to the Metro and the ease of getting to and from the city I'm recommending this hotel. The rooms were OK and clean. The shower was good and the bathroom was acceptable. AC worked. What more could i ask for. Price was 4452 rup around £53 for 2 nights. Sorry but no photos, i forgot. "
hotel sunstar residency ,"Clean rooms horrible staff no windows noisy The hotel seemed really ok at first glance, the room was clean, but ...The receptionist holds me back, saying &quot;my travel agent&quot; would be here in 2 minutes and wanted to see me about my stay in the hotel. Well, I had no travel agent, I booked the hotel through Internet.So the guy who shows up, tells me that he would be the final agent in the chain of companies through which my booking went. And of course tries to propose me excursions, additionnal services, etc... SCAM! After a few minutes he felt my mood about his presence and excused himself.I ask for a taxi at the reception, not sure if it was safe to hail one in the street at night. Of course, no problem. Well it was only three times the normal price (which I would not care so much as it was a proper, comfortable car), but it was not a taxi at all, just any private car (maybe the hotel's car that they rent out?). Guess doing taxi services without taxi license is also in India not exacly legal ...Back in my room I realise that the window is actually not a window but a window into a kind of ventilation shaft. The fan that would blow the air into that shaft (so no fresh air nto the room...) was so horribly loud that there was no way to leave it on at night.As an advantage from the airshaft you hear your neighbours as if they were in your room!Why some furniture had to be moved between midnight and 4 in the morning was a question the reception seemed unable to answer. "
hotel sunstar residency ,Stay If You Want To Be Ripped Off!!! I stayed at this hotel in March 2007. I was quoted a price for an executive suite as they said this was all they had available. It was downstairs. At first I thought it was ok as seemed clean but the noise was awful as it was on the ground floor. The only thing was the noise was from the staff playing loud music and shouting to each other all night even when I asked them to be quiet. We asked if we could move rooms and they said we could move to a room upstairs but it would be more money - which I could not understand as they were smaller rooms. When we asked if we could move later to a cheaper room they said they were fully booked. I called the hotel later that day by phone and asked if they had rooms and how much they were - they quoted me 1500 rupees less than the price I paid and said they were available. When I went back to the hotel they tried to charge me more and on checking out were shouting abuse and all sorts. I would never stay at this hotel ever again and advise anyone NOT TO STAY HERE. We are Non resident Indians and they were looking to rip us off so I can only imagine what they do to tourists!!!! 
hotel sunstar residency ,"Great place I stayed here several times while having to transit through Delhi and found it to be pretty good with minimal problems. The food was great, the service was prompt and the rooms were good. It's not for people desiring five star or even a good four star experience but it is a great choice for those looking for a nice three star place. The only downside is the neighborhood, Karol Bagh is quite chaotic and noisy....but then again all of Delhi is that way!!!! "
hotel sunstar residency ,"Not sure this is the same as Sunstar Grand I have been at Sunstar Grand. To comment on the previous review, I am not sure that Sunstar Grand and Residency are the same hotel. Looking at Sunstar Grand's website, it seems that Grand and Residency are two different hotels. They must be under the same ownership and close to each other, that's why it gets a bit confusing.I will post my review under Sunstar Grand. "
hotel sunstar residency ,"great value for the money Also known as the &quot;Hotel Sunstar Grand&quot;. Marble floors and staircase. Nice older style with good furnishings and bed for this medium price range. Clean but worn linens, good service. Plenty of water pressure. Great rooftop terrace for breakfast if you get up early (only one shady table for the latecomers) thankfully breakfast is also cheerfully delivered to your room.[--]We paid US$50/night large double with AC. Have a local friend call and reserve the room in Hindi - you'll pay less ;) "
hotel sunstar residency ,"Very good value for money This place is a good surprise, especially if you have tried the terrible Ajanta hotel before!! Our room was large, clean, confortable, the bathroom huge with an amazing bathtub... The food was also excellent and service above average. I am going back there in few days and definitely recommend it ! "
hotel sunstar residency ,"Horrible Place We stayed in Hotel Sunstar for 2 days in December and the experience was horrible. The room looked like a dungeom. Being in the busy Karol Bagh area, there is constant noice all night and several bugs allover the room. We were changed to a different room but it was only slightly better. Having paid an exhorbitant amont of money for COX and KINGS travel agency for out Delhi-Agra-Jaipur trip, we felt cheated. On requesting a different hotel, they told us to pay by ourselves, which we agreed. The travel agent called back witha hotel for 300$ saying thats the only hotel available in Delhi as it was a busy season. We checked on the Internet and got a great deal at the Grand for 125$ and there were tons of other hotels available.COX and Kings is an unreliable travel agent set to cheat unsuspecting foreigners (as we saw many Japanese staying in Hotel Sunstar).DONOT STAY THERE. DO YOUR RESEARCH. LOOK FOR DEALS. and dont become a walking ATM machine! "
hotel swati ,"KoolYaar I was with a marriage party and we had booked our rooms in this hotel. We reached the hotel in the morning, after a exhaustive journey by train from Chennai. But the service was good. And the tariff is an added attraction, really less. Considering the area (Karol Baug), the price is affordable. Service cannot be said Excellent, but considering its tariff, service provided is good.Proximity of Metro Rail is an added advantage. "
hotel swati ,"Beware: Must keep Copy of Reservation Confirmation to Avoid Extra Charges We stayed at Hotel Swati in July for two nights. It is centrally located and moderately priced. Included vegetarian breakfast is good too. Wi-Fi internet access is included in the room rate and worked on our floor without problem. I must warn about the underhanded practice by management: We had booked a &quot;SUITE&quot; with a king bed for two adults and two children with one additional bed included in the price. When we checked out, we were charged for the extra bed. The manager on duty will not remove the charge until I went on the web (thankfully they had web access in the lobby) and showed him the confirmation email mentioning no additional charge for the roll away bed. I believe they also cheated us by giving a standard room for a price of suite since the room was very small and the roll away bed had to be &quot;rolled away&quot; in morning because there would be no room to move about with the extra bed in there. I recommend inspecting all available room types upon check-in to avoid the scam..... "
hotel swati ,"Great Family Hotel We reached the hotel late at night after 10 hour drive from Fatehpur(Rajasthan). But, were stumped by the hospitality of the staff even at that odd hour. Check In was quick late night menu exhaustive and service commendable.The hotel is neat and clean with internet access facility and a well informed travel desk. "
hotel swati ,"Good City Hotel It is good city hotel tucked in the shopping area of karol bagh. I Stayed in the executive room , was decent ,spacious and clean, although air conditioner was the only ventilator for the room. It is a very professionally managed hotel , staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is 100% vegetarian but good, buffet breakfast is good and safe. The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station, which is a great boon getting around delhi. Final result , good for tourist, business , in city hotel . "
hotel swati ,"nice hotel booked the hotel online after reading tripadvisor reviewsIts cheap and you get what you pay for ,i stayed for two saysin january Had a very comfortable stay at this hotel.Good room/laundry service Execllent restuarant Excellent service through-out the stay "
hotel swati ,"Good for shopping and sights We ended our 3 week trip in Delhi having started our trip there. We had seen most of the highlight sights on our first visit so we wanted to shop and fit in the ones we had missed. This was probably the most money we had spent on a room and choose Karol Bagh over the Connaught area as prices there were a little higher and reviews not that great. This wasn’t from the Lonely Planet like most of our other choices but was a good option. We’d stayed in Paharaganj for the first visit and this is a good place as a base for sites but Karol Bagh is a little nicer if you want a bit more of a calm location. The hotel is on a street just off the main street in Karol Bagh and perfect for the Metro. It’s about 5 mins walk to the station and it’s really easy to use. Only 3 stops to Connaught Place for the shops and western restaurants and a few more to New Delhi train station. Would recommend staying in Paharaganj though if travelling from New Delhi train station next day (if early morning). We got a friendly rickshaw driver to take us to some of the shopping highlights from the Lonely Planet and of course we got persuaded into visiting some carpet shops on the way. Although this maybe many people’s choice of holiday gift it was definitely not ours and if you’re like us to be avoided. All the Government Emporiums and Government run places have very traditional and expensive saris, ornaments and never ending carpets. Delhi (apart from Paharaganj) has markets, bazaars and western shops too so perhaps go there first without the emporiums. The main street in Karol Bagh has lots of market stalls and some western clothes shops worth a visit. There’s not loads of restaurants but a few that you can go in after a hectic day in the city. Rooms as small but clean and have everything you need. The staff are helpful and no problems with anything there. "
hotel swati ,"decent stay booked the hotel online via expedia after reading tripadvisor reviews, process was quite simple and painless. was able to confirm via email which was nice since i was in nepal right before, and their website was quite comprehensive. taxi driver tried to drop me off at swati deluxe, and wouldn't go anywhere when i told him i was at the wrong hotel, until the kind doorman at the deluxe was able to inform him otherwise. when i finally arrived, they quickly greeted me with a smile and shuttled me to my room. the room itself was quite small, but with decent decor. requested a king bed, but instead got two tiny twins. aircon was right over both of the beds like 2 feet next to one, which made it impossible to actually use while in either bed. room was right next to elevator and apparently the kitchen, as all i heard all night was the ruckus of the elevator and the kitchen staff washing dishes and chatting all night which was extremely irritating. staff was fairly friendly. bathroom was small, water pressure was okay and water was warm, not hot. overall, a fairly standard, nothing spectacular. i did not get my room made up between my first and second night. an okay place to stay, if your taxi driver can find it. "
hotel swati ,"you get what you pay for Having just come back from there 2 days ago i felt i had to offer some comments.Its cheap and you get what you pay for, the rate we paid got us a room with beds and clean sheets. Beds were uncomfortable because the matress was on a wooden base. Not clearly advertised as such. The shower for the room rate we were paying was not a shower rather fill a bucket up and sponge bath yourself, but the water is hot so i guess that compensates.Its in an amazing location and when my travel companion was sick the hotel was quick to point us to a good hospital so points to them for that.However;We hired a driver from the hotel to take us to the taj mahal, he picked up a guide who was pushy, and then proceeded to do a very subtle tourist trap routine, i.e take us to shops where then guide and the driver get there cut. Very slick operation and very subtle. The comment when i complained on getting back to delhi was &quot;The hotel does not use a guide&quot; hmm sorry but the fact that we booked the tour through the hotel means that they do. Also be aware that the price for the tour is higher than if you booked through a non hotel tourist place. You will not be able to put the tour on your hotel bill you must pay cash. Obviously everyone gets there commission.My other strong criticism is we booked to go to the national museum paying for a driver etc but the driver had to stop twice to ask where the museum was and then when we asked to go to a Pizza Hut for lunch, he had to stop and ask where that was as well, driving past one before finally stopping at one. If I am paying for a driver i think its fair to give people drivers who have some knowledge of their own city. That was quite dissapointing.The custom of everyone expecting tips at the hotel was also dissapointing. Whilst i understand its part of the culture be aware that some of the hotel staff will not leave your room until you give them a tip, ie its mandatory. I was always under the impression that tipping is for good pleasant serviceIn summary, a cheap clean hotel that with a few simple changes could be so much better I think. Its great if you are only there for one or two nights but when staying for a week as I and my companion were it will start to grate on you.I love what i found in India and will be back one day but not to the hotel swati. "
hotel swati ,"Love the Swati experience Ok, so it's not a Taj, or an Oberoi or an Intercontinental. It's a decent hotel in the middle of a busy and accessible shopping area. For around $50 a night you get very good food, helpful service, and above adequate (clean) room facilities. The reason I started staying here is purely because I frequnted the hotel's Gujarati/Rajastani restaurant so often when I was in Delhi, it just made sense to stay in the hotel itself. The only problem I have is that because the hotel is located of Ajmel Khan rd, one of the main shopping areas in Delhi, I always end up spending so much on clothes, that it'll probably be cheaper for me to stay at the Hilton! But if you can show some self restraint, its definitely worth it! Seriously, I would stay anywhere else in Delhi "
hotel swati ,"Comfortable stay and nice professional staff. Had a very comfortable stay at this hotel. A/C, large bathroom &amp; shower, cable TV, refrigerator, and a sitting area in the room. Staff was very accomodating and arranged a cab for us to the airport at 0130 am. The restaurant Suruchi was excellent. Good vegetarian food and complimentary buffet breakfast. "
hotel swati ,"Great Hotel for The Area I booked an 'Executive' room in this hotel as a comfortable retreat at the end of a holiday in India - the rate was about 3000 INR (~$75 USD) by the time taxes etc were added - however I was very impressed! Rooms - Cable TV, free wi-fi, in-room safe (very rare for India), aircon, balcony (albeit onto a noisy side street), reliable hot water, complimentary bottled water (with the seals intact!), tea &amp; coffee making kit, nibbles, an evening turn-down service, comfortable bed, complimentary morning newspaper, and free breakfast. Whilst certainly not the Sheraton or Hilton, I would genuinely say that this is on a par, if not better, than many mid-range hotel rooms that I have stayed at in Western cities, and was utter bliss compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in India. Location - Situated down a side street in the middle of Karol Bagh, a large bustling market and shopping precinct, which as a auto-rickshaw driver explained to me, &quot;is where middle class Indians go shopping&quot; - plenty of bargains to find if you're willing to be adventurous and try the non-Western brands. There's western food outlets (McDonalds, Pizza Hut) nearby for those a bit short of willpower, and ATMs (complete with security guard) a short walk away. Delhi's fantastic Metro (it puts most other world metros to shame) is only a ten minute walk, is very easy to use, and most fares are about INR 10 (~$0.25 USD). The neighbourhood is very chaotic and crowded on market days, so maybe not a great choice for your first night in India if you're likely to feel culture shocked - but ideal for someone who has been in the country a few days. Noise - As it's on a side street, and not on the main market itself, the hotel is spared much of the noise and bustle. I didn't really notice much noise at all unless I went onto the balcony - absolutely fine. A great night's peaceful sleep.Service - To be honest, I had very little dealings with the staff, but check in was very efficient. All major cards are accepted, and no mysterious charges appeared on my card statement! The hotel arranged a taxi to the airport for me, which was on time, although the agreed price was INR 350 - INR 100 more than a taxi from booked from a Delhi Police booth - although there are only a handful in the city, so probably a premium worth paying for convenience's sake. Conclusion - highly recommended, definitely go for one of the executive rooms if you can - the service and standard of accommodation is superlative for its location and price point. "
hotel swati ,"Serviceable hotel in Karol Bagh This review is a year old but I have a few tips that might be useful for Hotel Swati patrons.First... there are two Hotel Swatis. Keep this in mind when the cab driver asks where you want to go. There is &quot;Hotel Swati&quot; (where we stayed and the subject of this review) which has the following address:Hotel Swati15 A / 56, W.E.A., Karol Bagh,Opp. Roopak Stores, Ajmal Khan Road,New Delhi - 110005 ( India )website: http://www.hotelswati.com/swati.htmNote: the term &quot;Opp. Roopak Stores&quot; means the hotel is kitty-corner (diagonally opposite) from a store called Roopak. This is part of the address because the street the hotel is on has no name. The hotel does NOT face Ajmal Khan road.Then there is the &quot;Hotel Swati Deluxe&quot;:Hotel Swati Deluxe17 - A / 32, Gurudwara Road , W.E.A. Karol Bagh , New Delhi : - 110005(India) website: http://www.hotelswati.com/swatideluxe.htmBoth are owned and run by the same company so be sure you know which one you're going to. Our cab driver took us to the wrong one first.Anyway - our stay here was adequate. I did not choose the hotel and now that I've read about other New Delhi hotels on TripAdvisor I wish I could have chosen something else. We had no major problems, just a few fustrations here and there.When we first arrived the man at the front desk was a little strange. We asked him if he spoke English. &quot;No&quot; he said. So my husband began speaking to him in Hindi. Suddenly the guy remembered his English. It was odd. He asked to make copies of our passports. This creeped us out but we complied. I don't know if this is standard procedure. If anyone else has had the same experience I'd like to know about it.Our room faced the street and it was very very noisy. I guess this is to be exected in a busy city like New Delhi, and may be true of nearly all hotels there. Do bring some earplugs. The horn honking begins at 6 or 7 in the morning. After a while you can ignore it. Our beds were narrow twin beds with thin mattresses. The bathroom had a western style toilet that took toilet paper. Note: If you are a toilet-paper-user -- go easy on it while in India. That said, you may want to bring some extra for yourself. If you run out of the small roll provided by the hotel you'll have to wait a whole day before it's replenished.There is a very good restaurant attached to the hotel but it is actually next door - not within the hotel itself. It doesn't open for dinner until 7pm. On our first night we got there just as they opened and were a little worried about how empty it was -- until 20 minutes later when it was full to the rafters. Seems like a very popular place with savy tourists. The meals are all thali style with no sharing. But delicious! We also had breakfast there each morning and it was fine. It was a buffet and not bad at all (there is even a toaster!). The staff can be indifferent if you have a special request (the manager was more interested in playing solitare on his laptop than answering a question I had) but just let it go.On our second day we took a hired car to Agra to see the Taj Mahal which was arranged through the hotel. The driver was supposed to be English speaking - but wasn't. Oh well. Still got us to the Taj and back in one piece. Be aware that it is a 5 hour drive and you will be picked up at 6am. It's a loooong day.When we got back from Agra all we wanted to do was order room service and crash in our beds, but when we entered the room the lights wouldn't work. Our room had no electricity, even though the rest of the hotel did. What the heck? Turns out you have to place the metal key ring in a special holder just inside your room door before the electricity will work. Clever. But it would have been nice if they had told us this when we arrived.The neighborhood is crowded but interesting. We didn't feel unsafe once we walked around a bit. I have a video I took of the street that I'll try to upload or link to here if I can.What else...? Oh there is a great metro in Delhi! There is a station within walking distance of the hotel. Ask at the front desk re the Metro. That was something they were quite helpful about.That's all I can remember. Hope this was helpful! "
hotel swati ,"Worse than Fawlty Towers I stayed here at the beginning and end of an adventure travel type tour down the Ganges. It cost about $US60 a night. First room I stayed in had blood on the sheets and when I removed the sheets couldsee the mattress was crawling with bed bugs. Went to have a shower but shower head blew off into the side of my face. On way back in a different room the air conditioner caught fire. Actually were flames shooting out of it! Took 15 to 20 minutes to get any of the staff to come and then they send the boy. No fire alarms and no evacuation of course, although they did give us another room! "
hotel swati ,"What a relief! Having come from Mumbai via Goa, we had already had great difficulty finding decent accomadation for a reasonable price. However we were so relieved to arrive at the Hotel Swati and find it was a clean, comfortable hotel with good facilities.Our room was the standard room for 2000rps a night. It was spacious with cable tv, fridge, aircon, in-room safe and comfy beds and pillows. We also discovered that there was free wi-fi internet to all the rooms which really helped us plan the next part of our trip. The restaurant serves excellent veg. Thalis and breakfast is included in the price. There is also 24hr room service.We found the staff to be friendly and helpful but not overbearing like in some places. Like everyone in India they appreciated a tip but did not hound you to hand over money.Karol Bagh is a busy noisy area but we quite enjoyed the amazing market street stalls and shops. The hotel was a little noisy but there doesn't seem to be a Delhi hotel that isn't and when I rang reception to complain about the noise from the next room they took action immediately and the noise stopped.All in all I would definately reccomend this hotel for its security and comfort at an excellent price.

hotel swati deluxe ,"Great Staff i had booked over the net into a another hotel that did not meet my expectations, so i walked around Karol Bagh and came across Swathi - immediately got my attention, clean lobby, profesional staff and very helpfull. I had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff. Good manager, front desk staff... infact all the staff were polite, helpfull and well trained...Kuddos to them ..made my stay greattt. i found the room spacious and very clean Iread about the negative reviews but i think its not fair on the staff as they go out of their way to make you comfortable.an example, they ( the manager on duty at the restaurant) even wake you up to check if you are gonna give breakfast a miss and were prepared to wait a few mins even though the time was almost up ... very personalised.Breakfast is unlimited in a veggeterian restaurant and its attendants, right down to the doorman are very professional. Plus they have another hotel around the corner with fantastic Rajistani food..Location - Its in the middle of Karol Bagh - close to shops, food outlets, metro station ( a must try) In addition to that the nternet Wifi is free (and working). Plus a computer near the front desk which helped me serach abt whr to go, eat etc whilst waiting for transport..Overall very happy with the hotel - would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone who wants a safe place to stay.

hotel swati deluxe ,"Swati Deluxe - basic hotel with great vegetarian foodcourt We stayed at the Swati Deluxe at both the start and end of an Intrepid tour. We found the location to be very good - close a metro station. The shops around were very interesting to us - a great sweet shop nearby and the Karol Bagh markets (clothes, belts, bags etc) a block away. The rooms were basic 3 star. On our first stay, one of the rooms had a broken chain (the door could be locked but I like to have a security chain). On our second stay, we were kindly allocated rooms with an interconnecting door. The rooms also seemed to have been updated which I understand was happening progressively throughout the hotel. The staff at the hotel were efficient and seemed very busy. Some staff were quite friendly. There was quite a deal of noise at night, although the second stay was quieter due to location of rooms.The highlight for us was the vegetarian food court next door. We loved the food and ate several meals there because there was a great variety. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Good Hotel With all 4 Star Aminites After having considerable difficulty locating a business (70-$100) hotel in Delhi for a personal visit, we settled on the Swati Deluxe Hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor.We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff.1) They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup. They come in an Logan(comfortable car) so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance.2) Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean. Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what $60-70 per night can get you in Delhi. The area around the hotel is great (in the middle of Karol Bagh) - that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp. the courteous staff.Car parking is and bus parking facility is also their.3) The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional.4) We had made taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing from hotel . 5) Best part is internet Wifi is free,and also business center is also free.6) They a good vegetarian food court in the name of &quot;Shudh&quot; ,and also they have specialty restaurant in the name was &quot;Suruchi&quot;.Overall very happy with the hotel - would definitely stay there again if going thru' Delhi on personal visit.or Business visit.

hotel swati deluxe ,"Good Location Average Service I liked the location. Close to the Metro Station, Restaurants. But the hotel can get its act together for Cleanliness and Service. May not stay again as there are better places. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Very Decent Hotel and Helpfull Staff I had a good stay here. Of course, I got upgraded to a suite and hence could not experience the regular rooms, but the place was quite decent.As I remember, my bill also came about 9,000 lesser than my last stay in Delhi. I will stay in this place for my future travel as long as they extend the same facilities – discounts etc.ThanksHemanthemail:-subramanya.ma@tycoelectronics.com "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Above average price for a below average hotel. This hotel is located near to a metro and there are alot of similar hotel with same pricing nearby. Please bear in mind that the hotel will charges 22.5% of taxes for the price shown on the pamphlet. Remember to ask for a discount if you arrive late at night. Ovearall, it is a below average hotel. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Decent stay There are a multitude of mid-range hotels in Delhi and the Swati Deluxe is a good choice. One piece of advice regarding hotels in India -- bear in mind that their idea of 3-star may not be what you expect. The hotels are clean and the staff are usually friendly, but it's not going to be in line with what you would expect in the States or in Europe. I would say that the mid-range hotels in India are about on par with economy motels in the States. After the marathon flight, the staff at Swati Deluxe were welcoming. The hotel is a little difficult to find, so be sure you have specific directions/information to provide to your driver. The rooms are clean and they provided towels each day. The attached restaurant has very good selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We found it very convenient and enjoyable. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"A RAT ate my apple!!! Our first night in India, the hotel gave us a fruit basket which consisted of an apple and a banana. We left it on our TV stand and during the night I could hear gnawing sounds! I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but in the morning we saw that the apple was half eaten! BEWARE! Small 3-occupancy rooms and no working shower heads. The only positive is the buffet breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Good location but poor service The hotel was well located, near restaurants and shopping. When we checked into the hotel at 2100, someone was in the room that they gave us. They then cleaned the room while we waited, but they didn't even change the sheets. The room was quite dirty, with hairs all in the rumpled sheets and trash still in the trash can. Also we felt like the staff were not very helpful when we raised our concerns that the room not being clean and waited around waiting on bakeesh, even after just cleaning the room. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Great place to stay Myself and three friends stayed in the Swati Deluxe on three seperate occasions during the months of December 06 to January 07. We originally found this hotel through our travel group, Intrepid, though we returned to it when we were travelling independently.The rooms are clean and comfortable with decent hot water, though you will need to switch on a seperate hot water tap before the main hot water tap has hot water (this is India, after all!). Room service and a telephone (capable of international calls) is available in all rooms.I can highly recommend this hotel because of its very helpful staff. We left literally mounds of luggage with them for weeks on end, and they were only too happy to keep it for us.They unfailingly organised endless taxis, tours and so on for us and told us what we should expect to pay. The friendly staff were only to eager to go the extra mile and carry our luggage and so forth.Just behind the hotel is the wonderful Karol Bagh market, which is lively at night and has great shopping by day, including a Levi's outlet and Spycar jeans. They will take up the hems for free. The two males travelling with us had extremely high quality suits tailored at Sethi's for a fairly low price ($400 for my partner, for full suit and 5 tailor made suits in high quality wool from Scotland).The foyer has free, reasonable-speed internet available. The only downside is that the one &quot;internet cafe&quot; nearby has a group of lazy teenagers working there who never want to switch on the computers for you and so tell you they are &quot;closed&quot; (this happened three times). We had to catch a rickshaw across town for internet.The hotel is a hub for Intrepid tours and so is a good place to meet like-minded travellers. "
hotel swati deluxe ,"Swati Deluxe Karol Bagh For the ones who want to have a nice stay in Delhi, the Swati Deluxe is a very well located hotel, in the market center of Karol Bagh. It's not very expensive, and the rooms are okay, clean at least, with western facilities. You find very good and inexpensive restaurants in the area, but don't go to the restaurant just beside the hotel (the hotel will send you to that place for breakfast, but it's not good and it's very expensive !!!) Better go to the restaurant Crossroad of Bengals sweets... :) You can make arrangements for transportation with the hotel directly, but there is a subway station close. Swati Deluxe is a safe place and you can book online directly on their website. "

hotel tara palace ,"Great escape from old delhi Very good service, big clean rooms, food ok, free breakfast. The only downside is the price but Delhi is expensive anyway. "
hotel tara palace ,"Good location for a good price As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is located down a dark and dirty alley off the cycle market in Old Delhi. There is a full-time security guard at the door, though we didn't feel unsafe (if I were on my own that may have been different).You get what you pay for - the rooms are basic, dark, and small. But they are clean, cheap, and the hotel is ideally situated for visiting the fort, mosque, and bazaars of Old Delhi. The hotel is also quite noisy. Our room had a shaft outside the window that must have gone up to the kitchen, so we were able to hear people for most of the night / early morning. Also, there is a window above the door that lets light in throughout the night. We ate in the restaurant during our stay. The hotel does not serve alcohol, but they will send someone out to get beers for you (at Rs 120 each). The food was decent and reasonably priced. Breakfast was included in the cost, and although not very substantial, it was fresh and sufficient.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for reasonable accommodation in Old Delhi. It is not spectacular, but it was good enough for one night. "
hotel tara palace ,location is bad This place is like only for backpakers” not for family with young teenage children. The people in the street near hotel pass bad comment on women and girls. Bad area hotel though 
hotel tara palace ,"Not bad if you want to visit Mosque and Fort Hotel is situated in the old Delhi, meaning if you like to be in a quiet neighborhoud, forget about it. However the hotel is in a small street and rooms are quiet.Old Delhi is really messy, and it can be a little harsh on your first day. However, it is ideally situated if you want to visit Delhi fort and Mosque.Hotel is clean, and bed is comfortable and hard at the same time. We slept ok.The restaurant is not good, so don't go.Service was nice enough (not amazing though). "
hotel tara palace ,"SECOND STAY IN HOTEL TARA PALACE. LOVE IT I visit Delhi every year to help with a small charity called 'Butterflieschildrights' and have stayed in several hotels. This is by far the very best place I have ever stayed in. It is clean, friendly and the food is really good. I am a female of 65 years and feel really safe. I have been made to feel so welcome and the staff are really caring. You don't need to stay in really posh hotels as there is no guarantee you will get the cleanliness or service you would pay for.Whilst I agree that the passage way can feel a little daunting, if you smile and say namastar to every one they are fine. I will be staying here every time I come to Delhi and know it will be like coming home. What more can you want. "
hotel tara palace ,"“not well maintained” It’s a new hotel but not was built &amp; maintained. Furniture is good, rooms are small sized, bathroom tiles are dirty and W/C back is also dirty. Ok hotel but needs thorough cleaning and funigation. "
hotel tara palace ,"Clean and tidy hotel Had booked this hotel on the internet. We were a bit doubtful when we arrived in the dark. The area is alive and very busy and the alleyway to the hotel a bit daunting. But once inside we found a very helpfu staff and travel bureau. The bedrooms are spacious, very clean and the bedding was changed daily. The bathrooms were spotless. The restaurant served a very good selection of food. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is an interesting if lively area to wander around during the daytime. "
hotel tara palace ,The place in Old Delhi This hotel is a real find. And in the middle of the noise and madness of old Delhi.It has a very helpful staff who immediately put your fears to rest when you find yourself in a Charles Dickens like neighborhood. Some fine restaurants in the area were recommended (Karim&quot;s with Mughal food is a Delhi institution since 1947). The attached travel agency was oneof the best I have found in a long time. The agent Rameez sorted out all my problems in no time flat and made sure that I was not taken by any taxis or touts. I will stay here again in January and get Rameez to help with all my travel plans for another month in India. He is fast at getting everything right. Better than I ma with the bookings in one spot...Just wish they had wifi in the rooms.. 
hotel tara palace ,"Amazing place right in the middle of old Delhi Has a free pick up from the airport/kamikaze driver from the paradise of India (Kashmir) who drove wildly through the night streets of early morning Delhi. In the middle of an old quarter of Delhi which is run down is a modern hotel - extremely clean and cheap with a lot of helpful staff. Breakfast a bit poor, but the view from the terrace of Red Fort, Jama MAsjid and a Jain temple as well the life in the old quarter is delightful and priceless. A must for anyone wanting to expereince the real India at first hand. "
hotel tara palace ,"A Bright Star Indeed Spent one day with my family here on arrival to India. They had a driver waiting at the airport. Very efficient, personable service, great rooms. You can take your valuables like laptop to the front desk for security. Tremendous views of the old city from the rooftop. Nice clean rooms with good bathroom and prompt room service.First time visitors might find the approach to the hotel a bit disconcerting being in a side alley near the fort, but your fears will dissolve once you enter the lobby. Took away one star on account of the ordinary food served in the restaurant. Otherwise, its just awesome and highly recommended for anyone visiting old Delhi or catching a train from there. "
hotel tara palace ,"Fab Place to Stay in Delhi We arrived in Delhi as our first stop for our tour of India, although the taxi that we had arranged to pick us up was 1.5 hours late when you see he traffic its quite understandable and dont let it put you off. The alley to the hotel is off putting but again once you get to the hotel it is well worth it.The hotel was clean and the staff very welcoming. The restaurant food is good if you dont want to venture out in the evening looking for places to stay.The roof top is a must and if you like a beer the staff will bring you a table and chair to sit and admire the view, peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle.A fab place to stay in Delhi - dont miss it the best bit is the wonderful welcoming staff "
hotel tara palace ,Noisy Stayed for 2 nights with my girl friend and surrounding place is very crowded and noisy. Lot of poor people baggers in the area and irritate you to heights. 
hotel tara palace ,"""DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH"" The path leading up to Hotel Tara Palace looked shady; I was totally doubting this place, but since it was late at night I thought its better to have a room to stay in as opposed to looking for one in the dead of night. This smart decision proved to be one of many during my trip. Another smart decision was consulting the in-house travel agent – Rameez who tailor made a tour for me. One of the places he sent me to was the controversial un-safe for tourists ‘KASHMIR.’ It turned out to be a smart decision. Kashmir reminded me of the valleys I had seen during my travel through Europe. Its fresh mountain air, green open spaces, and abundance of water was a great find. Overall this trip was full of smart decisions! "
hotel tara palace ,"A gem in the hectic chaos that is Old Delhi This was our first stop in Delhi and whist arriving to it is a culture shock (Old Delhi is chaos) the hotel is a clean and tidy oasis. The alley to the hotel is not the most welcoming approach but once inside it is soon forgotten.The room was well air conditioned and clean and the bathroom was a rather dated wet room but clean and served its purpose. The shower did not always have hot water, seems to be available more in the morning than at any other time.The rooms are basic, but adequate but ours lacked a window which meant it was very quiet but certainly not a room you would want to spend alot of time in. To be honest it was ideal room to get over a long journey - it was so quiet we slept uninterupted for over 12 hours! The AC worked very well.The hotel has a 24 hr restaurant at good prices. The food is good homemade cooking (the sort your mum would make if you have a Punjabi mum!) very tasty, The breakfast is complimentary, if you have Indian breakfast then all is good, continental style is a little more confused, but does the job.The staff are excellent. The hotel has a roof terrace. You can eat and drink up here and its a great place too see Old Delhi at roof top height. The location of the hotel is excellent for the Red Fort, the Mosque, Chandi Chowk and shopping and the Sikh Temple.The hotel has a travel desk and will book train tickets for a small fee but well worth it.Would stay here again - certainly appeared to be one of the better hotels in Old Delhi. "
hotel tara palace ,"Highly Recomended Hotel Tara Place It was my first time in india and i decided to go Old Delhi myself and i chose this Hotel Tara Palce and i don’t regret my decision as i was a single girl they gave me a family atmosphere and i felt so comfortable and safe...my room was very clean and food was delicious and the location was beautiful with view of Red Fort and Jama Masjid. Staff great, Special RAMEEZ helped me with some other travel isues..Deffinatly will be back again.Highly recomended for female travelers. Thanks you Rammez for all what you did for me and i will come back soon..... "
hotel tara palace ,"Be wary We chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor, especially the review on the travel agent Rameez that plans and books tours of the North. Firstly we were suppose to be picked up from the airport and there was no one to meet us, we called 3 times and waited 1 1/2 hrs for a pick up.The location of the hotel is down an alley way and it beats me as to how they managed to get the photos of the hotel that they have on their website as it looks nothing like it. I did not like the area in Old Delhi and didn't like leaving the room, i found the men in the area looked at me as a western woman like i was scum, even though i was with my husband i was still shoved on the street. I found the area to be very disgusting and dirty.We booked a trip with Rameez and he was very helpful but i would suggest to anyone to make sure you confirm everythinhg with him and ask lots of questions. We have found that these travel agents are very quick to say no problem Madam!. We did a tour of Varinassi, Agra and Rajastan, i would recommend to take your time on the trip we found alot of the time in the mornings was driving to the next destination, you get there in the early afternoon, do your sight seeing rather rushed in the late afternoon, sleep the night and you are off again the next morning. We were assured that we can change the itinery at any time, which we did as we got too tired moving on every day, but the hotels werent confirmed and we would arrive in places like Jodhpur and the hotel had no booking for us and we ended up having to chase this up with Rameez and got a horrid room in the end with no TV and A/C that we had paid for. They tend to make lots of excuses and pass the buck, so confirm confirm confirm!!!!!The hotel that was booked in Varinassi was too far away from the Ghats, because you were out of the town you were at the mercy of the travel agent who works for this company, i would recommend to ask for a guest house closer to the Ghats so you can be a part of everything that is going on and not have to pay for taxi's to go everywhere.As for the hotel the rooms are very spacious, hot water in the shower, good room service.Just be wary booking a trip and check all details thoroughly. "
hotel tara palace ,"Wonderful hotel in old Delhi The Tara Palace is a great little hotel! The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and large, and the food is good. Breakfast is included and I recommend the Indian breakfast of parrathas. The airport pick-up worked flawlessly, which was great since we arrive at 8PM. The location is in the middle of Old Delhi, not on the normal tourist trail,i which can be intimidating for newcomers. But I walked by myself as late as 10PM and had no trouble at all. It is only blocks from the Chandni Chowk market, a classic old-style Delhi market full of wonderful surprises down the many side alleys. It is THE place to buy a sari (if you are looking) or lots of other things and is awesome to walk around. The Red Fort is also just a few blocks away and is a must-see. If you stay here, be sure and check out the roof. It is a great place to check out another view of the city and the hotel staff will bring you tea or even your whole meal up here. For the price (and if you want to see the real Delhi) this is a great hotel and nxt time in Delhi I am staying here again. BTW, I am a 55 year old white American. "
hotel tara palace ,"A Special Place to see the real Delhi If you want to see real Delhi this is the place. It is a clean, comfortable well presented hotel with pleasant and helpful staff. Room pleasant but no view, aircon ok and not too noisy.Location down a little side street may seem quite intmidating but I found this was not the case at no time did I feel at risk. What is special is that not only can you see Red Fort and other sites from roof but the atmosphere of the area. During the day hotel located iin bicycle market which is lively. At night it becomes a fruit and vegetable market with sellers setting up pitches on the road side with camping lights to display their products. The area just comes to life and you can see the real Delhi in one place. "
hotel tara palace ,"Nice and safe place Nice and cheap hotel. The rooms are clean and you're just in the middle of old town, not so far from metro line. We stayed there 3 nights, avoid the room near the kitchen because they're always at work. "
hotel tara palace ,"A nice place to stay in the heart of Old Delhi ! We booked the first night of our tour in India and the pick up at the International Airport: they were there to wait for us, which was a good start indeed. :)The hotel is clean, the staff efficient and helpful. The location of the hotel could appear at the first glance not very safe, as the place is very crowed, but we felt safer wondering on foot there than in Paharganj. "
hotel tara palace ,"In the heart of the old city Very clean rooms, confortable after a crazy day on the streets of old Delhi, very quiet, nice and allways available staff to help you with anything you need. The location couldn't be better. Great food, we could say it was one of the best food we ate in India.Great value for price. "
hotel tara palace ,"Old Delhi Palace We chose this hotel because it looked quite nice for its price, and the location was quite interesting for a first contact with India, the hotel itself on a alley in the middle of old Delhi, in walking distance to the Red fort, the big mosque, and the NDLS and DLI railway stations. The rooms are clean and tidy, the neighborhood is quiet and the staff is nice and helpfull, the restaurant has excellent food, maybe the best food we ate in India, available 24h a day! "
hotel tara palace ,"Fantastic stay at the Tara Palace Our experience of this hotel started at the airport. The driver was there to welcome us, he was friendly and informative. The front desk staff were outstanding, they were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. All our special requests had been arranged prior to arrival. The rooms were very clean and well appointed and security was very high on their list of priorities. The 24 hr restaurant and room service was a definite plus point for this property, the waiting staff were efficient and friendly. All in all, a well run hotel.Mark Walker - Goa "
hotel tara palace ,"Great Hotel to Begin an Indian Journey! This hotel was our first stop in India on a month backpacking trip, sure there are cheaper hostels but it was nice to have the pick up from the airport and the security of knowing someone was waiting for us when our flight arrived at night (and we were late out of the airport because they lost our luggage!!!) Everyone in the hotel was helpful and we could literally order great food at any hour of the day and the food was delicious!!! the men at the front desk were very helpful- gave us internet for free, gave us directions places, on our second day there we met a man named Rameez, that if I can remember works for adventure travel company (his office is attached to the hotel) Rameez sat down with us and we figured out exactly where we wanted to go for the month and together we decided what kind of class of hotels we were willing to stay in, we booked ALL our train tickets (which he had available for us the next day!!!) He then organized a cab to drive us for the next 7 days of our journey to Agra then on to the Rajasthan province! He was very helpful, funny and excellent with English, he will listen to what you wish to do, and honestly gives you a decent rate, throughout our whole trip if there were any issues with our booked hostels or tickets (including flights) we could contact him at any time, he really helped us two girl travelers out ALOT!!!!! Sooo many positives, only negative- make sure you get the hotels you want (ie. if you want to stay in the shopping area or if you want to stay away from other tourists, or if you want to go where all the other backpackers are!!!!! BE CLEAR!!!! Also if there is an area you want to tour and do on your own and pick your own hostel for the night, be sure to let Rameez know and he will plan around any schedule you give him!!!!!! Overall like I said a great place to start the trip and with helpful workers and their travel office to arrange your trip you should have no problems!!! We didn't and have deeply appreciated the help this company has given us!!! "
hotel tara palace ,"Good value for money! Hotel Tara Palace website: www.tarapalacedelhi.comMe and my wife stayed three nights at Tara Palace on two seperate occasions in July 2009 as part of a sightseeing trip (golden triangle).Following is a list of pros and cons as well as general notes on the hotel and its service:The Pros- If you want to be in Old Delhi (or near the Red Fort), the location is good- Cheapest hotel in it's class that I could find- Very neat and tidy rooms with good airconditioning- Away from busy streets (See notes below though)- Check-in / out fairly easy. No hidden costs, credit cards accepted.- As per their website no extra taxes were added later on.- Free airport pick-up- Complimentary breakfast (Not great, but acceptable)- Room service menu at very cheap prices- 15 minutes complimentary internet usage downstairs- Elevator to all floorsThe Cons- If youve never been to India or a third world country, the location might not be suitable for you- No leeway with pick-up / drop-off (see notes)- Travel agent slightly pushy (but probably just doing his job)Notes (Please note that most budget hotels in Delhi will have some or all of these issues)- Hot water only available one of the three days (it was 40 deg C outside though)water pressure in shower acceptable though.- Try not to stay on the third floor. The kitchen and restaurant are here and there is a lot of noise echoing through the corridors till the early hours of the morning.- NIght staff can be quite unfriendly compared to the day staff- They are willing to do a free pickup from the airport (22km away) but not from New Delhi Train Station (3km away)- They refused to change the complimentary pick-up (that we did not get) into a complimentary drop-off at the airport (Rs300 extra).- Late check-out will cost half the daily room rate (Check-out is 12:00)They will kepp your bags though if you want to collect them later.- The photos of the rooms on their website are quite accurate.- Very little soap/shampoo are provided (bring your own)- Toilet paper is limited, but they will bring more if you askTravel agent(All hotels in Delhi has their own travel desk - they will all try to sell you the world: BEWARE!)- The travel agent tried his best to get us to cancel our prepaid train tickets to Agra and Jaipur and suggested we hire a car with a driver from him. He said the train to Agra takes more than three hours. (It actually takes exactly 2 hours as advertised). He said a car will only take 3 hours (actually its closer to 5 hours, sometimes more). He tried to get us to cancel hotel reservations and use his reccomendations.JUST SAY NO THANKYOU!- We paid Rs1500 for an A/C car and driver for a full day of sightseeing. It is difficult to organise this by yourself and the agent knows this - however, this price can be negociated. Also insist that if you hire a driver, an airport/station drop-off is included.You will still have to tip the driver as he doesnt see any of the money you pay to the agent.Summary:Pleasant stay in general with minor annoyances. If you can get past the location of this hotel (or even if you want to stay in Old Delhi) it is great value for the money.General Tips for this area:- There is a Metro train station 750m from the hotel. It can be tricky to find yourself (ask the locals), otherwise 5min by auto rickshaw, appr. Rs20-30 (you have to haggle)- No matter what they tell you, the Red Fort is only 400m on foot. Jama Masjid is 500m away. (Get a map from the travel desk)- Pre-paid auto-rickshaw from NDLS to hotel is Rs62. From hotel to NDLS you will have to haggle VERY hard for this price. The hotel will not go lower than Rs300 to call a taxi for you.- There are very little taxis/auto-rickshaws right outside the hotel, you'll find most on Chandni Chook.- It is expected that you tip everyone: Doorman, security guard (tip them when you check out), the two people that cary your one suitcase to AND from your room, waiters, etc. Always carry Rs10 notes with you, they are handy for tipping.- For Google Earth users: here is the location of the hotel: 28°39'16.95&quot;N 77°14'3.82&quot;E "
hotel tara palace ,"Hidden Gem ! My wife &amp; I booked a flight to Delhi (from Kolkata) with a 4-day stopover on the way to Mumbai, with the express intent to see the Taj Mahal in Agra. At first, a contact in Delhi recommended us another moderately-priced hotel near the airport, where we stayed for 2 nights. Being from America and not used to the water, we succumbed to diarrhea at that hotel, so we were anxious to move to a cleaner hotel for the rest of our 2 night stay, even if it meant paying more. Unfortunately, when we read reviews of even hotels priced 3 to 4 times higher, but we found inconsistencies in reader satisfaction versus the star ratings and the hotel's price. So we decided to focus on reader reviews for cleanliness as one of the prime criterion for our hotel selection in addition to price. We found that Hotel Tara Palace had high marks from most readers on this score *and* it was reasonably priced! The con that most of these readers had to say was that it was hard to find as it was down a narrow alley way in the old part of town. We, therefore, ensured that we had the hotel manager talk to the taxi driver on our mobile phone (we got a pre-paid Airtel phone as soon as we could in India), and have his person meet the taxi at the entrance to the lane where the hotel was. Aside from this, and the fact that the hotel is about an hour (or more depending on traffic) away from the airport, we were thoroughly pleased with the hotel, including its cleanliness, its food, and amenities, etc. It must be said, that we picked the most expensive room (Rs. 1800 per night (double occupancy) on the top (3rd floor) of the hotel with a window view of the old city), by-passing the lower priced ones entirely as we needed to rest and recover from our &quot;tummy problem&quot; and the overpowering heat at this time of the year. (The monsoons were delayed this year.) The desk staff booked us an airconditioned private taxi to take us to Agra and back (a full-day trip to see the Taj Mahal, and definitely worth it). The train or A/C bus would have been cheaper, but you are at the mercy of their schedule and availability of reservations (which at a moment's notice can be hard), else we were open to that option, but couldn't avail of that mode of transport. We found the room to be spacious, the bedsheets and towels and the bathroom to be clean and bright (with enough lights), and, of course, a remote controlled A/C (we had to put in a new set of batteries) and a ceiling fan. There was no bathtub, but the bathroom was clean with a hot shower (hot water upon request). (Although, the normal cold water was comfortable enough for a shower, as the outside day temp. was up to 47 deg. C.) The floors were of inlaid marble, and the entrance door to the rooms were of inlaid marquetry wood. Really gorgeous!Room (food) service was 24/7. The food was good. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would recommend it to most foreigners traveling on a budget.A. B. "
hotel tara palace ,"Incredible India! I managed to find Tara Palace after a lot of wrong turns! But it was totally worth it! The alley leading up to the hotel is totally sketchy, but once you walk it a few times its fine! My room was pretty basic, and the overall service was decent. One thing i need to commend was the brilliant, advice, and help i received in planning and working out the details of the rest of my time in India! Tara Palace had whetted my appetite and laid the bar for the facilities i wanted to stay in, the service i expected, and the price i wanted to pay. At the in-house travel desk a guy named Rameez Badyari greatly helped me out. He helped me to efficiently plan the rest of my trip in India by presenting me with many options that suited me and my needs! I am satisfied and will be coming back to Tara Palace! "
hotel tara palace ,"The best place to feel being in real India with the necessary comfort I warmly recommend the place to people who want to be in Old Delhi with security and comfort. It isn't luxurious but very comfortable (good beds, hot water, internet, good services, guardrobe with your own key....) You feel at home, all the staff is very friendly and the manager keeps to his word. We were supposed to stay 3 days and felt so much at ease that we remained till the end of our stay in Delhi. "
hotel tara palace ,"All Around Good Experience - A rarity in India This was my first trip to India and was feeling a tad overwhelmed by the population, by the heat, by the traffic, by my feelings of being so utterly different from everyone. I booked by hotel reservation well in advance, but was told by my taxi driver that he &quot;didn't know where Hotel Tara Palace was&quot; despite my having a good address. Finally, after asking several people for directions, I found it . It turned out to be this very peaceful oasis of friendly faces that went out of their way to be helpful and reassuring. In particular, I want to say a HUGE thanks to Rameez Badyari, a polite and knowledgeable young man who manned their travel desk. I had several places I especially wanted to visit and he helped me to logically organize my trip so that I could manage to see everyplace in a relatively short time. He booked my train tickets and hotels and suggested some off the beaten track places he thought I would enjoy seeing. I heartily recommend staying at Tara Palace and by all means talk to Rameez. "
hotel tara palace ,"Tara Palace - good clean hotel in Old Delhi I booked 2 nights at Tara Palace based on the recommendations from TripAdvisor and other sites. I was to arrive in the late evening and this was my first time in India, so I asked them to send a car to pick me up at the airport and sure enough, there was the guy with the sign (ny name just recognisable!) at the exit, which was reassuring. We drove through the Delhi night and arrived at the entrance to the alleyway where Tara Palace is located - the alley looks unwelcoming, if not actually dangerous, but the hotel is there. The staff were polite, spoke good English and got me to my room with a minimum of fuss - this was about 1am by now. The room was clean and quiet - no complaints. The window opened into a small gap between buildings, so there's no view to look out on but the aircon worked and there's a roof patio which offers a great view of Old Delhi.Breakfast is included - Western-style or Indian, as you prefer - and was perfectly OK. Tara Palace is very close to the Jama Masjid mosque and the Red Fort - there are great views of both from the roof. Old Delhi is what I'd imagined it to be - bustling, crowded, full of stimulating sights and sounds and, happily, almost entirely devoid of the tourist-oriented commercial hassle that spoils so many popular destinations. I met a few other guests while I was at the hotel and the locals in the area were generally polite and helpful, although you need to keep your eyes open when walking on the street because the traffic, especially the cycle rickshaws, doesn't follow the rules of the road that you might expect in a Western city!I used the internet PC that's located in the reception area of the hotel to check e-mail etc, although I found I couldn't upload from my USB device - a very minor drawback. On my last day at Tara Palace, I arranged to leave my luggage while I wandered around Old Delhi and at the end of the day, the hotel called a taxi to take me on to the airport.The hotel was reasonably priced and clean, the staff were helpful, the food was good and I had no cause to complain about anything. If you plan to stay there, you might do well to get taken there by car/taxi/coach rather than try to make your own way, as it's a little way off the main road through and you could walk right past the alleyway and not see the hotel sign. All in all, I would be happy to stay at Tara Palace again. "
hotel tara palace ,"An oasis of calm in Old Delhi I stayed here twice, the first time was planned and the second was because I wanted to see more of Old Delhi. If you want to get to know Delhi properly it is your best choice - you will get up close and personal with it!I can see that the location could be a bit intimidating on first sight but the bicycle market is a fabulous place and the people are brilliant.The hotel was excellent. It's clean and comfortable, the staff are fabulous - they want to help and don't try to sell at all costs. The food was as good as any I tasted on my trip and the waiters were great guys.The front of house team were also first class - you can trust their travel desk to do the best for you and to give advice without expecting a sale.I'll be back, it's high on my list favourites! "
hotel tara palace ,"Hotel Tara Palace Review This hotel was out of the way, in Old Delhi. I will admit to being a little bit sceptical at first, when the taxi driver drove to this place, and pointed down a dark alley to the entrance. Even though the location wasn't fantastic, the service was quite good. A couple of the guys spoke decent english, and communication wasnt too much of a problem. Being an Aussie, I asked for a couple of beers at 10.30pm when I arrived, and they supplied them no problem. The continental breakfast was adequate, but the resteraunt serves vegetarian only.The first morning, talked to a young bloke called Rameez, who organized tours around the city, and to Agra ( 5 hour drive away)Overall a decent, economical hotel. Don't expect much nightlife around. But it is good as a base to see the cities landmarks "
hotel tara palace ,"What a sweet clean deal loved the rooftop view! First time to Delhi, so many surprises upon arrival.The last thing we wanted was a dirty scary hotel. Don't worry when you pull up and have to walk down a dark narrow street- it is back there. We LOVED Hotel Tara! Clean, quiet, good breakfast (included), nice shower, great rooftop view! We ( 2 women) woke up and walked around Old Delhi for an hour taking in the sights and ALL the people. Perfect hotel, especially for the price!! "
hotel tara palace ,"Budget hotel for those who don't mind that sort of thing. We're a family of five (39,36,15, 9, and 7) and we booked this hotel based on the reviews here. Here's our take:This was our first trip to India and we decided to skip the tour groups and set it up ourselves. We booked Tara Palace online off of their website and the room was immediately charged in full on my credit card (We paid $35 per night per room). We booked 3 nights (the first 2 nights of our trip and the last night when we returned to Delhi). We booked a car and driver who picked us up from the airport but wasn't familiar with Tara Palace. After a phone call to a friend, we headed the hour drive from Indira Gandhi airport to the hotel. The hotel was called en route and porters helped us take our bags from the car and down the dark alley. OK. Let's talk about this alley a bit more. The hotel is situated in the &quot;old cycle market&quot; where vendors are selling their wares and tires hang from shopkeeper's hooks. Tara Palace has a large neon sign from their roof which can be seen from a mile away but when closer to the hotel, there's just a 4'x8' sign at the alley's entrance. Into the alley and you'll see closed shop doors and an old bar entrance called &quot;King Kong&quot; (no longer in business). The alley then does a quick left and right turn and after another 20 feet you'll get to the hotel's door. A friendly security guard opens the door for you and you're then into the tiny lobby.The lobby had a couch, a tv usually turned to the local cricket game, reception desk, and a free internet connected computer (this can be used in 15 minute increments and was always available which was nice as the hotel didn't have wifi). Check-in didn't take long and we were soon off to our rooms, numbers 205 and 204. The hotel has an elevator but usually we opted for the stairs as it was as quick. Now for the rooms. The first thing I noticed when I entered was the smell. The hotel must mitigate an insect problem with moth balls as the bathroom's sink and floor drain had a couple a piece. At first, keeping the bathroom door closed was fine enough (unless we wanted to use the bathroom), but after a while, I did something that I cautiously recommend. I flushed the moth balls down the toilet which got rid of the smell. Sorry, Tara Palace, that was me. Speaking of which, western toilets and TP were there and there was the ubiquitous spigot and bucket as well as a built-in toilet bidet thingy which never worked in any of the rooms. The shower needs to be run a couple minutes before getting hot and didn't have the best of water pressure. The floor is pretty much flat in the bathroom so expect to get most of the floor wet including area around the toilet. (There was also the bucket system available but since I was too embarrassed to ask the clerk how to do that, I dealt with wet floors). The beds were adequate. The basic white sheets with a scratchy fiber sheet on top. They were relatively clean (although one room had a visible stain set-in on it, they were washed at least). The mattresses are firm but we found that to be on par with the rest of the hotels we stayed in in India (from low-end to high-end hotels). There are no extra sheets or pillows supplied in the room either. The rooms had functioning air conditioners and ceiling fans which only work with the key inserted in the wall. We were in three rooms altogether 204 and 206 (and 216 instead of 204 on our return visit). If you get these rooms, don't expect a view from your window. To be more specific, don't book this hotel if you want a window to look out onto anything. One had a window in the bathroom which if opened would look into the hallway, the other looked into a small 4'x4' hole that went up to the roof. Also, the rooms have a dormer window over the room's door. In 205, this wasn't a problem for me as the room was L-shaped and the bed didn't have a view of the door. The other 2 rooms were square shaped and as such, the hall lights shone through the frosted glass and lit up the room. A free breakfast comes with the room (up to 2 per room, since we had 5 people, we were charged 99 rupees for the extra). Order the american breakfast which included a one egg omelet, toast with jelly, a small bowl of corn flakes with hot milk, and mango juice. Why, with all of these negatives, am I giving this hotel a high rating? The first is the price. Delhi's hotel prices are a bit higher than other cities and this was a good price for a clean hotel. The other part is its location. The morning after arriving in Delhi and spending a night in Tara Palace, we woke up around 5am and took a long walk around the area. We discovered that we were very close to Chandni Chowk (about 2 blocks away). The entrance to the Red Fort is about 5 blocks away. Jama Masjid was also within walking distance as well as countless other shops as well. Once we learned how close we were to Red Fort, autorickshaw drivers who weren't familiar with Tara palace had no problem taking us to Red Fort and then we would walk the short distance back to the hotel.Close restaurants within relative walking distance were Karim's, McDonald's and Moti Mahal (The last is recommended as it was a nice clean place that served delicious fare at reasonable prices).On our return to Delhi, we stayed one night at Tara Palace but our flight wasn't until 1am. We talked to reception and were allowed to stay in our room for half-price until 9pm. "
hotel tara palace ,"Old Delhi is a shock to the senses We stayed at the Hotel Tara Palace on the first night of our 3 week holiday touring India.Old Delhi was a real shock to the senses for me... perhaps I was a little naive. The noise is deafening, constant hooting, animals all over the place no pavements and a great deal of rubbish all around.It would be fair to say that my heart dropped when I saw that our hotel was down a dark alleyway .... what had I done!The hotel however was very clean. The staff were helpful and courtious, and our room was large.Due to a cancelled flight we had to alter our booking at short notice, they were very willing to assist, care for our bags and advise us on travel plans.As we stayed in January when it was quite cold in the evening they supplied a fan heater. We had tv will plenty of channels, a large bathroom, a comfortable bed and I would say it was very good value for money.The walls were quite thin, so if you are a light sleeper I would recommend ear plugs!Breakfast was nice, and we also had supper on one night which was excellent. No alcohol served here.I didn't enjoy wandering around in the evening and there weren't really any nice restaurants around (McDonalds around the corner!)There is free internet for guests in the lobby.I would recommend this for people of a budget, but if you are not I would prefer to stay in Connaught Place as it is cleaner, and quite nice to wander around in the evening.Total nights staying at the hotel 2. "
hotel tara palace ,"great value near red fort probably as good as you will find in the chaotic centre of old delhi .I&quot;ve been to india a few times so know what to expect and this hotel was certainly better than my hopes .Yes it is located in a run down area but this is truly the centre of old delhi . and the streets are buzzing with indian daily life All the facilities are clean,the rooms bright with adequate facilities the restaurant is fine the staff helpful. the price is a bargain for this standard of accom all in all a no brainer .I will recommend this to friends without hesitation "
hotel tara palace ,"Great value for money! This has to be the best &quot;value for money&quot; hotel in Delhi. The location is great for the Red Fort and in the midst of Old Delhi. Take advantage of the complimentary airport pickup - it's good to have a driver who knows how to find the hotel as it is down an alleyway. We stayed at the hotel on two occasions and both rooms were clean and functional. The complimentary breakfast was basic, but given the price that you pay for the room (which included breakfast) it was fine.We would definately recommend this hotel to travellers to Delhi.Don't be put off by the entrance to the alley way - there's a gem of a hotel at the end! "
hotel tara palace ,"nice place - location is tough This place was very nice... clean with good serivces, warm shower etc... the price is a bit high. The location is tough in general (old Delhi) but the hotel certainly stands out as an oasis. It's a bit tricky to find so I would try to arrange a pick-up at the train or bus station or airport. Pretty close to the subway and Red Fort... might want try to avoid walking around in the early morning though (before sunrise)... depends what you're looking for but you will certainly see the 'old delhi side' of India "
hotel tara palace ,"Basic stay at the Tara Well, we needed a place for a quick overnight after flying nearly 24 hours and then having a flight the next morning. The hotel was pretty average and the walls were pretty thin. The bed was relatively stiff but we were so tired after all that flying that it didn't really matter. For the price, it was not too bad. The alleyway was a little scary coming in late at night, but was much less so in the day light. The area where the hotel is located is a bit dirty, but you won't really escape that if you spend any time in Delhi! The breakfast that was included wasn't bad, either! "
hotel tara palace ,Noisy as hell Clean and an interesting location in the middle of a market but it is impossible to sleep.They have the tv blasting 24 hours a day downstairs at reception and you can hear it in the rooms.The other annoying thing is the lift buzzer.I went for breakfast on the first day and they had jugs of water. I said mineral water and pointed at the jug. The waiter said &quot;Yes&quot;. Then ten minutes later after I had drunk two glasses of water a bottle of mineral water turned up.Avoid unless desperate.They did arrange an airport pickup which was good. 
hotel tara palace ,"You could do worse The Hotel Tara Palace was a decent cheap hotel, right in the heart of old Delhi and very close to the Red Fort and Jama Masjid. This was the first place we stayed in India and the surrounding area was a great crash course in Indian mess and chaos.The airport transfer we booked through the hotel was slow (it took about 2 hours before we even left the airport, we have no idea what the guy was doing) and overpriced. Next time we'd definitely skip it and taxi/auto rickshaw. Once we arrived at the hotel the driver even had the nerve to ask for a tip!The room itself was clean and quite nice, although quite light and noisy at night.The staff at the desk were friendly enough but very pushy and reminded us of used car salesmen. Every time we talked to them we felt as though we were being hustled in some way.Breakfast was average. "
hotel tara palace ,"Best in Old Delhi I stayed here for a week in October, 2008. Pre-paid airport pickup was prompt and as promised. The hotel is wonderfully located, if Old Delhi is what you want. It sits at the end of a small alley that looks scary at first but once you get used to the ebb and flo of the area, you see that it is busy but safe. The hotel room was very clean. The included breakfasts were solid. The desk staff was excellent. Two negatives, both avoidable: you WILL get pressed for trips, etc. by hotel people. If you want to take them up on it, I'm sure they'll do a decent job. I wasn't interested, made that clear and they very quickly left me alone. Second, I had to leave a day early and the hotel refused to refund my last day's pre-paid payment. Suggestion: don't prepay, except the first night. All in a all a great very attractively priced clean and safe hotel in Old Delhi -- one of the few. "
hotel tara palace ,"Great hotel best choice in Delhi For our first night in Delhi we chose this hotel after reading reviews and comparing different sites-we were very happy with our choice, very good and clean room, very good price,great location in Old Delhi, nice and helpful staff-never tried to sell us anything which is much appreciated in India... lovely breakftast, internet We were so happy that we chose it again later on our journey, I do recomment to stay here- it is a pity that is not recommended on the guides-I had the Rough GuideOf course Old Delhi streets are a bit shocking if it is your first time in India but we loved it and preferred to stay there and visit around and get lost in the alleys and the bazaar "
hotel tara palace ,"Okay Hotel The staff at the hotel were very nice and willing to help us plan our trip and get us taxi's. The room was clean and quiet and the room service was decent. The air condtioner didn't work and the glass in our bathroom window was shattered, as well as some missing glass shards missing which made us nervous about mosquito's. As far as location goes, it is walking distance to the red fort and transportation is easy in Delhi. I would not stay here if I was not traveling with a man based on it's location in old delhi. We were told the area near coughnant place was a bit safer. Make sure you email and call your flight info to the hotel if you want to get the shuttle service. Looking back on our trip, it would have been worth it to pay more and get a nicer hotel to escape to after seeing Delhi. The place was pretty cheap, so I guess we got what we paid for. "
hotel tara palace ,"A little better than average My weeklong stay at the Tara Palace was just alright. It also could be that I just didn't like Delhi in general and that jaded me toward the Tara Palace, but there were several things I didn't like about the hotel. But let me start with what I did like:-Airport pickup was great. No problems here. A little more expensive than a prepaid, but you can't really complain about that.-Hotel was clean. Rooms were made every day and soap/shampoo was replaced most days.-A good location. Near the Red Fort and Chawni Chowk metro. Some don't like the location in the middle of the dirty old city, but I didn't really mind.-Free breakfast! It's a nice breakfast, too.What I didn't like:-They seriously don't know how to make a bed. Someone needs to teach them. The sheet only covered my midsection and the blanket covered my feet. It was weird.-I always got the feeling they were trying to sell me things. Packages and such. Every I was asked where I was going. You could chalk this up to friendliness, but it seemed to have ulterior motives.-The guy who works the desk at night is a jerk. Not helpful at all and almost misleading. The first night I was there he told me I owed 100 rupees for using the computer for one hour. No where in Delhi charges more than 50 rupees an hour for the internet and he was clearly going to pocket the money I gave him. I didn't give him anything and told him to bill it to my room. I talked to other travelers in the hotel and they had similar negative experiences with him, also.All in all, the stay was just ok. I liked a lot of things about the hotel but didn't like some other things. I think that puts it about neutral, right? "
hotel tara palace ,"good hotel but location so so Clean hotel, good service depending with who you're talking, but in a sketchy location. If it's your first stay in Delhi, you'll be surprised. Not too safe during the night if you wanna go out. "
hotel tara palace ,"Great place the other glowing reviews were accurate. Pros:Perfectly Clean, and they seem to clean your room everyday (a plus in India it seems)Great Location - 5 minute walk to Red Fort, subway station, McDonalds, and ATMsVery helpful front deskQuiet insideNice construction for the price (white marble floors, etc.)Good free breakfast included (proper breakfast, not muffins and juice boxes)Cons:Neighborhood is very, very dirty, and very, very poor. It's really a bit horrible your first time. Much of Delhi is that way though. Conclusion:Our favorite of 4 hotels we used in India, and ironically the cheapest. Aside from the disgusting neighborhood, everything about it is great. "
hotel tara palace ,"Clean hotel spotty service The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are lovely. It's located in a small alley in the back of Old Delhi which may be a bit overwhelmng for a first-time visitor, but I found it to be one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Delhi.The service was inconsistent, which was a real let-down. I waited an hour at the airport for the prepaid pickup and when nobody arrived set out on my own. 2 hours, one taxi and one rickshaw later I finally located the hotel. Note that their booking confirmation forms have no address or phone number on them so write them down separately!The hotel solicited information about my plans then recommended a travel agent who turned out to offer very poor value. The first day he sent a driver in a non A/C car that rattled all over Delhi. I'd asked for hotels like Tara Palace and although I was charged similar rates, got some substandard hotels in Agra and Jaipur and a replacement driver who insisted on taking me to commissioned &quot;crafts shops&quot; despite the owner's insistence that they wouldn't. If Tara Palace is going to quiz their guests about plans then send them to a recommended travel agent, they should make sure the agent is delivering what he promised and value for money. "
hotel tara palace ,"Good clean and friendly hotel in Delhi This hotel is new with spotlessly clean, spacious rooms and comfortable beds. The staff were exceptionally friendly, they bent over backwards to assist and the restaurant food was OK. Internet is available in rooms if you have a PC and the room and laundry service was good.There were insufficient blankets on the bed on arrival but more were secured from reception after a phone call. This seems to be common in India in that you are given one single top sheet and one single blanket for a queen sized bed. This happened several times in various places. The location was good and central as long as you didn’t mind going down an alley (probably better for groups or couples than solos). The Red Fort and metro only a short walk away.A very good hotel for the price and a great find in Delhi where many of the hotels are a disgrace, even if you pay much more.We would definitely stay there again. "
hotel tara palace ,"Service with a Smile I arrived at by myself at night., and as a female was a little apprehensive. I was a little put off at first as it is tucked away down a lane in a not so welcoming part of Delhi. But upon entering I was given excellent, friendly warm service. The rest of our party of 14 arrvived over the next day and all received the same treatment. The rooms were clean and neat. The restaurant served tasty food and nothing was too much trouble. The rooftop terrace provide excellent views over the Red Fort. Perhaps if you were travelling solo(female) or first time to India, it is not ideal,but for couples, or groups it is fantastic. Would recommend. Internet access in the rooms plus cable TV, prompt 24 hour room service. Nearby is busy Chandi Chowk which in day is colourful and you can buy fresh fruit at markets. Nearby is Haldirans -great clean Indian fast food plus fantastic sweets! And if you must there is also a Mcdonalds nearby "
hotel tara palace ,"Warm and friendly Tara Tara Palace was our first hotel in India and it was with some trepidation that we got off our coach in Old Delhi. The facade was not impressive - far from it; but the warmth began as soon as we walked in the door.The accommodation was clean and the staff could not have been more helpful. The small but friendly eating area was always open and it was a treat to wander in for our tea and toast early in the morning. Hot water was a bit dodgy at times, but staff were always willing to help us when we got into trouble.Drinks on the roof was also a treat. All in all, a really good quality three-star hotel. "
hotel tara palace ,"So-So Hotel If what you are looking for is a clean room, then you will get what you are looking for here. This can be a difficult thing to find in many hotels in Delhi. Unfortunately, it is in a really bad neighborhood. But then again, unless you want to stay in a really expensive hotel in Delhi, it is going to be in a bad neighborhood. The location is good for some of the sightseeing. It is right across from the Red Fort and very close to some of the other sights, but don't expect to be able to wander around past sundown. The key thing for us was that it was clean. If your taxi driver insists on calling ahead to &quot;confirm&quot; your reservations, it is a scam. He will pretend to call and then tell you your room is double booked and try to divert you to another hotel where he gets a hefty commission. Insist on going to the hotel. Your room is still available. This is a common scam "
hotel tara palace ,"Budget Hotel TaraPalace ""Nice Interior Helping staff great nearby Historical Hotel was clean, with an impressive lobby,although the room was smallish, but had all the facilities there.The historic places near the hotel like Red Fort, Raj Ghat, Gurudwara Sheesh Ganj and many other places of Old Delhi are at walking distance form the hotel.Hotel staff was very friendly and supportive but the thing which was most useful for me was the internet connection the my room as I am a techie ;-) so cant live without it.I would like to visit this hotel again soon. "
hotel tara palace ,"Don't go here on first night in India! This hotel was clean, however the experience of this hotel due to its location and the hotel staff was awful. This area of old delhi is massively crowded with men who stared with contemptuous disdain or who agressively hassled us for custom/tours you name it. If this is your first night in India after a long flight I'd recommend you stay in Connaught place or central Delhi. Certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel or area to a lone female - the amount of hassle and contempt you receive is not worth it and the area could well be dangerous at night. The hotel staff directed all comments to my (male) companion, even when I asked questions; the lobby was continually filled with around 10 men who sat about and gawked at my chest. Been to India several times before with no problems, was dressed conservatively, never had this sort of intimidation in a hotel. The hotel manager woke us up with a phone call at 7am on our first (and last) morning there demanding to know our plans for the day, then when we went out, followed us down the street agressively hawking various tours/deals. Later he told me he had to photograph me and got out a computer camera - when I asked why he became very agressive and threatening, and only backed down when my partner intervened. No other hotel during our stay in India requsted a photo of either of us. When we ordered room service there were four visits to our room - one to deliver the food, one to take the plates away, one to get the money and another for the change and to get a tip. Annoying.This hotel would probably be bearable after a few weeks acclimatising and developing a thick skin, but if you're going for a couple of weeks holiday I'd advise you to pick somewhere out of old delhi, and certainly not tara palace.

hotel vikram ,Live upto the expectations I stayed there in Jan'08 for a about 3 days after my marriage and before my Honeymoon in Goa. The stay was very comfortable and most amazing part was where Hotel allowed my uncle to dress entire room with flowers (something which management was little reluctant earlier).Room was clean and room service prompt. The size of room was quite good and bathroom was very clean and spacious too.

hotel vikram ,"Hotel Vikram Hotel Vikram offers all the facilites you want. They are though a ona littl eexpensive side.I guess, for the tariff that they charge, you could easily tak eosme other luxurious hotel. Theer isnt anythign special . Teh locations doe not have any major scenic locale, no views etc..The place aslo is hoem to a lot of unwanted people (read :Prositutes etc) .You might run into some drunk men also.The good thing is the breakfast that they give. its a buffet &amp; really lavish . N really yummy! "
hotel vikram ,"good value clean hotel but... I had stayed there for one night and had some good sleep. It costs me around USD100, include breakfast, so quite good value. Very clean but it has no air con in the washroom and it is very hot this time round (36C. The control over the air con in the room is not function but luckily it has a very pleasant ceiling fan. Happy with its size and cleaniness.However very unprofessional receptionist with dirty hands and uniform, no smile and it seems bothering her when checking in. Usually they will let you get out of the lift first and they will follow when showing you to the room but this receptionist pushed me a bit and she get out first, this is rude! Dont eat western food like carbonara as it never looks like one although it is a simple crusine, asian food looks and taste better. Be careful, they charge you 200 rupees for an hour internet usae which I think is outragoues. "
hotel vikram ,"Felt myself like a Princess! :) Hello! I traveled to India with my fiancé in April, 2009. To say I liked it is to say nothing! May be the part of my excitement was the fact that I finally made it to the country of my dreams. The Vikram Hotel is in 10 min drive to the Lotus Temple. What I really liked is that there was a Travel Agent working at the hotel who helped us to arrange our trip to Agra and all the sightseeing tours (just Hotel taxi driver, no English speaking guide) around Delhi. He also booked our airline tickets to Kochi, Kerala. (Just for your information, know that there are two airports in Delhi – for Domestic flights and for international flights. These two are located in 15 min drive apart from each other). Hotel personnel was polite and friendly, rooms were surprisingly clean. Was impressed with Restaurant food and service. Kingfisher beer is the best! ? Of course there are many other hotels in Delhi you can choose from. But for me Vikram was the best place during our stay in Delhi. No doubt, I will choose it again if we will ever travel to Delhi again. "
hotel vikram ,A hotel in Delhi A decent and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi. Value for the money and the hotel is kept clean and maintained well. The staff are very cooperative and helpful. Very close to many business establishments and would suggest for people who do not want to spend more money on accommodation and want a good quality and comfortable stay in Delhi 
hotel vikram ,"Good facility Had travelled to Delhi with a group of about 30 people on a business trip and was in charge of all the logistics arrangements. Hotel Vikram was recommended by the travel agent and visited it before confirming the booking. The rooms are very clean, freshly done up and comfortable. Specifically choose a carpeted room especially in winters as the rates are the sameStayed there for 3 days with the entire group and didnt face a single complaint from the guests. The food at the in-house restaurant is good and so is the room service. Just that the swimming pool was under maintainance during our stay.Location is very accessible and at walkable distance from the popular Lajpat Nagar market.All in all a good choice and fair value for money. "
hotel vikram ,"Best Location in Delhi My friend told me about this hotel, it is value for money in everyway ie food,alchol,room etc so overall you dont end up spending much in the hotel.Quality of food is also vey good infact I had the best Indian food here.Staff is very helpful and best part is location its right next to all the bars, shopping and also work places....... "
hotel vikram ,"Average property.. The staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. Plenty of hot running water (which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor), but bed mattresses were old &amp; lumpy. The bathroom vent was woefully covered with plastic from the outside. The restaurant was decorated well which made it pleasing to the eye. The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotel’s stronger points. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again "
hotel vikram ,"Budget hotel for 2 nights This is one of those hotels with the archetypal Indian doorman, complete with giant moustache and turban. A nice touch when you first arrive but that novelty wears off. Metal detectors were installed at the entrance, but don’t work. This set the standard for what was to come. The room was adequate though the immovable shower head was annoyingly weak, and being 6ft tall, I had to bend me knees in order to get under it. Being in the city, I can accept it being noisy in the night, but with the bathroom vent woefully covered with plastic from the outside, and pigeons coming and going, it wasn’t pleasant. The bed was saggy and the sheets had seen better days. The restaurant was decorated well which made it pleasing to the eye. The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotel’s stronger points, with a fair selection at reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet was, in contrast, sparse and so could have done with more continental choices like pastries.There is no gym and the outdoor pool was closed in the winter season. For the 2 night stay we had, it was average, but I would be reluctant to stay there again, especially if it was any longer than 2 nights. "
hotel vikram ,"Brown shower water honking horns The hotel is located near the hospital I was intending to visit, near Nehru Place. The hotel has a small restaurant, there are taxis available, and the hotel itself is no beter or worse than your average US economy hotel. They have a little garden out front, and the restaurant is clean. I did not like the noise of the cars honking all night long (the hotel is near a major street). The hotel itself is quiet, but apparently doesn't have double hung windows or soundproofing. There was a jalousie window in the bathroom that opened directly out onto the street which also made the bathroom hot and noisy compared to the room. The water ran brown in the bathroom the last day and the water temperature was tempramental during my visit. I used the dry cleaning service and they *washed* my wool business dress, ruining it. I would stay this is a fine hotel for a budget tourist trip, but I wouldn't stay here on business. If you stay here, bring ear plugs. "
hotel vikram ,"2 stars at best do not recommend My Background: I am a frequent international business traveller (US, Europe, China &amp; India) and when on personal vacation, an adventure traveller (Europe, South America, Africa, APAC).Hotel Vikram Review:I would stay here if,- you are on a tight budget, looking for a below average hotel to stay- you are a local Indian business man, with non-western expectationsI wouldn't stay here if,- personal vacation in Delhi- business travel with western hotel expectations- with familyIn a nut shell, this hotel is 2 stars at best. Its safe, has AC (if it doesn't fail), clean bathroom and a comfortable bed. Its a very basic hotel. I recently travelled to Delhi for a trade show and stayed here because my local sales manager had booked us here. I had reserved a Luxury room, which is loosely defined. When I checked in, I asked for a non-smoking room, and was led to a room with a single bed (i.e. prison size bed). Apparently, all their non-smoking rooms have single beds - which is tucked away beside a wall that was fairly stained. I had immediately asked for another room with a double or queen size bed, but was told all rooms with larger beds are &quot;smoking&quot;. Since I was staying here for almost 5 nights, I wanted a decent size bed to sleep in so I braved the smoking room. It turned out to be ok, with no distinct smoking smell. The carpets in the room are quite old and worn, and not overly clean. The bed is comfortable, but the clean staff for some reason always wrap the comforter (the covering that never gets changed!) around the pillows, which makes the pillows not very appealing to sleep on. The sheets are well worn, and have stains that cannot be washed out. The rooms do not have ironing boards or an iron, so you have to dial room service to get one every morning - which usually takes 30-45 minutes to arrive (i think they must only have one and its shared among all the guests every morning!!). When it does arrive, the iron is from the 60's, and is basically a piece of metal with a handle and an electric cord. It does not steam, etc. like a modern iron. The ironing board is heavily yellow stained (like someone urinated on it). The bathroom is quite small but usable. My room in particular did not have running cold water in the sink. The shower has good water pressure. Half way through my stay, the motor of my room's AC died in the middle of the night, so I had to change room again (3 times in total within 5 days). Every room has wireless Internet, but the connection is quite slow. A week's worth of Internet is 1500 Rs, but if you put it from the front desk (instead of online), its a bit cheaper. The staff is generally friendly. The restaurant downstairs is not bad, although the breakfast is quite basic. By default, they serve you instant coffee, so you need to ask for &quot;black espresso&quot;, in which case they brew it from a machine. The Indian food in the restaurant is pretty good, as I ate there a few evenings after long days. Room service is efficient and quick. The hotel has a Tourist desk that can arrange tours to Taj Mahal. It'll cost you 4200 Rs to hire a private car and driver. A guide will cost another 500 Rs (which you paid to the guide directly). The drive to Agra/Taj Mahal is about 3-4 hours, so leave early (6am). Would I go back again? No. However, my expectations might be different than others, so if you are looking for a 2-star quality hotel, than Hotel Vikram is fine. But if you are a westerner travelling on company business, I would recommend you stick to a western chain hotel. The location of hotel is irrelevant as you have to take a cab everywhere anyway in Delhi generally. The noise level outside the hotel is pretty loud - I can always hear frequent car honks and dogs barking in my room, so if you are a light sleeper, you might have trouble sleeping.I hope this helps the next person make their choice. I paid 8500 Rs for my room. Hotels in Delhi are generally expensive due to lack of rooms and high demand. Bare in mind that price of a hotel room does not necessary reflect its quality like it normally does in North America or Europe. "
hotel vikram ,"Reasonable value - we would go again My family (2 Adults and 2 Children) stayed at the Vikram at the end of October 2007 for 10 days. Having previously been in India in 2002 and at the time, for what was then called the Marriott Hotel (its name has changed now- can't remember what) we paid £60 room only, we were now alarmed to find that an average room in a 5* hotel was £220+ per night. We therefore decided to go for a cheaper option, bearing in mind we could run into problems with this decision!!!However, we were pleased to find that the Vikram is a clean and friendly hotel. It is about a 20 minute taxi ride from the centre of Delhi (depending on traffic conditions). We negotiated Rs 10,000 per night for a luxury room including 2 extra beds and breakfast. In all honesty we have to say it equalled the 5* hotel we previously stayed in if you are a tourist. (In fact the luxury room was larger than the room we stayed at in the Marriott )If you are looking for a clean hotel in Delhi at a reasonable cost, then the Vikram is fine. In the UK it easily exceeds Travelodge, Premier Lodge etc. However - for room service the alcohol was expensive - especially wine!!!The swimming pool was dry in October and we are not sure when it will be refilled. If you are looking for a reasonable price, then we would have no hesitation in recommending the Vikram. Remember 4* in the UK isn't necessarily 4* in India - it is perfectly adequate. "
hotel vikram ,Could do a lot worse We spend a bit of time in Delhi on business and have stayed in a number of hotels. Whilst I agree that there are some problems with the hotel (yes the staff aren't very friendly) it feels much more homely than all others in the City. The snacks in the bar are terrific (try the chili chicken) and it's a great place for a quiet beer after a full on day in the hustle and bustle that is Delhi. There are some interesting walks around the hotel into what I presume to be fairly up market areas with their own common gardens and the market is mightily impressive (if you're into shopping). 
hotel vikram ,"Expensive We stayed in a superior room between 02 March and 07 March 2007. The room was spacious and stylishly furnished. Room service food was good and was also reasonably priced. The only problem though was that the front-desk staff was very unfriendly and very unhelpful. In addition, the location is not ideal. It is about a 30min drive by tuk-tuk to Connaught Place and the main shopping and tourist areas. Overall the hotel was ok, but we felt that it was not value for money and would probably not stay at this hotel in the future. "
hotel vikram ,"Value for Money I had a comfortable stay at the Vikram, Delhi. Hotel is situated in Lajpat Nagar, just off the Ring Road which is the main arterial road of Delhi, making it easier to travel around. Although the immediate surroundings doesn't have much to offer.The lobby is bit on the smaller side but adequate seating is available for it's size. Check-in was fast but not very friendly.Room was adequate in size for a hotel in this class. Bed was comfortable and TV had most of the cable channels. Bathroom was good. The window didn't offer much of a view.Breakfast was good and plentiful. Breakfast area was pretty neat and it also had a large Plasma display. Service was okay.Overall, a good experience though the hotel is more of 3 star class rather than 4 star as it claims to be. "
hotel vikram ,"great for this price range In Delhi you can either spend $200 plus for a luxury hotel, or take a risk at the lower ranges and hope for the best. We wanted the Ambassador which is very centrally located but they were booked, so we tried Hotel Alka- bad choice- don't stay there!!In the morning we packed our bags and went searching for something better and ended up at Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar. It's about 20 min or so from Connaught, etc, but close to the Lotus Temple and other sites, and Greater Kailash which has great shopping and restaurants, as well as the Lajpat Nagar market which is very good, much better prices then downtown.The hotel has recently been refurbished so the carpets and rooms are new and very nice, and the bathroom was small but nicely done, even better than the Taj Mahal bathrooms. The staff was very kind and helpful and we were thrilled to find it after our terrible experience at Alka.Not good for wondering around outside, but good for a safe haven after an intense day in the city. It's clean, nice, and friendly, and not too far from the airport (always depending on traffic) "
hotel vikram ,"So so hotel My wife and I stayed at the Vikram hotel twice during April 2006. It is described as a 4 star hotel but is no better than a very average 3 star hotel. The rooms were O.K. (television, air conditioning etc) but hot water was temperamental and twice I had to take a cold shower. Buffet breakfast was rather bland and the options limited. Hotel bar was small and pokey but the drinks and snacks were well priced. Check in was efficient but not very friendly. On the plus side the hotel was clean and safe and was conveniently located close to the Locus Temple, Qutb Minar and the South Extension Markets. Overall not a bad place to stay as long as you are not paying 4 star rates "
hotel vikram ,"OK Room was clean and comfortable enough, but bathroom window had no screen and was covered by some sort of tarp from the outside! Neighborhood is not nice, not a place to be walking around. Service was adequate. Even though proximity to major tourist sites is good on the map, it took a long time to get to anything. "
hotel vikram ,"Go somewhere else. Although rated as 4-star in India, this was definitely not a 4-star hotel. The staff was quick with check-in, but the floor lobbies &amp; rooms had old carpet, which smelled stale and bad. Plenty of hot running water (which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor), but bed mattresses were old &amp; lumpy. Wouldn't recommend or stay here again. "
hotel vikram ,"Pristine refuge in the heart of Delhi We recently spent three nights at the Hotel Vikram and had a wonderful time. Rooms were spotless and comfortable, an ideal refuge after a day of sightseeing -- furnishings were new and tasteful, shower and bathroom extraordinarily clean, and traffic noise minimal. Service was impeccable, from the front desk to the travel desk and hotel drivers to the very efficient room service. Breakfast was also quite good, with a good selection of continental and Indian specialities. Convenient location too. Great value, excellent hotel! "

hotel welcome palace ,Pathetic Hotel Hotel WELCOME PALACE IS A PATHETIC HOTEL..mR miglani owner of this hotel is a cheat..All commitments are false.Beware of this hotel.they are fraud 
hotel welcome palace ,"The WRONG hotel welcome palace! My buddy and I were working in Indonesia, and decided to take a weekend trip to see the Taj. He began researching places to stay, and came upon one online that looked great (hotelwelcomepalace.net). When he booked it, he accidentally went to hotelwelcomepalace.com, and we ended up here.When we arrived, weary from our flight and ordeal with customs around 3 am. We knew to expect to bargue for everything, but nothing would prepare us for this place. This place was very &quot;it's ok...&quot; about everything. For instance, we asked for a couple sealed bottles of water, and we got refilled bottles. &quot;It's OK...&quot; yeah, no can we please get some SEALED bottles... &quot;grumble....&quot;Being from the west, we were suspicious of them wanting to hold our passports, and I think they decided to get back at us for that. So they showed us to our room. Dirty walls, floors, bathroom was ok, but we were just like, well it's India, we will survive, just staying one night then off to Agra....We had to bargue to get ourselves an extra matress for the floor (my bud had asked for a room w/ two beds, we got a single queen haha). Finally, after we were situated and had just fallen asleep, they come banging on the door to move us to a different room. 3 or 4 floors up. In the middle of the night! TO AN EVEN DIRTIER NASTIER SMALLER ROOM!!!!! My friend and I looked at each other as soon as they left the room, and decided to not even try with this place. We just walked downstairs, told them to call us a cab and checked out of this worthless place.We ended up just splurging and staying at the Intercontinental! Much more expensive, but after this ordeal, the cleanliness and courtesy and amenities were worth the high price.Please, whatever you do, doublecheck your web address before you book! "
hotel welcome palace ,A distaster This hotel is really very bad. I strongly reccomend to avoid it. 
hotel welcome palace ,"Liked it Was there in late evening. Our Id was asked at the hotel and then transfered to room after check in which was express and took 5min only.By the time welcome drink was served. After check in 2 bottles of mineral water was served with fruit basket to our room. We were hungry when we checked in the hotel so ordered the dinner which was served in 15min, &amp; we really enjoyed the food. Next day on asking hotel for sightseeing hotel arranged it for 3 days. Delhi Sight Seeing/ Agra same day tour &amp; shimla 2 days. We hired the cab from hotel at 7 Rs. km which was new santro. Hotel had free internet for there all guests staying.Hotel have just opened there Resturant which was upto 12 mindnite &amp; room service 24 hrs.Hotel had electric back up too. Staff was very very friendly &amp; obiedient. Over all liked it very much. "
hotel welcome palace ,"Avoid at all costs!! Please, please PLEASE do not stay at this hotel!! If you already made reservations, cancel them!!!I stayed here for two nights, but looking back I cannot believe I stayed there that long.The first room we were in was very dirty, had holes in the wall, and no windows! After inspecting the room further we found rat droppings on the nightstand and on the floor. We figured, whatever we are in india you just deal with it, but later on when the rat actually appeared from the wall we couldn't handle it anymore. We asked to be switched to a different room, after management made us feel stupid for asking such a ridiculous request. Our next room was nicer, but the bathroom had only a trickle of running water and the window overlooked a very noisy and highly used alleyway. The first night we were there, a musical performance went on all night outside of our window. We would have moved the next night to a different hotel but seeing as we got 2 hours of sleep the night before and had spent ALL day traveling to and from the Taj, we really just wanted to get to bed.I never took my socks off the whole time because the floors were so gross... in fact i threw them out before coming home. The management also changed our rates upon checking out. We had a pre booked rate from the manager of the hotel but when we checked out they added a bunch of taxes that we were never told of, even though our pre booked rate supposedly included all taxes.Please, do not stay here. There are plenty of other hotels in the area, and make sure to ask to see the room before you stay there!!! "
hotel welcome palace ,"Avoid this place! I join the opinion of the others - it was a horrible experience. The rooms were horrible. Staff was sooo rude! They also had organised airport transportation for us even though we didn't even talk abt that with them and then afterwards tried to charge us for that! The rooms were horrible soo dirty and disgusting, + only cold water etc. I also agree one who wrote that I don't think the rooms had ever been cleaned.. After one night in the morning one of the staff members is knocking our door and says that we need to change our room that it's booked to some other people. Excuse me?? Then this guy tells that the room that we had booked wasn't available when we arrived so we had a got better one..Yeah right! A better one can this get any worse even.. In the end we just left from the hotel and moved to another one. I do think that the best area to stay is Paharganj - there you can find much selection. It might be a messy area but it's located also perfectly. Easy access to metro. "
hotel welcome palace ,"Disliked the attitude of the employees the most We have just returned from a trip to new delhi. We stayed in this hotel for most of the time and had the worst experience there! When we first checked in, we asked for the exact pricing of the rooms and cabs etc... so that we don't get conned later on. We then arranged for a cab to take us to the train station the next day and a wake up call at 4:30 am. The next day, we wake up at 4:45 because there was no wake up call! When we finish pack up our things and go downstairs at the reception, we find that no taxi has been arranged! When we ask the manager, he tells us nothing has been written in the books! He then arranges a taxi for us and bills us Rs 750 for it instead of the Rs 500 that he told us before and says that he is giving the 'big' cab!When we returned from our trip from kanpur, we waited at the platform 12 of the train station for a person with a board with our names( this also was arranged earlier with the hotel) After waiting for 15 minutes and seeing that no one is coming, we decided to arrange for the cab ourselves and return to the hotel. Now on the day that we are returning ( i.e. checking out) the bill contains 1 taxi for the day at the train station together with parking costs etc... when we were not even provided this service from them! Then, for the cab to go to the airport he charges more than he agreed upon beforehand.Then, another thing i did not like at all in this hotel is the fact that the waiters keeps pestering us for giving them tips. When we first checked in, being all guys, we carried our luggage to our rooms ourselves, however, the waiters would just come to our rooms with towels, and i don't know for what reasons and stay there for long time waiting for their tips! One of them even asked me directly if we are going to give them something before going! That shocked me the most! A tip is given if you think that the service was good and it shows that we liked it, but these guys make it seem as if that the tip is compulsory whatever the type of service you get!Finally, i would not recommend anyone to go and stay in this hotel unless you like to be ripped off and conned! This place has its location as its only good point, the attitude of the people over there are just disgusting! The rooms are very badly maintained with no hot showers and badly done electrical installation! "
hotel welcome palace ,"The worst you could get Don't be fooled by the name of the Hotel... You would neither be welcomed properly... nor it is a Palace whatsoever... In fact, it's the total opposite...I don't know if the owner ever says anything true in his words... Everything you ask is &quot;OK&quot; but without any concrete actions... No wake up calls that has been confirmed on the eve by him...Cabs... lol, I could write a book about this part... Well, in brief... Cabs scheduled on the eve are nowhere to be found at the said time! Tadaaaaaa!!! The owner didn't write it in whatever book! And the price... once he knows you got no other choice than taking the cab he would propose because of time constraint, the price keeps on rising...The rooms are among the worsts I've ever seen... I've been to many hotels with the same budget or even less... but this one is one of a kind... The electric wiring seems so dangerous, just mere connections between wires... Beware, you could be electrified! The hot showers were never hot... even if you asked them to put the roof boiler on... I wonder if the bedsheets, glasses, bathroom are ever really cleaned...Well the only good thing in choosing this hotel is that it is near the Metro and the shopping area of Karol Bagh...But if I were you, and want value for money, I would avoid it at all costs!!!P.S. Beware of the lift also! It can close on your limbs!!! Better you climb up the stairs to your floor... You've been warned... ;) "
hotel welcome palace ,"Not satisfied with management At first, the person at the desk appeared to be gentle. That was the first impression I personally had. Indeed the hotel was not bad but not very good neither.There is one pc connected to the internet which is an advantage. But unfortunately, it was not working one day..so couldn't really send some important emails.The rooms were ok for 2 persons. However, having a hot shower is a problem. It was pure luck to sometimes have hot water and sometimes not.The advantage of the hotel is that it is really near the metro stationand a street where we made a lot of shopping.Restaurants are very near too. But it can get really noisy at night.However, the service at reception was not really good and had a bad experience with them. No promised wakeup call, no cab in the morning and no cab at the train station. However, we were charged heavily for those..which unfortunately did somehow exceeded our budget. "
hotel welcome palace ,"Disliked the crooked attitude of the management We stayed in Hotel Welcome palace on the 25th-26th October 2007 and then, from 29th October till 1st November 2007.We asked the owner to give us a wake up call at 430 on the 26th and arrange for a cab @500. We had an early flight to catch. We also asked for a cab to pick us up from the train station on the 29th. TheHotel manager noted our requests. I asked him about the price for thecab, and it was Rs 500. The next morning, no wake up call, no cab waiting for us. There was a different person at the frontdesk and he said that the cab would cost Rs 750. When I protested, he said that ishould discuss with the other guy when am back. On the 29th, there was no cab waiting for us at the train station. We take a cab on our own, since none of the requests we had made earlier were not satisfied. When we arrive at the hotel, the manager says the driver is waiting for us at station.When I asked him for fare for a sight seeing trip, there was the basic Rs 2800 + additional fares for driver, which was not defined.On checking out, the bills were NOT what we had agreed on - the firstcab was 750 instead of the 500 he had promised. He claims that he gave us a big cab. He was charging for the cab that was never there plus he was charging Rs 850 for dropping us to the airport (compared to the 550 he had said earlier).On top of that, there was NO hot water for taking shower, when asked,front desk would say it would be activated in 10 mins - but alas, only vain promises. The bed sheets were not clean - looked like someone had been sleeping in those before. We were 2 in a room, but they consistently provided only one towel daily.You may stay at the hotel, but get all expected costs in writing fromthe beginning. Do NOT go by the manager's words, as he will findsome good excuse to charge you more - unless you have a lot of money to spare and do not really care about being cheated upon. "
hotel welcome palace ,"OK room but sneaky Management Recently we stayed at Hotel Welcome Palace at Gurudwara road. Few observations that others may find useful. Hotel is located near Karol Bagh shopping area. Some good food joints are near by. Considerable traffic outside, so it can get noisy in the room.1. Stayed at the Family suite, their most expensive offering. It's a nice, large room with two double beds, sitting area, TV with many channels, fridge, and attached bathroom. Room decor was good. Both AC units worked well. 2. Even though the room has a refrigerator, it works only when you deposit your room key in a key-holder. Once you remove the key from its holder to leave the room, electricity is automatically cut off. A warning in case you plan to keep perishables in the refrigerator.3. Bathroom is not well maintained. Some fixtures are missing. Towels are old and worn out. Hot water is available, but you have to call. 4. Hotel breakfast is terrible. We ordered the very basic: eggs, toast, butter, jam etc. They don't have a cafeteria; so they brought the food to our room. Presentation was poor. You are better off eating in nearby restaurants.5. I could not make local phone calls from the room. I called the front desk couple of times, but they couldn't fix it. For some reason, the outgoing calls are disabled at the front desk.6. Instead of providing honest and transparent service, the management seems keen to wring every rupee from their customers. I found this so irritating that next time I will take my business elsewhere. Some examples:---- We agreed for an amount so the hotel could arrange a vehicle to pick us up from the International airport. I knew the amount was excessive, but I agreed since we were reaching at night. The vehicle was in poor condition (busted wind shield, seat covers / interior in poor condition, non-existent shock absorbers). When checking out, I discovered that they had added parking fee, airport entry fee, night duty fee etc to the charge. These additional charges were removed when I protested. ---- The hotel website advertises complimentary breakfast. We ordered it on the first day. Found it terrible. In any case, the waiter asked me to sign off on a bill. As I suspected, it showed up in my hotel bill on the final day. I had to talk to their 'Director' to get the charges removed. He claimed ignorance when I asked why they charge for the complimentary breakfast. My guess is that they will charge and hope the customer pays. They will roll it back if you complain.---- On our first day, I had asked the hotel to arrange a AC car to take us around Delhi. Even though they charge a pretty good amount, they arrange lousy cars. On a hot / humid day, the AC barely worked. Car broke down several times during the day. It leaked coolant. When I asked the car driver to take us to the Humayun tomb, his response was that there wasn't much to see. My guess is that this hotel tries to arrange low quality cars so they can pay out less and make as much profit as possible. When I complained about quality of their cars, 'Director' apologized and tried to make amends by reducing the rental charge. Overall, our room was ok; but the management is sneaky. They seem unaware that in the age of Internet, they can gain / lose customers with a few mouse clicks. You are probably better off taking your business somewhere else. "
hotel welcome palace ,"I think you have all been rating the wrong hotel My fiance and I read these reviews, and thought, WOW, such amazing reviews, and so high in the Delhi hotels ranking, we cant go wrong for the price!!!!!But we did! For one thing, there are 2 Welcome palace hotels in Delhi, and the one in THIS review is the one we stayed in.We booked 3 nights in a double room with ensuit, for 800 rupees a night online. We turned up and were given a shoe box, with no AC, no towels, and no loo roll. (Apparently these 3 rooms are the ones advertised on the hostel and hotel websites for 800, but are actually used for staf to stay in) We were then expected to tip 3 bell boys who all jamp at the chance to grab our 2 rucksacks, to take up 1 flight of stairs to the room. Which we had to do, as they just hung around and waited for their tip.Around 5 mins later, another bell boy appeared knocking at the door bringing toilet roll, expecting a tip (i didnt know it was a luxury to expect loo roll?) We then decided for 800 rupees we should be in a better hotel with AC, but were tierd, so we upgraded. We were then shown every room in the property, ranging from our room being the worst, to 5 bed 'delux' rooms. we upgraded to AC, costing 1250 a night, and once again, we were expected to tip 2 bell boys for taking our rucksacks accross the landing. Later on in the evening, we had another knock from the same bell boy, bringing us a towel, and again, would not leave the room, and folded the towel twice waiting for a tip. This then continued for the rest of the stay, we would arrive back after a hot sweaty day of sightseeing, our room would not have been serviced, and after jumping in the shower, up to 4 knocks at the door till 9.30pm with porters bring various things, loo roll, soap, another towel??Its a pity, you get free internet, and the metro is close, and this whole area is much more peaceful than in town, with nice places to eat and shop, and to be fair, a little cheaper and we would have been happy, but they really need to sort out those porters, they made us feel terrible, sad eyed and dirty,. hanging around.We have now moved to another hotel.Stay here by all means, as the area has everything you need, but I would nip the bell boy issue in the bud before you even close your hotel room door! "
hotel welcome palace ,"Best Stay we had! I stayed at Welcome Palace for three nights in May with my Wife and eighteen year old daughter. The staff was very friendlier,polite &amp; attentive. We were on the First floor say the Executive Floor of the Hotel. Unlike some hotels there was not a hint of stuffiness or formality there. My daughter was very happy to be there &amp; felt as valued as my wife and I. Food was of our high standard, service without fault. The rooms are extremely comfortable, with great views. Best Part was it was near to all Shopping Areas &amp; Metro. Added to all the above a good location then I cannot think of a better place to stay in New Delhi. "
hotel welcome palace ,"Just Fine I stayed at the hotel at the beginning and end of my trip to India. After booking the hotel, I inquired as to whether or not they could arrange a full itinerary, which they did. I got all hotels (I specified), an air conditioned car and driver for 6 days, airport transfers and breakfasts for about $450 which was quite a bargain. They did a good job in setting it all up.The hotel is basic and as a one time Peace Corps volunteer, I found it met all my needs. The plumbing worked, as did the a/c. The bed was comfortable and there was cable tv. The staff was helpful and friendly and, while there was no restaurant, there was room service and breakfast was delivered to the room (included).The main drawback was the location which was not familiar to many rickshaw or taxi drivers, but I discovered that this lack of knowledge was true for all but the most famous places. The area was chaotic and noisy but the room was fairly quiet. One can walk to Conaught Place in about half an hour and the rail station is very near. At a daily rate of about $25, it was a good choice "
hotel welcome palace ,"Good travel centre shame about the rat We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2007. Generally the reception area was OK and the staff reasonably helpful. However, the sheets on the bed had already been slept in and there were some fairly unsavoury bugs in the bathroom. Breakfast was OK but took ages to come and you have to eat it in the lobby (which is where I saw the rat). However, the travel desk was excellent and arranged a car for the whole day to take us round to see the town. Unfortunately my friends had a bad experience in a taxi that was arranged by the travel desk but I guess they couldn't help that.Overall I would say that this hotel is acceptable if you are on a budget but I think I would try my luck somewhere else next time.

hotel welcome palace ,"Amazing Staff make this hotel excellent! We just returned from a fabulous three weeks touring beautiful India where we spent a total of 5 nights at the Welcome Palace Hotel, divided into two different segments. The Welcome Palace staff made us feel like family each time we arrived, arranged for our transportation with flawless efficency, made sure we found the best restaurants and even took us shopping to their secret favorite shops. (And these wern't the tourist trap places) Their insight and friendly manner was so valuable. The hotel itself is clean and spacious.They provided ample hot water (once we figured out how to turn it on), bottled water to drink and the room service was very good. The shinning star here is the staff.....all wonderful, friendly and helpful. I'd recommend the Hotel Welcome Palace to anyone looking for an affordable, clean and friendly hotel to make your stay in India a five star experience. "
hotel westend inn ,Comfortable stay if u wanna live in delhi close to the airport and closer to gurgaon then it is a good place to stay.....comfortable rooms. 
hotel westend inn ,"bad worst hiThis hotel is quite close to airport but hotel is really bad, customer service is bad and they have no proper manner, not up to the standard not a 4 star hotel. hotel rooms are very bad. ho heater no proper AC. bathroom is really bad, very very small and dirty. they didn't bother to clean it. couldnot even open the window as the passer by can see inside. it ruined our honeymoon trip as we didn't expect delhi 4 star hotel to be like this not worth even star. food was bad. people in the hotel were bad and not friendly. did not fulfill our requirments even after asking them n number of times. this was the only hotel horrible in our honeymoon as rest of the hotel we booked turned out to be excellent. "
hotel westend inn ,"Try to find another hotel We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights waiting for transfer to Cochin and by our travelagents mistake 2 nights more on the way back to Sweden. It was very run down, dirty bathrooms and with a sad looking staff working there. The descrition on the hotels website is far away from the true experience, be prepaired to be unable to sleep the nights you stay here. The hotel are built like a echo chamber, every little noise from the rooms or the reception (phones, staff make dishes/cleaning middle of the nigth) go straight into your room. There was bad smell in our rooms, no windows and very dark inside. Actually we felt ill from staying here, and felt better as soon as we had a possibilty to leave the hotel. As we staid during monsoon season we where worried that the roof should fall down, as huge amounts of water was pouring straight through the roof covering the eco chamber outside the rooms. So our advice: try to find another hotel in Delhi, the only favourible thing to say is that the hotel are very close to the airport, wich make it possible to make sure to be able to cach your departure even if the monsoon have hit Delhi badly (as it had upon our leaving). "
hotel westend inn ,"A basic hotel Delhi has gone haywire with hotel pricing, so what you could get for a small budget even a year ago can not be found today. The Westend Inn is a very basic hotel. It's generally clean, but make sure you get a renovated room on the side across from the pool. Some fixtures (like the soap dish in the bathroom) are broken, but the bed is comfortable, sheets are clean, the phone works, there's a tv, etc. Westerners should keep in mind that this is India, what you might get in the US is not going to be the case here-no bathtubs for example. The hotel staff speaks limited english (be prepared for that in in India in general) so if you want something complex, the only answer you'll get is yes, but you won't really get what you want. The wifi is a joke-it didn't work for the majority of the time we there, but then again this is an India issue in general. The rooms on the second floor have better wifi reception. The business center is not a business center and again internet only sometimes work. The westend inn is not as horrific as some other reviews make it out to be, but don't expect a 5 star experience, don't expect a US 3 star experience either for that matter either. And regarding mosquitos, you're in India, they are going to exist and if it's rained recently, they are going to be out in force. Don't open your windows and ask for the repellent plug in you see advertised all over India.The food is pretty decent here and cheap. Room service is not so great-food was terrible, but the buffet at the restaurant was good as were several of the other items we ordered off the menu. All in all, a decent experience. "
hotel westend inn ,"Stay Away! Very bad experience. Stay away. Hotel employees kept asking for tips and wouldn't leave the room until i've paid them. More specifically, I called the hotel desk to arrange a taxi to the airport because i thought a hotel arranged taxi would be more trustworthy. When i got to the airport, the Taxi driver asked for 300 Rs. I knew it should cost less than 150Rs to the domestic airport because i came from there the night before. I gave him 200 Rs. The next thing i heard is that the hotel charged an additional 300 Rs on my roommate 's bill when he checked out for this taxi service. "
hotel westend inn ,Favourable I have recently returned from Delhi where I visited along with some 40 others as part of a cricket tour.Before leaving we were all alarmed at the reports on TripAdvisor.However after our stay of some 10 days the reports were generally unfair.Our party found the Hotel clean and well maintained (some building work is in porgress to part of the building) and the staff to be very courteous and helpful.The reports about airport noise are clearly wrong.The only downside is the location which is isolated from other facilities and involves an adventure in the Delhi traffic. 
hotel westend inn ,"Avoid if possible Stayed here for one night en route back to the UK. I didn't pay for the room myself, but was aware of how much it cost. For the price, I have to say I was expecting a lot better.Start with the positives: room was spacious, and the marble floor gave a sense of luxury. Then the negatives: the furniture was a little bit worn, and somewhat dusty. The bathroom was very poor, the walls had patches of mildew and the fittings were covered in limescale. The toilet, even though it had the &quot;sanitary seal&quot; on it, had clearly not been cleaned with a toilet brush. The windows were covered in dust.However, the worst problem was the noise. The room overlooked a small internal courtyard that was being used as a &quot;utility&quot; area, and the staff were washing dishes late into the night. I put up with this, despite being woken up by the noise at 1230AM and about 115AM. When it happened again, at 230AM, I called the reception. The attitude of the duty manager (I think) was not helpful; he suggested that I was imagining things (I could see the pile of washed crockery out my window), and then said he was &quot;socked&quot; (sic) that this happened etc. At 230AM, with a flight to catch the next day, I came close to &quot;socking&quot; him myself :-) I saw him go down there, and things quietened down, but started again at 7AM.For what it's worth, a colleague stayed in the same hotel a few days earlier and found it fine. There are apparently &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; rooms, maybe I got the old rooms. "
hotel westend inn ,"Nightmare Missed a flight out of Delhi airport and scrambled for a place to stay. Airport staff pronounced this &quot;Westin&quot; -- imagine my surprise! A true nightmare. I had to laugh that they called the room I got a &quot;super deluxe suite.&quot; The shower was made of three glass walls that joined with about an inch gap between them AND NO CAULK. A shower flooded the place entirely. Internet did not work. Guests were hoodlums. Food at the restaurant was abysmal. I'm pretty sure there were fleas in the bed. Took them 2h to send a car to the airport to get me, and every time I called they said it would be there in 5 minutes. Stay away! "
hotel westend inn ,"Worst Service Worst rooms Avoid at all costs We stayed here because a travel agent booked us in saying it is a 4 star.1. Check in was pathetic, they always give a bad room first. They will change to better room after you complain.2. They will say no payment was made by travel agent; but that was not always the case &amp; makes your checkout longer.There seem to be preferential treatment to foreigners for some odd reason. "
hotel westend inn ,"Fewer stars than you might expect! We were part of a British group booked into this hotel for two nights while touring Delhi. This was a change from our original hotel itinerary in the Delhi area -- and it was somewhat disappointing. On the plus side, it is close to the airport. But in most regards it is not up to strong standards if you are looking for a four or five star hotel. This is two or three stars in Paris at best (and yet it is far from any tourist sites and shopping). The dining room food was adequate, although some in our group went hungry (not liking the few choices). Breafast selections especially were limited. The pool is fine and lovely in the afternoon, but sunset does bring mosquitoes (be sure to have and use your spray). The English language is a challenge for some of the staff, so communication can be humorous or frustrating. The property itself is not bad and has potential. However, some aspects of the rooms are rundown and needing more diligent and regular ongoing maintenance. The hotel is in three buildings. One has a lift, the other two (on two floors each) do not (just so you know). Overall, this hotel was a disappointing ending to our week in India -- our other hotels, in Agra and Jaipur, had been so very much nicer, cleaner, and better run. "
hotel westend inn ,"Nightmare. Avoid at all cost I am an Indian living in the US. I am extremely patriotic and proud of India. But this is not about India, just a WARNING about this hotel.I was transiting via Delhi and had to spend the night. The airport counter recommended this hotel and gave me a ride to the place.- Check in went on well- Noticed a party going on in one of the rooms with loud music and over 50 guests and called the front desk if they knew about a party and when it would end. The sound was reverberating since the rooms were all facing an open center area and the volume was way up on the powerful sound system.- Response: &quot;No we don't, there is no party&quot;. (Hmm that's an odd response right?? )- By around 10:30 PM it was getting louder and the children were running around knocking on doors waking people up.- This triggered a whole bunch of guests (mostly people transiting and spending just the one night weary and tired) to come out of there rooms and complain.- Now the staff said they knew about a scheduled &quot;Reception party&quot; in one of the rooms and did not let people know during check in and that they cannot ask the people to reduce their noise &quot;since they were in their room&quot;.For crying out loud, there are over 50 people spilling out of the room, loud music reverberating and children running around knocking on all doors.Its very odd that a hotel would ignore all their guest for a party. It may very well be that they got a whole bunch of money for it, but shouldn't a hotel of this standard live up to it. The party went on till well over 2:00 AM. In spite of guests complaining and simply too tired from their travel do walk out of the hotel.Now don't even get me started on the service at &quot;breakfast&quot;, where there were over 8 staff helping around 10 guests, where two of them were ganging up on an American guest for taking a second cup of coffee. Apparently each time you take anything, they need to note it down and put it on your tab.Back at the airport, I asked the same counter which recommended this place and found that a lot of people have bad experience at this place and that they are forced to recommend this place since the owners are politically connected.Now i truly believe that all the &quot;Stars&quot; that this place may have or get, is all because of the political connections. "
hotel westend inn ,"stay away very run down, dirty and mosquito ridden - don't believe the non-smoking policy, there are no non-smoking rooms and they all smell of stale cigarettes. The front half of the attached building is collapsing, half demolished, looks like an earthquake zone. Definitely not 4* quality but if you can get a really, really cheap deal it's manageable for one night. Buffet was disorganized but OK. Yes it's close to airport but nothing else is. "
hotel westend inn ,"Worse hotel experience in 20 years... On the basis of description found on the web, I expected to have 2 relaxing nights in a hotel with small garden and swimming pool. In fact, the only positive facts about it are: (1) it is close to the Airport (indeed, you hear the planes) and (2) it has a swimming pool (which you may not need so much if your aim is to sleep...). In short, a collection of the worst imaginable:- doors are paper thin, and windows have single pane which, as the hotel is next to a major highway, means constant traffic noise, and full 'perception' of hotel noises as well - in fact, we did not sleep for more than 50% of the nights we spent there...- staff is at best strange, usually fully dismal: receptionist not really speaking English (understands AM for PM and therefore your airport pickup is not there, for instance) - also loving to wash the floor and clean the rooms in the middle of night, preferably making as much noise as possible in the process, and speaking really loud, so you have no chance to sleep- sub-optimal food- particularly gloomy court for dinner and breakfast- not-so-clean bathrooms- no customer service and attention,- and the cherry on the pie: our second night, a drilling rig was operating (a large one, to dig a deep well) just 10m from our bedroom - at 8pm I called: 'will stop in 5 minutes', at 8:30 'will stop in 1 minute', at 9 I called the manager, at 9:15 I went to fetch the manager myself and drag him literally to the rig, at 9:15 I had to bring the manager again, and finally at 9:30 the rig stopped operating...the staff that said 'it will stop in xx minutes' not only did nothing, but did not even check - they just replied this to keep us 'happy' -in short, I did not believe it could get that bad, particularly at that price. STAY AWAY BY ALL MEANS! "
hotel westend inn ,"Stay Away The tour company I used booked me here for my first night in Delhi. I was appalled. There were mosquitos in the lobby, and the entire place looked like it was falling apart. The walls were stained, the pool had no water in it, and the bedsheets were visibly dirty. The towels were gray, there was no shower curtain (though the curtain rings were still hanging), and I felt it necessary to shower in flip-flops. The only bright spot was the inexpensive internet access that allowed me to look up alternatives for my return to Delhi later in the week. "
hotel westend inn ,Sehr schlechtes Hotel! 
hotel white house ,Clean and worth considering we booked up at the White House through Colourful Indian holidays as part of a round trip in Northern India. They chose the hotel and we looked it up and it seemed fine. It was very respectable inside. Bedrooms were air conditioned and spacious and bathrooms well equipped. Our room at the front was a wee bit noisy especially as fireworks were going off for Diwali and the stray dogs were barking but very little traffic. the area is not all that selubrious but the restaurant on the roof had quite a good selection so you did not need to venture out in the evening. One hic up we arranged to stay the night on our return and they denied knowlewdge of our booking - left us waiting wondering what was going on then asid it was £7 DEARER THAN QUOTED All seemed a little strange.So good value but I would be cautious if you book in advance - their knowledge of english is not great 
hotel white house ,"Clean I would rate this hotel as average-good in terms of cleanliness &amp; food.Location is ok, and was good for access to Karol Bagh/Connaught Place during the day but as a lone travelling female did not feel overly safe in the evening, though think this would apply to other hotels in the capital anyway.I too booked a pre-arranged taxi from the airport which did not turn up &amp; had to haggle on my own at 02.00am so would not rely on this selling point.On my first am, going down to reception for a stroll of the local area I was told a taxi had been arranged for me to arrange a tour of the city. Altough annoyed at first that they'd arramegd my own time I went along with it &amp; would actually reccommend this if you have free time as I negotiated a reasonable price for 1.5 day tour of all the main tourist points in Dehli old &amp; new town in an a/c car and although stopped off at a cple of shops over the 2 days found this not to be an uncommon situation when getting transport in India.I would also be aware/take all booking details with you as I was charged slightly more than I booked for.However Overall I would reccommend this hotel as long as you are wary on prices/booking arrangements. "
hotel white house ,"Problematic I used this hotel to overnight between international and national flights.Website said they had Hotel pickup. I had to call to confirm and then they tried to charge me for it.The trip to national airport was double the usual cost.They said they would exchange money at 39rs/dollar..the then current rate. in the morning . I was in a time crunch and believed them. When it came time to exchange money the rate was 37rs/dollar.The rooms had peeling walls and some mold..They were clearly dishonest in their advertising and behavior. I am sure there are worse hotels in New Delhi, but for the price and the conduct of these people I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere. (I paid $70 US) "
hotel white house ,"touch above the average Travelling from UK,we used this hotel(on the fringe of Carole Bagah mkt) twice-at the beginning and end of our india tour for one night on each occasion. The double room was quite generous and , situated to the rear of the building, not overly affected by street noise.However, since the hotel finish was predominately marble, including the floors, we did suffer from some in-house disturbance where the occupants above insisted on dragging the furniture around the floor for some reason with the resulting clangour a mite irritating. All aspects were Clean Clean Clean and this is why, after reading some reviews of what can be had in Delhi, we gave 4/5. Rooftop restaurant was quite enjoyable although slightly restricted menu-wise. The food was fresh though and the service friendly. A hotel that delivered all that we needed and we would use it again because it throws up no horrors and avoids the lottery of selecting an alternative.NB this hotel selected for us by our tour operators-&quot;COLOURFUL INDIAN HOLIDAYS aka PACKAGE TOURS INDIA -if you want the seeming contradiction of a fully superior service with huge savings while touring India, take our unreserved recommendation. Superb throughout. "
hotel white house ,"Be careful Stayed here for a week although went on a tour for 3 days.I had arranged an airport pick up direct with the hotel via email but no-one was there to meet me on arrival at the airport,so had to haggle a price with a taxi to get me to the hotel at 2.00 in the morning.On arrival at the hotel was told that there was a fault with the electricity in my room and would have to stay at another hotel round the corner,which was a hovel-the fridge constantly buzzed and when I thought of pulling the plug to shut it up-on seeing the wires(without plug)fed directly into the socket,I thought better not to.The next morning when I finally checked in to my room,my initial impressions were that it was cleaner and generally in better state of repair than the one the previous night but it left a lot to be desired.Rooms are noisy and hot water is limited.Breakfast is basic but ok.Don't change money in the hotel.You'll get a very poor rate and it is not official, ie no encashment certificate and straight out of the receptionists pocket.Karol Bagh area looks dodgy but is quite safe as long as you take basic precautions.Only really used hotel as a base to sleep as there's not much else to do.Not far to connaught place by taxi/rickshaw.For the money you could find somewhere much better. "
hotel white house ,"Okay Stay But Ripped Off We had 2 stays in this hotel in Feb 2007....2 nights when we first arrived in Delhi and one night on our return from touring Northern India.It was booked for us through a tour group we used to organise a tour of India. Location-wise, it is not bad. Its not far from the shopping district of Karol Bagh. There is an internet cafe/phone booth just down the road. There is a small shop next door to the hotel from where you can buy bottled water and snacks.Our first stay was okay. We found the rooms to be moderately clean. The rooms didn't have any windows and the air conditioner didn't work, thus the room got stuffy. The bathroom was alright, if a bit on the shabby side.Through the night, we heard the incessant beeping that is synonymous with India's roads. There was also endless barking of stray dogs. Ask for a room on the side not facing the road - it will be much quieter. Also ask for one of the end rooms - they have small windows which will help with the stuffiness issue.The food in the &quot;rooftop&quot; restaurant is nothing to write home about. I was a little hesitant eating here as it didn't look very clean. There isn't much lighting there during the night - possible to hide the stains on the tablecloths.For our return stay we had booked 3 rooms for 3 nights (we were 3 couples travelling together). But when we arrived, we were told that one of the rooms had been &quot;cancelled&quot; by us. We ended up sleeping 3 people to a room. The next day, we got our tour group to organise another hotel for us, which was closer to Connaught Place.An okay place to stay if its a short stay and you are on a budget. "
hotel white house ,"Very bad experience I checked in this hotel with my daughter and wife on 30th April night for 3-days. The 1st thing which was very shoking to us was the condition of the bed. The bed sheets and pillow covers were full of stain and were of lowest quality. On our complain the staff brought the new bed sheets. They were equally bad. Major drawbacks of this hotel what I have noticed are:1. Location is at a market place. Surrounding area is dirty and full of people2. Hotel rooms are stuffy3. Hotel itself is cramped. No space even for taking a stroll leisurely4. Breakfast is not at all worth for money5. Staffs are not friendly. If you are not careful cheating will be the inevitable experience in this hotelMy good advise to any fellow traveler, especially foreighners, to avoid this hotel entirely. "
hotel white house ,"Rip off artists We booked directly with the hotel in September 2006 for a one night stay in October and a three night stay in November. As we were staying four nights, we were offered two free pick ups from the airport. We provided our credit card details as security.When we arrived at the hotel in October, we were asked to pay for the pickup. The bills was different to the agreed rate - the receptionist tried to charge us more - fortunately we had copies of our correspondence with us. We asked for two club rooms and were given standard rooms and charged club prices. We were given very noisy rooms overlooking the street.Despite this, we confirmed our bookings before we left for November as we did not at that date, want to go to the trouble of finding another hotel.The day we were due to check in, we called the hotel to confirm our pickup form the airport. We were told that our reservations had been cancelled as we had not provided confirmation - I don't see how this can be as we confirmed in person and wathced the receptionist write down our requirements in their reservations book. We were left in a lurch as there were virtually no hotel rooms left that night in Delhi due to a medical conference. Do not book with the White House - the reservation policy cannot be relied upon at all and they do not appear to honour their own pricing policy for their rooms. "

hyatt regency delhi ,"Best beds in India I am not a fan of Delhi, in fact the Hyatt is the best thing there. Wonderful comfortable beds, great bathroom amenities (the lavendar bubble bath is lovely). Great service, fast internet, reasonable location for the airport. Delhi can be very smelly, and quite dirty, the Hyatt is a welcome respite from it. There is a pool but I've never gone out to it, the air is to vile! Great spa and fairly priced, excellent jet lag massage "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Very good 5-star hotel I stayed in this Hyatt in new Delhi for 4 days. I arrived early in the morning (7.00 am) and the staff immediately arranged me in my room without any additional charge. My room was in the 8th floor, big enough, with fine decoration, flat screen TV, coffee maker, mini bar etc. The bathroom, however, was small, with old fashion furniture, in need of renovation. Nevertheless, my stay was fine and relaxing. The lobby area was really impressive! The hotel has several restaurants (international, chinese, east Asian, Indian) as well as a beautiful bar with live music in the evenings. Breakfast was very good, with a lot of items, and with live cooking stations. I had a dinner in the East Asian restaurant: very very good, althought pricey. Also, I had a dinner in the &quot;Aangan&quot; Indian restaurant, located in the lobby floor: the quality of food was excellent, the service too, and the live indian band playing traditional indian music was fantastic. Finally, there was a gym and fitness center with sauna, jaccuzzi, outdoor swimming pool etc, all of high quality and beauty. All the staff in every department of the hotel was extremely helpful and polite, always with a smile. All in all, a memorable, luxury and relaxing stay! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Very nice but not the best We stayed two nights here and I would first commend the service at this hotel. The staff were alert, attentive and courteous at all hours day and night, even if my appearance was a bit disheveled after the 15hr flight from Chicago! I dined at the Cafe and the Italian restaurant, and the quality of food was very good at both - the cafe in particular had a wonderful selection of breakfast items and an open kitchen where you could see the chefs at work or make special requests. I stayed in a standard king room, which was quite small - a mirror lined one full wall to create an illusion of space. The bed was fairly comfortable but not impressively so. There were fine complimentary chocolate truffles by the bar and a large LCD TV on the wall across from the bed. The bathroom was also nice with lavender scented amenities, which were ok. I was a little annoyed that the bathrobe had not been washed from the previous guest, but there was a spare in the closet. Overall, this was a fine 5 star hotel but I have stayed at other 5 star hotels in India that were about the same price but which felt a lot more luxurious than this one. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Business Hotel We travelled to this hotel with Cox and Kings as part of a package, this was the first hotel we stayed in, the hotel is what I would call a business class hotel, it offers a high level of service, but at a price! The room was nothing special, it did smell a bit musty, large television and decent channels, we ate in the Aangan resturant each night and the service and food was excellent, although very costly. As an indication when we did visit the bar (Polo Lounge) 650ml of Stella cost 800 rps. Overall we liked the hotel, but compared to others on the trip it was extremely expensive. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good Bssiness Hotel Great place to stay. I was only there for one night before while retrning from US to Banglore, but it's a beautiful place.

hyatt regency delhi ,"Excellent Service. I stayed in the executive floor for over two weeks, and can say that I had a great stay.The lounge staff are very friendly and efficient. The airport transfers were very smooth. As someone stated the hotel looks drab from the outside, and there isn't much to see or do within walking distance.The rooms aren't the biggest. The water pressure from the shower was poor. My biggest complaint would have to be the internet. It was painfully slow, and the connection would drop far too much. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Quality hotel with very friendly staff This hotel looks a bit gloomy from the outside, but I found both my room and the facilities to be top notch. The Hyatt website allows you to book all kinds of things through it, ranging from airport transportation, spa treatments to a restaurant table. I found this a very handy feature.I had booked a King Executive room, which included airport transportation. It was efficient enough, but in my experience the pickup by other hotels is a bit friendlier, offering you cold water and even a cold towel. Check in at executive level very efficient and friendly, and generally the staff couldn't do enough to accommodate you. I had an early flight the next day, but they arranged breakfast to be set out for me in the Club even though breakfast would open not for another hour. Restaurants: I can really recommend the China Kitchen, it's an experience with friendly staff and in a lovely setting. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Serious comfort"" Beautiful lux rooms to wash away the hectic Delhi circus~The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have had.I am confused as to why other travelers say it is not up to Hyatt standards, I just returned from a lovely stay at the Hyatt in San Francisco, and while perfectly adequate, the Hyatt in New Delhi is light years better...Stay there.

hyatt regency delhi ,"Absolutely unacceptable Was on a 2 week trip to India and wanted to finish my vacation in a nice hotel. Therefore stayed here for 2 nights in late August 2009. I found this hotel to be absolutely unacceptable for this price. It looked as if it is not Hyatt Regency. The carpets in the corridors and the furniture in the rooms were completely outworn. The check-in process was not good. We were a group of 3 people. One of us got a room with 2 twin beds and two of us - a room with one king bed, contrary to what was booked. In one of the rooms, water was flowing from the walls. So trust me - do not stay at Hyatt in Delhi, because it's truly not a Hyatt. Better chose Leela Kempinski at which I also stayed and which (although not ideal) offers much more for the same price. Hyatt in Delhi is some sort of Soviet type of hotel. "
hyatt regency delhi ,over priced I have booked through Jet airways website under the Hotel booking section as it was offering competitive rather cheap rates in the club floor. Check inn was at the club level special desk and it was smooth. The club lounge is basic and simple and attendants are always attentive and overly curious. The breakfast at the club lounge was very basic English breakfast. Rooms are clean and soft bed with wider option of pillows.The best part of the hotel is its restaurants and room dining. Variety of options and the Italian one is a must try. Over all good experience 
hyatt regency delhi ,"Terrible Hotel Avoid at any cost while you are in Delhi Probably the worst stay ever in any hotel in India, I arrived after a long flight from London in the afternoon and after the massage went stright to a meeting and when returned in the evening called the Reception to advice the Air conditioning is not working. The technician came and checked and advised there is nothing wrong with it, it will be cool soon. the whole night the temp didnt go below 25degrees centrigrade. As this wasnt enough, although I had put a Privacy sign outside, the Housekeeping kept knocking the door at 9am asking it to be cleaned.Again I called the A/C guy to fix the air conditioning before going out in the afternoon&gt; having being told its been fixed I foolisly accepted, the room was hot once again for the whole night againand hence no sleep for two days, I only go to the hotels to rest and have a good night sleep, both night with temp over 25 degrees in the room I couldnt sleepOn Saturday I had dinner at the china place, the food was good but the champagne i ordered was flat, Restaurant mananger duly changed the bottle which turned to be flat again. He offered another one and by that time my patience was running out suprise surprise it was flat too, I just signed the bill and left leaving most of the champange in the bottle. Did I get offered apology or written off the charge, no way. its not the staff fault, I guess its my fault accepting to stay at your hotel for the first timeOn check out when asked how was the stay and when I explained an apology was duly given but apology doesnt give back the sleep which i didnt have for two days and fix the temp in the room and remove the frustration of the dinner without a decent glass of champagne which I was going to enjoy with my wife. The receptionist suggested to take off the spa charges as compensation which i refused as there was nothing wrong with the spa what was wrong is the charges for the room for two night and the bottle of champagne which should have never been charged as Hotel failed to provide the room at decent temp to sleep and still charged for the champagne which was flatThe receptionist promised to speak to the Rooms division Manager and the GM and lets see if they respond. I have been in the hotel business for the last 38 years and this stay in so called 5 star hotel takes the biscuit.Probably the worst hotel stay I ever had in India which prides itself with good hotels and great service which this hotel failed and should never be a HYATT as it doesnt deserve to me more than a 3 star hotelAshok UmmatCEO Brook Hotels Ltd "

hyatt regency delhi ,"Was disappointed - might try the Meridien in Delhi next time! After a wonderful stay at the Le Meridien in Mumbai - I was expecting the same or more at the Hyatt in Delhi....it wasn't to be.....I was shown to my room to check in - but upon arrival I smelt a &quot;funny smell&quot; - which I relayed to the check-in lady - she said she'd send house keeping to freshen up the room. The actual room itself was spacious and newly decorated....however after checking in - I noticed an ash tray...which explained the smell - I called receiption striaght away - as I'm a non smoker - I asked to change rooms - as the smell would not just disappear!! As I had to rush out to dinner - they moved my bags and room for me - so upon my return - I was in a new room - with a view of the pool.....but the room was older - and as not as plush as the first one - was very disappointed - but couldn't be bothered to move again!!The breakfast in the morning was not as good as the Meridien - I struggled to find anything I wanted to eat and settled for pancakes instead.The lobby area isn't very comfortable - and nobody attends to you - I didn't really enjoy this hotel as it wasn't as &quot;cozy&quot; as the meridien and as a solo traveller - this was what I needed.The business room was ridiculous - it was more like an &quot;interview&quot; room - and they wanted 1,000 rupees for an hour - to sit at what looked like somebody's desk???I won't be coming back - I'd rather try another Meridien!!

hyatt regency delhi ,"Surprising Renovation Went to stay for 1 night for my Business purpose. It is a luxurious property, and I was looking for some Luxurious treatment, to unwind after my gruelling Meetings. However, I was dissapointed in some rspect. Firtsly, There was NO Bathtub in the room!!!!!! On top of that, there was no cover for the Shower area, which left the whole bathroom wet. In the spa, I tried to book a female massuer for the next day afternoon, and she was booked for the whole day till lare evening!!!!!! Surprising.I did complain for the above at the time of C/o, but no one got back to me.Even then, I do lik the overall experience, most of all excellent Staff Quality. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Not a good 4 Star hotel When compared to the other Hyatt Regency in India, this ranks the worst. The room is smaller than the otherRegencies . This is my second stay in 8 days. My club room has a toilet that flushes badly. I pity the cleaner when he goes around doing his work later today. I am going to stay in Le Meridien next week. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Outstanding wish more hotels were like this one We took our children to India so that they know their heritage. Booked three rooms at Hyatt and from the time we arrived in lobby we were treated well beyond expectation. Rooms though smaller but beautiful and luxurious. THe restaurants service was excellent and food was made to order for kids and for us.. I will go there again when I get a chance. Front office , checkin and regency clun staff is wonderful. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"for people with higher budget excellent five star hotel with notable ambience. overpriced, food good but highly overpriced. breakfast thopugh overpriced but worth that much "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Great Staff at Nice Hotel This was the only five star hotel that my husband and I stayed at while traveling around India. We stayed for two nights over a weekend in April. This hotel is spotless. Everything is extemely clean and spotless throughout the hotel. What I enjoyed most about the hotel was the breakfast. Breakfast was included with our room. It was a large buffet that had Indian, and Continental food. The servers were also very attentative and there was never a wait for seat. The dining area itself is large and open aired. I would recommend getting breakfast included. As for other hotel amenities there was a nice clean pool. We sat by the pool but the water was to cool for us to go in, but it was evening time. You can order drinks and lunch while lounging which is nice. There are several restaurants to chose from but we did not eat at any of them because we were always out in the city during the lunch and dinner. The hotel room itself was nice and modern. The room was an adequate size for India. The furnishing and flat screen TV seemed somewhat new. We did not have a view but we were not expecting a view knowing the location of the hotel. The room was nice and quiet. We never heard anyone in the next door rooms or hallway. In the mornings you could here a little honking but nothing compared to the louness of hotels we stayed at. The only thing that we did not like about the room was the bathroom. It was a good size but sort of ugly. It was clean but was a green marble color. This just is not our style and it really did not match with the rest of the room. The shower had hot water but the shower head itself sucked. It was small and the pressuse was not consistent out of it. The staff are very helpful and really seem like they care. We asked a lot of questions cause this was our first stop and first time in India. The concerige, front desk, and hall attendants were all the best that you would find.Overall we do recommend this hotel. It is clean and friendly, and has cozy modern rooms. I would say there are no major surprises with the hotel which is a statement that could be good or bad. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Needs a makeover! The property location is great and so is the staff and hospitality.The Business Centre was good and services availalbe on time. The check-in was great since I was on the club floor... and did not take more than a few minutes.The morning breakfast spread was strictly okay at the business lounge... may be with the selection of news papers and magazines, a few more stuff to eat may be great.Only thing to improves is the hotel decor .... it surely needs a makeover! "
hyatt regency delhi ,GReat Room It was a very pleasant stay at Hyatt during my cousin's wedding in January 2007. Hotel treated us very cordially. 
hyatt regency delhi ,"Excellent place great hospitality absolutely clean and IS WORLD CLASS Hyatt, Delhi is a great property. I love staying here. I had stayed in their property at S'pore and Mumbai as well. The rooms are excellent, coffee shop where the B'fast is served in one of the best, Staff are very cordial, they have great membership programme as well.Overall it is a world class property and a great place to stay. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good food at the indian restaurant Well hyatt is one of the most expensive and this trip thus wasnt really value for money. The hotel however has a good indian restaurant and when you are travelling to India after quite some time, you are happy with that. The rooms are ofcourse good and that helps in getting up every day morning afresh "
hyatt regency delhi ,"beautiful hotel My husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel our first night in India! It was a lovely hotel, and was closer to the airport than the downtown hotels. Would highly recommend it. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good Stay and Great Food Good modern and comfortable room . Great Bed , The Large LCD TV's are smartly placed . 100% recommended. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Lousy Service It started out well with my airport pickup. Then when reached hotel took over 30 mins to check in as my room was not yet ready, granted it was booked a month ahead.Wifi service goes on and off while you are being charged. Had to change over to broadband with the help of the staff.Room service - I ordered food at 10:30pm, I was told it will be served in 20 mins, it's now 12:24 am and still no food !!I was booked here for two more days, well i've just cancelled my stay here and moving myself to another hotel in delhi. I would definitely not recommend this joint to anyone. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Shocking experience! I called an hour before reaching the hotel. The central reservation desk was friendly and informed us of the various rooms and told us they had avalibility. Since a lot of rooms were avaliable we decided to book once we got to the hotel. We asked for a room at the front desk and were shocked to hear that rooms were not avaliable. We informed the front desk about the conversation we just had with the central booking office an hour ago. She asked us to call them since she had no rooms. We easily got a room by talking to the cental booking office. The lady who made our booking sounded shocked the the front desk had refused, she even asked us for the persons name. When we narrated the details to the lady at the front desk, she just smiled. She said she did that for security reasons????????We were unable to sleep for 2 days due to ongoing CONSTRUCTION. We heard furniture being dragged all night on the upper floor.In the morning we talked to the floor manager and housekeeping.They ASSURED US THAT SUCH A THING WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. We were naive, same thing next night. We called the reception and finally at 4am an offer to switch rooms. Really 4 am they expect me to pack and drag my bags????? At checkout we narrated the story to someone introduced to us as the manager. He apologised but had no explanation. Things are out of control...He only offered to compensate for our suffering by arranging a cab to drop us to the airport for free. We paid 300+ dollars each night, were lied to, treated in most unprofessional manner. Our compensation, free ride to the airport. I am at loss of words and truely shocked at the service and overall experience. I am from INDIA , living in the U.S., and have been a fan of this hotel for years. We frequented the coffe shops and various resteraunts. Great personal attachment to the hotel till I stayed there. Its sad! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"The other reviews are wrong We are very surprised by some of the positive comments in the last couple of reviews as we can only criticise - and we are not usually critical people. The hotel is still undergoing major refurbishment which means granite blocks are being machined noisily in the reception, covering everything in dust. The hotel staff seemed more keen to look after business events than people staying in the hotel, so that the pool was closed to 'guests' throughout our stay whilst they catered for weddings and the like! Drinks were ridiculously expensive £80 or $150 for a medium range bottle of wine and £12 or $22 for a gin and tonic! Our group felt very unwelcome and unwanted. As for location - how can anyone say it is near amenities? It is on a ring road on the outskirts of Delhi, and a minimum 40 minute taxi ride into the centre where all the sights are. Do not stay here unless you want to be surrounded by traffic and be close to the airport. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Great place for a layover Property – not the most attractive hotel in the world but it tries. The lobby is large and a bit over the top with a lot of black granite and brass; probably inspired by a visit to a Hindu temple filtered through a 1980’s ascetic sensibility. There are well over 500 rooms and many people from Delhi come here for the food, so the property is pretty busy well into the night. It is located in the south part of Delhi so getting to the main part of town for sightseeing is kind of a pain. Not that it is a bad thing but the armed guard, luggage screening and pat down at the front entrance was a little unexpected.Rooms- the rooms are a bit on the small side but there are some thoughtful touches that make them practical. The work desk rolls underneath itself so there is more room if you are not using it and the bathroom makes good use of space by having a half tub in the shower area. The toilet paper placement under the sink is a bit cumbersome. The bed was comfortable; the pillows were not. The room we stayed in could have used a bit of updating as the walls were a bit marred and some of the granite in the bathroom was chipped. The hallways leading to our room smelled musty and there was carpet coming up here and there. They also had a tendency to leave housekeeping trolleys in the hall for hours on end and, since the halls were kind of narrow, this was just a nuisance.Amenities – like a city unto itself, the 7 restaurants [including some of the best Chinese food outside of Hong Kong], large gym, spa [fairly good massage menu] with beauty shop facilities, and an arcade with shopping make a good case for never leaving the hotel. The concierge can arrange for city tours and to have medications delivered from a local [reputable] pharmacy. The pool area is OK with a good number of loungers if getting sun is your thing [or being outside in Delhi is your thing]. One advantage to the Hyatt is that, besides the Radisson, it is the closest 5 star hotel to the Delhi Airport, approximately 25 minutes with light Delhi traffic, 15 minutes at 2AM. All in all, it is pretty good place to be stuck for 24 hours waiting for a flight out of Delhi.Staff – The Hyatt will win no awards here. Admittedly, we had just come off a 3 night stay at the Oberoi, so my expectations were a bit high. The driver who picked us up and dropped us off at the airport was a very nice chap but that was pretty much it. The staff seemed cold and little things like asking for a phone number for my airline from the concierge desk seemed like a chore. The wait staff in the restaurants was friendly if a bit overbearing. The reception staff at The Regency Club took forever to check us in and just about as long to check us out.Overall- a nice place to hang out if you are waiting for a flight out of Delhi. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Flawless consistent service. Stopped for a week and also used one of their conference rooms. The staff would bend over backwards for you. There were renovations going on but we were well informed and the rooms were clean and tidy. We ate in every restaurant in the hotel and would recommend the 'china kitchen' The food and drink was great but very expensive, especially the wine, a glass of new zealand sauvignon blanc was £10. Get out of the hotel and jump in a tuc tuc to PVR priara for a cheap authentic meal. Don't let the beggers outside the hotel put you off, the hyatt is pure luxury, the health club is great too. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good Hotel.. but watch out they rip u off Well its a good hotel, was quite clean service was good. It is very close to the airport and was one of the main reasons for me to book it. Has a good japanese steak house and a great coffee house. But for those singles this place does not have a nit club. The room was clean with hardwood floors and a nice view. I liked everything about the hotel cant complain.. now the bad stuff. I got the room for around 200 dollars/nit for the week of indepence day which was reasonably good, except after the trip when i returned back to america i was charged 250/nit.. on my credit card even though the online bill says 200, i called hyatt office in usa and they asked me to contact the hotel in delhi. I thought it was not worth it i rather not stay there anymore. Secont billing issue i had was for the car i rented during my stay. they provided me with a camry, aparently the lady in the front dest quoted me 2000 rs/8 hours. I decided to clear my bill the nit b4 i check out and while i was paying my bill i realized i was billed 4500 rs/8 hrs .. I tried talking to the manager she was quite rude basically saying she cant help it..as she didnt quote the price to me. I paid it in full. next day while i was checking out..i saw the girl who had quoted me the price.. i asked for the manager .. i explained everything that happened.. a new manager had come in .. she talked to the staff and refunded me the money.. ..I beleive they should have waived the taxi charge for .. they had caused all that drama .. and it was their fault. But ofcourse they didnt.. and when i finally reach america.. they charged me extra for my room ... awesome hotel .. i m never going there again. "
hyatt regency delhi ,nice service nice place to be 
hyatt regency delhi ,"loved the service their service was excellent.all the time they were asking for snax,food,tea etc.and they gave me all that with good manner. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good experience overall Our company's team of 9 stayed here for a week and overall we had a good experience. We stayed on the club level which was very helpful. We made good use of the lounge and there was a conference room we reserved for one day of our stay. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful and when I asked for a room change to move further away from the public area, they were very accommodating.Our rooms were clean and comfortable. We found the food at the club lounge very good and a nice mix of indian and continental. The italian restaurant was really good and highly recommended when you need a break.My major complaint is the check in and check out process. When our group arrived they took our passports and appeared efficient. They are not. It took almost two hours, they got hopelessly confused and we didn't get to our rooms until after midnight. We also get a complimentary ride back to the airport and even though I tried to confirm, it was clear that they did not have it recorded anywhere when we got to the concierge to leave. To be fair, they pulled it together but when flying international, this is something I want to work like clockwork. Lastly, the internet connection is flaky and our connections would often get dropped which was pretty frustrating at times.Overall, for business, it was a good (not perfect) experience and I wouldn't worry about staying here. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Mixed bag The hotel is truly a mix of the good and the bad. The pros are its proximity to the airport, city center and fairly good restaurants. The negatives start with the fact that the hotel does not disclose that it is undergoing renovations anywhere on its website. I stayed in room 241 and had to walk past several rooms with unnumbered doors that were open and the interior gutted! Despite recent renovations to the room, the mattress sagged and I ended up sleeping in the middle so as not to get a sinking feeling. The hotel also &quot;mistakenly&quot; charged me for an airport transfer when I did not use one . This seemed somewhat deliberate as when my local contact called to see if they had sent a car to the airport to pick me up, he was told that there was no booking! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Awful Experience Recently, stayed in Hyatt Delhi (October 2008). After paying Bomb, I had very bad experience with your so called &quot;5 star hotel&quot;---. Following were the issues:--Reservation was done online, on Hyatt's site but did not have room as per our requirement reserved.-Reception allots me room which already had guest staying. It was very embarrassing to walk into room with guest sleeping.-Next Room allotted was not as per our requirement, we took it as we were very tired. Whole process took 45 minutes.-ROOMS HAD COCKROACHES.-Room Service staff could not take order properly.I had to call three time to get correct and complete order. Once I received order it was cold and barely edible.I would never recommend stay in Hyatt for kind of Service they offer, after charging bomb. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Not the best saty but not the worst either Stayed 3 nights in a King room. Burned Gold Passport points for 2 of them. Check in was not smooth. Room was not ready and it was after midnight. There are a lot of airline crew that stay here so that is probably why. Finally did get into our room. Smallish. Comfy bed. Internet worked. Bring earplugs if you have an exterior facing room as there is constant honking or horns. The hotel is big and usually full so things are going to happen. This includes service snafu’s and maintenance issues. Every guest you encounter will have something good and bad to say however a lot of the guests are very repeat guests so that says that they are for the most part happy about their experience. They do work hard to make things right if it is brought to their attention that you are not satisfied. I was actually impressed by this. The restaurants with the exception of the 24 hour restaurant, which is not really 24 hours, were good. After I got home it was not clear if the VAT on the cheques in the restaurants is really a VAT or a gratuity so you might want to clarify this when you are there. Nice busy pool and once you got the staff attention they were attentive. Lots of pigeons and other birds to watch, and occasionally dodge the you know what. Lots of F/A’s and pilots so plenty of interesting conversations around the pool and in the bar. Met some great people.I had some interesting emails with the concierge desk prior to my arrival but it all worked out in the end. The city day tour they arranged included a stop at a rug place that I found a total waste of my time not to mention high pressure sales so have your driver/guide skip that part of the tour. The rest of it was fine. Don’t let anyone tell you it is a couple of hours to Agra. It took us almost 5 hours to get back because of the traffic was at a stand still. It ended up being a very long day indeed from 6:00a until almost 10:30p. If you are expecting an intimate hotel with a smooth as silk service experience like you will find elsewhere in Asia this is not the best place for you. This hotel is perfectly fine for most travellers if you are prepared for the occasional wrinkle along the way. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Expensive poor service and poor breakfast I spent only two days with my mom in this hotel in the end our trip to India. The hotel, restaurants and rooms are nice. It is expensive and the service is poor. The toillet was blocked and we spent two hours waiting for someone to fix the issue (actually we checked out without solution for the problem). The breakfast was also an issue if you don't like to have indian food: all pastries looked like have been made a week ago. The bread was dry and hard. We got very disappointed since the restaurant looks pretty good (LOOKs only). The frontdesk was also very rough. Our advice is to get a reservation in The Park hotel chain, since the service and food is just wonderful. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Ups and Downs We stayed 2 nights at the Hyatt Regency in New Delhi. Overall the experience was OK but there were several issues which meant I couldn't give this property a higher rating.Upon arriving the receptionist had some difficulty in finding our reservation despite the fact that we had called in a day earlier to confirm. This lead to some delays and was not the best start to our visit! We had been assigned to a standard room overlooking the pool. It was clean but very outdated (old fashioned bathroom with shower over the tub, old style TV). Our friend who was staying at the same hotel had gone for a Club level room and when we saw his room we decided to bite the bullet and upgrade. It took some time and a few phone calls to the Front Desk but eventually we were moved. What a difference! The Regency Club level rooms are all recently renovated with all the mod cons. They are still the same size as the normal rooms (i.e. not that big). I've uploaded some photos of both rooms so you can see the difference. Also included in the Regency Club rate was access to the Club Lounge (free drinks all day, alcoholic drinks and snacks from 6 - 8pm everyday), free Internet access (the broadband was fast) and free limo transfers to and from the airport.We tried the room service for dinner and breakfast - both were very good although a bit slow to arrive. We also ate at TK's Grill which had decent Teppanyaki although the meat was a bit tough.Had the chance to try the pool, very nice although a bit small and strangely enough with a swimming lane right through the center effectively cutting it in half. Plenty of sun loungers around although it was a bit of a struggle to get any service (had to walk over to the pool bar area to get drinks). We also tried the bar, very relaxing with live music and a nice atmosphere.Unfortunately there were renovations going on during our stay which meant that some parts of the hotel were closed off and there was some intermittent noises coming from the construction areas. Our room cards stopped working on the 2nd day and it took two trips to the front desk to sort them out.Also, be warned that one wing of the club level has been fitted out with a new system which allows use of a wireless keyboard to access the internet through the TV and do various other things. The other wing lacks this system and is still waiting to be updated. If you are travelling without a laptop make sure you specify you want one of these equipped rooms so that you can jump online without the hassle of having to go to the business center.My main problem with the hotel was the lack of value it represents. For the USD $500+ / night room rate we were paying I honestly expected a bigger room and flawless service. Unfortunately this was not the case. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Loved this Hotel We loved this hotel...Was not inexpensive, but loved everything about it. Staff was very pleasant &amp; helpful. Breakfast was good. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"loved it i like this hotel visit delhi mainly for business and was picked up every morning for work so i really dont know if location is a good one in my opinion there was nothing around or walking distance to see or visitevery restaurant visited was al least 20 minutes by carinside the hotel was perfect :room of good size ,perfectly mantained ,good business services and breakfastnothing to complain about was a joy arriving everyday after a long working day "
hyatt regency delhi ,"great - no complaints This was my second time at the Hyatt Regency in Delhi - the first time was two years ago and there were some things I didn't like then. This time I stayed a week and I have to say that everything was nearly perfect - nice room, comfortable bed, good restaurants, good service. The gym is pleasant and although the hotel was packed there were always enough machines. There is a newish Italian restaurant which is excellent, and a new Chinese restaurant which is even better. Although it is on a very busy road, the rooms are fully soundproofed and I didn't hear any of Delhi's infamous constant beeping.At the rear of the hotel is a large pool and pleasant garden where you can have drinks and light meals.My only small complaint was that the bathroom fittings could do with refurbishment - taps need replacing, toilet flush was a bit lethargic etc. And also that the breakfast can be a bit chaotic when the hotel is full as it was during my stay - peak of the tourist season.But I would stay here again, definitely. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Not worth the big bucks Spent 2 nights, one at top USD, the second using Hyatt Gold Passport points. We were advised by friends to stay in 5 Star Deluxe Hotels while in India, good input... your hotel will be your sanctuary. So, in Delhi we selected the Hyatt Regency, it's expensive. Excellent bar, excellent buffet breakfast, the top-USD room was small and clean. The Gold Passport room was smaller, unclean, dirty and lacked furnishings. So, food and drinks are good, but room is average, not worth the USD. E.Taylor, NC, USA "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Hyatt Regency New Delhi Regency Club Level Floor 6 I looked on trip advisor for a while before making my decision on the Hyatt. I had read a few things before my trip to New Delhi but still arrived feeling like I had not prepared enough. I came to realize extremely fast if you want things done in New Delhi get the tipping wallet ready. This place is worst in tip for value then Las Vegas in general. The hotel is pretty nice over all and yes service is pretty good if you are willing to dump a few Rupees on tips. I found that advice prior to my trip that 30 rupees is pretty good which most cases was but if you want something done and fast 100 rupees up gets what you want pretty darn fast and with a smile. If you don’t plan on tipping then I suggest you don't stay at a 4 star up hotel in New Delhi. I decided on this room because reading other reviews on hotels in general in New Delhi the level of service and accuracy of things is very low. So I figured I would try to find the best place with a good name and find a top room. The Hyatt I like in general as a hotel because it has a national name and corporation behind so you can usually find customer service somewhere if all else fails. Being on the Regency level I was greeted at the airport by the hotel and shuttled off to the hotel. I arrived in the morning and they are pretty strict about the early check in deal so I dropped off my bags and already had a day trip planned to Agra. On returning to the Hyatt later in the evening I checked in on the 6th floor of the Regency Club and of course things can never be right. I had booked two rooms. One I booked on line at Hyatt and the other I booked online at Expedia. The room booked at Hyatt of course was accurate at check in but at check out they bumped up my price an extra 3000 rupees for some reason. I am still debating this with them and the credit card company. Not something I wanted to do and had previously read that they are notorious for this so great I am one of the statistics now. The other room booked through Expedia was a disaster. Expedia charges you the total room at booking through the website. So I paid the entire amount including taxes at the time of booking through Expedia. Well at check out Hyatt wanted to charge me again for the room and I was about to blow up at this point because things just didn’t go as planned. Well anyhow already running late to the airport I ran into the business center and printed off my Expedia confirmation and my credit card statement showing that I had already been charged and still Hyatt did not take it at face value but rather told me they would figure things out send me a bill later. Well lucky for me the Expedia room worked out and I was not double charged or I would still be debating that as well if I had not taken the time to solve it right then and their. So big suggestion if you decide to stay here bring all your reservation confirmations with you to check in and make sure the quoted or prepaid room is understood with the check in counter people at the time of check in it will save you a tremendous amount of time later in emails and telephone conversations with your credit card company and the hotel. The next morning I wanted to check out New Delhi so I hopped into a taxi and not knowing better told him to take me to the arch and he did not turn on the meter….oops. I learned that you are supposed to negotiate these fares or just rent the driver for the day. So I ended up understanding this fairly quickly and negotiated 1000 rupees for the day. That seemed to be the set rate for it was like this the remaining two days using other drivers. I also learned unless you like to be taken to the commission shops be direct and firm with the drive on telling him you want to go to specific places and don’t want to go shopping with him when you can just go to Connaught Place and stay away from the government emporiums unless you want to pay the premium. The way I understand it is that the government emporiums pay a kick back of 500 rupees to the taxi driver for just bringing you the emporium and then 50% commission on whatever you end up buying. So don’t go to the taxi driver suggested places for shopping rather just direct him to various places like Connaught Place. Don’t misunderstand this and think this is on the only place and no government emporiums in this area because there are more places and still government emporiums here in this area as well but you can surely see the difference. Just tell the taxi driver you want to start out by the Pizza Hut or KFC. They are clueless and think you just want to eat and tell him you will be back after a few hours. He isn’t going to take off because you haven’t paid him yet so take a nice stroll and shop, eat or whatever floats your boat. So now more about the hotel. One room I had gotten was just a Regency King and it was actually fairly small compared to other Regency Kings I have had in the past from other Hyatt’s. But it was OK nothing special other then the bottle water. The drain in the shower was horrible and flooded every time the shower was turned on. The other room was a Regency King Suite and was good size. It felt more like a Regency King room I am used to. It had a lovely sitting room and very accommodating in size and feel. The suite was a nice room for my friends to stay in because they had three travelers so two sleep in the king bed and the other in a roll-a-way. Very nice room and their shower seemed to work just fine. Being on the Regency level you get the breakfast in the morning and the drinks in the evening which is a very nice feature to staying on the Regency level and the staff is very friendly while serving you. Again a little tip at the end of the breakfast and night cap does some wonders for your stay. The staff is more appreciative and goes out of their way to help the tipper that is for sure. So good place to hand over 50 rupees after the end of breakfast and drinks for better enjoyment to your stay in the long run. I found the location of the hotel not to be very close to many things and at least 15 minutes from the sites. I ate dinner one night at the Spice Route at the Imperial Hotel and found the location of the Imperial fairly close to the sites so I may have to try that the next time I go to Delhi for the location seems much better off. The Hyatt just seemed away from it all. Highly recommend the Spice Route for dinner and make reservations at the Imperial hotel. Also the Hyatt has China Kitchen which serves fairly good Chinese food but again make reservations in advance for it feels up fast. The health club at the Hyatt is small and very busy for they allow outside membership. So if you want to exercise and enjoy the sauna at the hotel you can but be prepared for a small over used gym. Overall I found the Hyatt in New Delhi to be very TIP happy and OK if you are ok with tipping everyone at the hotel who may look at you or try to help you. I don’t think that is unusual thing for New Delhi in general. It seems to be a very TIP happy place which bugs me but at the same time I am already their so I want to enjoy my voyage and not let a few dollars get in the way of my enjoyment. Upon leaving give yourself plenty of time at the airport. Security is crazy for they have these big scanning machines that don’t do anything because I didn’t see one bag being opened but they require every bag to be placed on this thing for inspection. I don’t have a clue as to what it is suppose to do because a billion people are all trying to throw their suitcase onto this scan machine at the same time with really no organization to the whole thing and then clamoring to retrieve the bag at the end of the scan machine while some workers place a security check tie around your suitcase. It’s a joke and very time consuming. Do not try to check in until you have cleared the dumb scanning machine process. Immigration lines are long and slow and then again a security check again is required for your personal hand carry. Also don’t forget to get a stamp on your hand bag carry on because they won’t let you board the airplane with out a stamp on the carry on luggage tag. Again just take my word for it very TIME CONSUMING. New Delhi will tier you out! "
hyatt regency delhi ,Enjoyable hotel nice rooms and restaurants This hotel has an excellent standing. The restaurant are good for India. Our oom at the top floor was very well furbished and we had a warm welcome. The sauna was a good point for the evening. The only disappoint was a mistake on the bill at the departure but they corrected it on our request. 
hyatt regency delhi ,"Average experience This was not the best welcome to India. The service was pretty disorganized, and the location was out of the action of the city - this might suit some people but it meant having to negotiate public transport and taxis, not easy in this place! Rooms were okay, but nothing special. Not the cleanest bathroom either. I'd choose some where else next time. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Good for a short business stay - 2nd visit I stayed at Hyatt Regency in Delhi, this was my second visit. I think that somethings have slipped since last year when I stayed, such as concerige desk (had to remind them several times about car bookings). The food as always is good, the rooms are pleasant (although can be cold - I turned my ac off!) and the complimentary water is much appreciated.The staff are very helpful on the whole, although a little slow in the restuarant. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Excellent; somewhat pricey but great service Excellent hotel that made our stay in Delhi a worthwhile experience; check in was easy and the rooms average until we found that our friends were in newer plush rooms on the same floor whilst our rooms were the old style; upon request, the management bent over backwards to move us to the newer refurbished rooms as soon as these became available (later that night)....the flat screen LCD TV ; the wood panel ; the soft mattresses, the ambience and the transparent bathroom wall with the sensuous blue soft lights all reminded me of the high end boutique hotels in pricey Manhattan!!The room service was excellent; as was the health club with newer equipment - elliptical crosstrainers and treadmills with integrated TV monitors ; the massage treatments were truly a treat and fairly inexpensive by US standards. Their popularity was evident; by few time slots available for massage at short notice.Service speaks volumes in my book when the concierge willingly sent staff on motorbike for medication to a 24 hour hospital pharmacy some distance away from the hotel at 3am (to treat my sick child); and had the medication delivered promptly to our room!!Thanks Hyatt staff... I have traveled all over the world and rate you a true 5 star experience!! We will be back when we visit India &amp; Delhi "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Superb Hotel Fantastic Dining I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a week in August on a business trip to New Delhi. I found both the service and the facilities to be outstanding!The first thing you should know, don't bother scheduling pickup from the airport through the hotel. The price is outrageous. Simply grab a taxi from the airport and pay 300 Rupees maximum. If you are a westerner on your first trip to Delhi you may not be prepared for the tipping situations. Check the discussion forums here at tripadvisor for tipping information before you decide to accept assistance with bags etc.The hotel is, of course, not really walking distance from anything. I'm not sure if there is any hotel in Delhi that is walking distance from anything. But the area is decent enough. The entry and lobby are very nice, check in is easy, staff is excellent.The rooms are great. Very new looking. Housekeeping is simply superb, exceptional, fantastic! The beds are luxurious, the bathroom large, the amenities plentiful. LOVED this room. Internet is a little pricey. There are an abundance of channels on the television. The hotel restaurants are simply outstanding. Breakfast is delicious and loaded with options. Do NOT miss out on the italian restaurant. I just got back from Italy a couple of months ago and I can honestly say the restaurant at this hotel has the best Italian I've had in years. Do NOT miss it!The price of this hotel can be intimidating, but there are deals to be had for the diligent researcher. We booked at 170 USD per night. Not bad. In summary, this hotel stay was absolutely fantastic. I will be in town every August for the next several years and I fully intend to stay at the Hyatt each time. "
hyatt regency delhi ,Perfect stay Great Club room. Nice buffet in the evening and breakfast at the Club LoungeVery good spa with the best ayurvedic massage I've had in India!The staff is wonderful 
hyatt regency delhi ,"Perfect hotel for business travellers I first stayed at this hotel around 4 years ago and should have written a review back then, but sadly never got around to it. I went back to Delhi last week and again stayed at the Hyatt Regency. It really is a great hotel and worthy of a decent review. I'll start with the rooms which are nice and comfortable, if slightly dated. Lovely wooden floors and comfy beds. The bathroom provides all the basic amenities you would expect to find and more. There is a drain by the side of the bath that some of my colleagues noticed a smell from and even bubbles coming through but I myself had no problem with my own room. The service in the hotel is really great and extremely attentive. Wherever you are in the hotel, front desk, lobby, outside or any of the restaurants, you will find the staff extremely helpful and very polite. My friend and I ate in TK's which is an asian restaurant - we both rated it extremely high. The food and the service were perfect. It was far too hot for me to sunbathe by the pool, but I had a great view from my room and having been to the pool area on my previous visit, I can only assume the pool service is as good as ever. A great visit - highly recommend this hotel. "
hyatt regency delhi ,Excellent hotel to stay I had been to New Delhi for one night on a trip to get my US VISA from the American Consulate. I was booked at this hotel and the experience was really great.Mine was a club room up on the 6 th floor and it was very good.The hotel and its food is worth the price one pays to stay here.Strongly recommend. 
hyatt regency delhi ,"Expensive..... The Hotel is set between the city centre and the International Airport. On first arrival I thought the outside was nothing special. But the welcoming lobby was first class. The restaurants are excellent and whilst I was there the Hotel was adding a new Chinese Restaurant. The pool is not particularly large but adequate and the grounds are well kept. I was staying on the Executive 6 floor and this gave me access to a small buffet service.The room was clean but nothing special. My room was located on the side, providing me a restricted view of a side alley….nothing great there. The TV was old style model not a modern Flat plasma version. The programmes were basic, offering no pay-per-view. The room had Internet access but on this trip as I didn’t have my laptop. I used the internet room on the 6th floor (another is in the lobby). I was surprised and very disappointed to find a charge for this, having paid a lot more to stay on the Executive floor I would of expected this to be complimentary. I thought this was very petty.The Hotel staff are excellent and very professional, very polite and helpful. Overall I would say the price to stay at the Hyatt was very expensive and although I was staying on business and therefore not paying, I would not stay there again. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Avoid at all Costs!!!! The service at the Hyatt is great but, not worth the $300/night price. Our room had a door to an adjoining room through which everything could be heard. So, during our last nights stay the person in the other room decided to watch TV at 3am and we were woken up. If you are paying $300/night you should get a quiet nights sleep. Also, when we arrived back home I was sent a letter and bill for food taken out of the mini-bar which we never took . This hotel is a total rip-off. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Great service! We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dehli right after Christmas. Our flight was late out of Taiwan and the staff at the airport was really helpful, especially since we had two small children.We stayed on the executive floor and the room was beautiful and the staff was great. We went on a tour of Northern India the next day and stayed in the hotel again on our way out of India. The food was good and the hotel was great for our kids.I would recommend this hotel for a short stay with children but probably isn't a long term stay, since it really isn't near any of the sights in Dehli and is basially a business hotel. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Baautiful plce; they take care of you I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a business trip. There's not much around the hotel, which is typical for Delhi; dusty roads, honking horns, people on bicycles. My room was beautiful and well-supplied. I had an Internet connection problem after I checked in and within 5 minutes a young man in a suit was at my door to resolve it. (It was 11 PM Friday night.) I was admiring the plantings by the pool and an employee greeted me and told me the names of the plants. The Health Club was well-equipped and machines were always available.The one weakness this hotel had, in my view, was a smaller % of Indian food in the buffet; I'd previously stayed at the Grand, where they had a bigger selection that changed every day. If you like to stick to traditional Western food, there's plenty of it. I even saw a guy eating a steak, which made me cringe.My boss and I paid $300/night in peak tourist season; some people checking in the night I left were paying $500 and were complaining loudly and boorishly. I don't know if they had better rooms, but mine was a good value for $300. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"A great experience I recently stayed at the Hyatt in New Delhi. My room was quite large with plenty of room around my king bed. It was slightly cold and when I called the front desk to complain, they sent up a space heater that worked fine. The most impressive aspect was the concierge. I had several packages delivered to me and someone from the concierge not only brought them up, but helped me pack them which involved making a makeshift bag and weighing my baggage for me. Given my extra baggage, I was concerned that I might not be able to check in everything. When I departed the hotel, I was told that the Hyatt representative at the airport had been notified that I was coming and would help me. The Hyatt representative met me at the airport and walked me through the check-in process and helped me manage my baggage. I would never have been able to check-in if it was not for him.I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"My stay was fine! I enjoyed my stay here.I found my room a bit small, but comfortable and I slept well.Reception is large, modern and light and the staff met my requests just fine.I asked someone to get me some deodorant (as I forgot to pack any) and it was bought and brought to me in a meeting where I wanted it. Great!Restaurant, lots of buffet choice, western or Indian, good quality.We had a business meeting in the downstairs conference facility, which was excellent.Pool, I had a swim, and ordered a beer at the pool, and that was all fine. All in all, I would stay here again. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Nice Hotel I've read the reviews on this hotel, and I just don't get it. A lot of the comments may be true, but are really pretty minor problems, and they don't really warrent the negative ratings. It's almost as if the reviewers haven't stayed at 5 star hotels internationally.I was at the hotel from the 10th thru the 14th of October, and found the hotel to be good, and the service excellent. We were there for a conference, and were very pleased with the hotel.The rooms are small, but adequately sized with a king bed, desk with chair, and easy chair. The furnishings were fine - not worn - but the hotel is remodelling all the rooms, and are supposed to be finished shortly. The new rooms have furnishings to maximize the space, like glass desk top, headboard mounted on the wall, and bedside lamps mounted on the wall instead of nightstands. Some of the rooms apparently did not have temperature adjustment, but mine was adjustable.The food was very good. We had two catered lunches at Djinn's as well as a dinner with entertainment Friday night by the pool, with mulitple ethnicities of food (Indian, Italian, Arabic) and they were all very good. The service was excellent, so I don't know why other reviewers complained.One negative had to do with the mosquitos. The weather was unseasonably warm, and there is a dengue fever outbreak in Delhi (over 1300 cases with 50 deaths so far), so the hotel was constantly fogging outside and fumigating inside. The inside work was ineffective, though, and there were a lot of mosquitos inside. No one in our group was bitten, but we were swatting and nervous - even wearing &quot;Off&quot; during our conference.The hotel isn't within walking distance of shopping, but most foreigners wouldn't want to walk in Delhi anyway. There is a camp of homeless living under tarps across the street, and cows roam the streets, but that's just India. The pool area is gorgeous, though, so when you're in the hotel it's an oasis in Delhi. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"A professional hotel with systems that worked for us My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency the night of July 31. We paid a bit over $200 for the room. We had an excellent experience. The international airport pick-up was efficient. The room was comfortable, and the staff were friendly, professional, and helpful. Breakfast and lunch in the coffee shop were very good. My wife left her glasses in the lobby, and we were able to retrieve them from the lobby staff who found them and put them in the lost and found. We took a hotel taxi to the Ashoke Hotel and back for a reasonable fare. The drop off at the domestic airport was pleasant. The hotel is not within walking distance of any shops or commercial areas, so we had to change money at the hotel rate. But we would enthusiastically recommend the Hyatt Regency as good value for the money. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Shockingly Bad Hotel I always stay at Hyatt's as the name usually guarantee's some kind of standard - not in this case!!! The rooms are very, very old. They have not updated in the basic components such as electrical plugs and the ac, let alone the furnishing. The ac control does not even allow you to change the temperature!!!! All this would be ok except that they are charging $200. Not worth this at all "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Lot of $ for little For $300+ you would expect that you'd get the room that you reserve (King, non-smoking). Instead I got a smoking room and two twin beds pushed together. The Polo lounge was good and the atmosphere lively, but you also have trouble getting a seat in the place. Maybe because this was a Saturday night. All in all, it was just a average experience. The staff were helpful and attentive and that was the best part I guess. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Some of the staff do try to make a difference I wrote a review a few hours before checking out. It wasn't favorable.We were on a late (midnight) flight and after checking out and settling the extras bill for a couple of meals and some drinks (around 700us), used the spa to freshen up before dinner. I was not allowed a 20 R disposable razor as I had already checked out!That was the final straw. I couldn't wait to leave this place! On leaving through the lobby I met the hotel manager and told him what was going on in his hotel. Hotels in India, in my experience, are never that good. Maybe it's a cultural thing. The manager took the comments I made very seriously and appeared pretty surprised on investigation to find out what his staff were obviously hiding from him!He and his team took immediate action to ensure that the remainder of our evening in Delhi was as enkoyable as possible and that we would try the hotel again next time we visited.I'll try this place again next time I'm in Delhi. The manager genuinely seems to want to sort it out.I recommend if you have justified problems here and that aren't being dealt with that you inform the manager. If he's not available contact Hyatt regional manager. I suspect that when the reception says he's not available it's because they'd prefer their boss didn't find out what its like being a guest here.There are some great, helpful people working here who understand the hospitality business, they just need more of them! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"fine I used the hotel for a day room - so did not experience the facilities.It is a very busy hotel - the lobby feels like a train station - although it looks much smarter!It has a range of facilities, coffee shop, bar, restaurants , gym, and loads of boutiques selling goods for all pockets - from souvenirs to jewellery. It is quite close to the centre. The staff were all very polite and helpful with all my queries and requests however bags took a long time to get to my room and then to get loaded into the taxi on departure.The room was comfortable with all the amenities you would expect form a four star.I paid 350 rupees to get to the airport by a hotel recommended taxi, the hotel car costs 1300 "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Loved the Hyatt I stayed here while on business for two weeks and I loved it. The gym and spa were great, and the staff was extremely helpful. The buffet breakfast was included in my rate, and was a nice way to start the day, a nice mix of western and Indian breakfast foods and french pressed coffee. By day three, the waiters new I liked ketchup and tabasco and would have both waiting for me upon my arrival for breakfast. The rooms were a bit small, but were clean and nicely appointed. I had no trouble at with any of the temperature controls, the AC made the room cold, the heat made the room warm. "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Dreadful This Hotel is a joke. Out of date product in the mini-bar, rude staff, slow restaurants, expensive drinks, poor transportation, small rooms, ancient bathrooms and basic at that. Wouldn't advise even considering it!! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"We loved this hotel.... I think I must have stayed at a different hotel than the other reviewers. After 3 weeks on the road in India, we were lucky enough to use points to reserve a room on the club level. Highly recommend upgrading if you can. The room was lovely. It could have been a bit larger, but the decor, cleanliness and bathroom were are great. Apparently, we had the opposite experience with the service. Check in was done promptly on the 6th floor, they let us check out at 7:00 in the evening when we left with no additional charge, the wait staff on the floor were wonderful and we found the breakfast and evening drinks to quite nice. Also, having unlimited email access in the business center was very helpful.We enjoyed the bar and resaurant we went to in the hotel (though they are VERY expensive by Indian standards), but the best part was the spa. For about 30 bucks I got the best massage I have ever had. This hotel was a wonderful break in our travels and I would recommend it without a doubt. And, again, suggest upgrading to the club level for the best experience! "
hyatt regency delhi ,"Hyatt A disgrace Hyatt a 5 star hotel....having a laugh.The service is worse than what you get in a 2 star hotel. Not worth the money.Staff in Delhi Hyatt are inefficient and extremely rude! They do not know how to treat their customers. Not only that, they need to be fully trained to work at the front desk! Can't get a simple thing right!The restaurant in the Hotel is over priced. The food is ok. Although you have to order 3 hours in advance! Because their service is so damn slow.Rooms are also very small and bathroom is very basic.I would certainely not recommend this hotel to anyone!Delhi Hyatt definately gives a bad name to the Hyatt group of Hotels.

indraprastha hotel ,"Not as great as the pictures.... the staff were good, expect the driver (night) failed to turn up to pick up from the airport. So do have the full address as the cab driver from the airport could not find the place for ages. Rooms are spacious but dated. The Hi Fi internet did not work- i changed hotels because of that plus the lift was not working. In addition to that u dont get much choice for breakfast and had to stay mainly in the room. The hotel has a day driver - quick and street smart- that helped. Near the tube/ metro. Draby place with no frills but reflects the price, you should not pay more than 1200 to 1500 rupees including all taxes as abt 500 more takes u into a different class in the same vicinity.Suggest you book for a day and than extend your stay if you like the place. "
indraprastha hotel ,"really a great staff! Everything it's ok. Room, bathroom, the staff. Good place and good people. They help you with a smile on their faces. "
indraprastha hotel ,"Nice central location - great staff! The airport pickup guy had to wait 2 hours for our late plane - no problem, he was there and we connected easily (this was at 2am in the morning!). The middle of the night arrival at the hotel (we came from the U.S) was a bit of a shock, but it turned out to be perfectly ok. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location is right within easy walking distance to all kinds of shopping as well as to the (excellent) subway station. (subway costs 8 roepies one way). The only (sort of) complaint is that there was a bit of noise up until about 11pm. The clean rooms did not provide top sheets on the bed (we did not care as we carried our own). The food at the roof top restaurant is marginal (we only tried breakfast), but there is an excellent restaurant within walking distance on the same road (called &quot;Tempting&quot;).This hotel also arranged a car for us to return to the airport (750 roepies). All worked out great! For a day auto rickshaw drive for around $20, we would highly recommend Bill, phone [--]. He is quite trustrworthy and will show you a great time! Tell him, Dutch recommended him! "
indraprastha hotel ,"A lot of history but a tough crowd I came back from a one week trip to New Delhi and surrounding areas. We stayed in a budget hotel called Indraprastha at Karol Bagh. Its situated on Tank Road nestled between Ajmal Khan Road and Gurdwara Road. Right next to it is the Bengal Sweet Center. The hotel is decent. I travelled with my whole family (wife, 2 kids and mom). We stayed in a double room with extra bed. A/c room. The room size was not big but given our family size I have no complains. The hotel is generally clean and the management in general helpful. They have a 24hr travel desk and offer airport pickup for a fee. For Rs 1740+12.5% tax it was a decent deal (inclusive of Rs 350 for the extra bed and including breakfast which was not that great and served by a very serious guy) . Karol Bagh is quite central and the hotel is right next to Ajmal Khan road with can be a shoppers delight. Plenty of restaurants around. Their website is [--]Don't go by the pictures in their website for room size. My double room had a single queen size bedOf the big indian cities I have visited, Delhi seems to be the cleanest, seems to have the best roads. Drivers also seem to follow traffic rules in general within the inner city and also seem to be mindful of the omnipresent traffic cops. People sitting in the front seats have to compulsorily wear seat belts.The people in general here are tough. Plenty of street arguments especially traffic related. They don't seem to smile much and they have a very in-different attitude to providing service. I'm told that people here are very status conscious and money matters a lot. Although I didn't take a auto-rickshaw I heard they are a rip-off. Delhi has a lot of historical sites. For the kids there is Zoo, Appu Ghar, Doll Museum etc. Although I didn't try it, there is also a boat trip along the lake next to the old fort. The most impressive of the places for me was the red fort for all its history and fall from grandeur.I visited Haridwar/Hrishikesh/Agra/Mathura/Brindavan. Very impressed with the roads/highways. Concrete and the trafiic moves very smoothly. 100kms is vey do-able.I stayed overnight at Haridwar at Ganga Azure near the railway station and in the market. Not bad. Again clean and reasonably spacious for the prize. Rs 1500 for 5 (incld kids) for one night inclusive of taxes. The Har ki Pauri (Ganges) is a decent walk from here although there are plenty of rickshaws for Rs 15/-. The restaurant at the hotel is pretty Ok. "

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Old and tired won't be staying there again! We arrived and checked in at the hotel late after a delicious meal at Bukhara. Our first impression of the hotel upon arrival was it was dark (poorly lit) and looked old. Nonetheless, the check-in staff were efficient and friendly. When we told them that we won't make the breakfast room's opening hours, as we were planning to be on the road to Agra at first light, they kindly offered to pack us some breakfast for the road, which was generously portioned.However, we found the rooms damp, old and tired, and not particularly clean either. It is definitely not the usual standards expected from previous stays in Intercontinental hotels worldwide. We booked a non-smoking room / floor, but our room stank of stale smoke, probably entered the room through the air vents.Thankfully, we were out of there first thing in the morning. We're fairly certain we will never return to this hotel again. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Great Business Hotel Stayed here for work &amp; didnt get the best room at first. I had a bad cough &amp; the old room I got smelled of damp &amp; old smoke (even though it no longer was a smoking room). What impressed me most was the response I got when I complained. They were kind enough to show me 5-6 different rooms of which I could have my choice. Then (I can only assume to apologise) I found a chocolate cake in my room the next day!The rooms I chose was a newly renovated room which was a smoking room. But it was really brand new &amp; so there was no smoke smell whatsoever. The newly renovated rooms are much nicer than the tired old rooms &amp; I would recommend asking for one if possible.The facilities at the hotel are excellent. Great pool, good restaurants &amp; the spa/sauna/gym are is excellent. I also have to highly rate the people in the business centre. Very helpful, friendly &amp; unlike some hotels I have stayed in, have no problems giving you a quick photocopy without charging your room for it. Internet speeds were also good.Location of the hotel could be better for sight seeing, but for business it is great. Its closer to Noida, across for Nehru place (a large IT market where you can get any IT needs services including plan copies, scanning etc sone) and still not far into Connaught.All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel based on value. Our rooms were much cheaper than all of the other 5 star alternatives. Sure some of the old rooms have a bit of a damp issue, but as the renovation continues I think it will become an even better value hotel. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"DONT STAY AT INTERCONTINENTAL EROS -DELHI DONT STAY AT INTERCONTINENTAL EROS -DELHII would like to express my anger concerning my stay at the InterContinental Eros-Hotel in Delhi.My visit was just awful. As I was with my family I opted to book a suite. When I arrived I was given a room not over looking Lotus temple as promised, but given a stingy damp room. When I requested for room change I was told there are no other rooms available. The corridors were full of smell and dust because of repair work. We were left without electricity for an hour and when only I went to reception they sent a person to repair it. The wash basin was choked and bathroom smelly.What is more interesting that no points were added to my priority club gold account and I was told that I had bought on reduced price, but it is nothing like that . After all these blunders they just offered a discount. I didnot know that this discount are my priorty club points.Because of this I had to change the hotel and opt for Le Meridien Delhi.

I was a bit worried about the mixed reviews I read on here about the IC Nehru Place. but was pleasantly suprised!!Check in was quick and efficent and was taken to our room. As an Ambassador member of IC membership scheme, we were upgraded to an Exec suite. The room was amazing!!! Big in size, the best amenites, two bathrooms, giant fruit basket, fresh flowers everyday. The room was perfect!!!Make sure your rate includes breakfast, as its well woth it. The breakfast spread was a mix of cultures, Indian, English, American etc etc, which kept all the family happy! There was always plenty there and waiting staff to answer any questions.I didnt have time to use the gym or pool so cant grade them, but did use the business centre to check in onto next flight. Internet access and printing was fairly cheap, and the staff were extremly helpful.Location wise, its on a quite busy street but you cant hear the traffic, there are a few eating places near by (turn left when you leave the main car park gates), and felt quite safe in and around the hotel.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here, the polite and helpful staff made the stay at the hotel even more enjoyable.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"This hotel is my home from home in Delhi I have been staying at this hotel for 4 years now. It's never too full of non-Indian tourists which I always find encouraging - the locals often come to the restaurants to each which I see as a plus point. They are starting a renovation process, they are promising a much better hotel - I just hope it doesn't lose it's Delhi charm.I have stayed in other Delhi hotels for comparison and while not as super-delux as some, it can still proudly call itself a 5-star hotel. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Great business hotel I stayed at IC-Nehru Place a few times on business. It is an excellent business hotel with a convenient location with easy access to domestic airport as well as to Noida. Rooms are a bit outdated with stained carpets but they make it up with good amenities and space. The rooms are larger than the other IC in the city. The selection of drinks in the lounge is quite good. As a PC-gold member, I also got a complimentary 15-min neck massage treatment - a very unique way of rewarding the loyal customers beyond the usual free welcome drinks that are generally offered elsewhere. The breakfast spread is extremely good though a bit expensive if it is not already included in the room rate. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Old tired - not even a Holiday Inn let alone an InterContinental The word &quot;InterContinental&quot; conjures up images of luxury and service. Not so at Nehru Place. First of all, despite an e-mail request, no airport transfer was waiting for me. When mentioning this at the reception, the clerk simply blamed me, without actually looking into the matter. Only after providing proof, they sort-of said they were sorry. Great start, especially arriving at 11.30 PM.My rate included breakfast, but since I had to leave before breakfast started, I requested whether room service would be available. Again, the clerk said no, no and no. Only the duty manager could reluctantly be persuaded to be core courteous. So after over half an hour of haggling at check-in (and a harrowing taxi ride from the airport), I was finally able to retreat to my room. What an abysmal display. Clearly not up to any standards (see pics), and bathroom wasn't even clean. Carpet was stained, furniture was worn, lamps falling of the wall, and the room was just way too old. This, dear readers, is NOT an InterContinental. "

I believe they have one of the two heated swimming pools in all of Delhi with oberoi being the other.Nice restaurents and a lavish breakfast buffet at the coffee shop.All in all a pleasing, business friendly hotel.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Needful Renovation If Nehru Place is not too far away from the centre for one's needs, this is currently a good-value five star experience - on balance. The staff are excellent, and breakfast is good. Wrap up warmly for dinner, though, the a/c in Blooms Restaurant is set to maximum chill in the evening. The hotel is currently (June 09) undergoing renovation, and the noise of this travels through the structure from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 7/7. The fixtures in the rooms are showing their age, and the renovation is timely: bathrooms are looking rather tired, the water pressure varies considerably (making a shower an exciting experience); and in one of the rooms I used the curtains did not meet in the middle and, despite several reminders, the management seemed unwilling or unable to remedy this. It should be easy to negotiate a good deal - I got complimentary airport transfers and 24hr internet, whereas both are normally charged for at Delhi prices on the standard rack rate. "

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Efficient and convenient I have been staying at the Intercontinental Eros, Nehru Place, Delhi once in a few months since 2006. It is very close to my Delhi office and I find it very convenient to stay. The property is a typical city hotel - large and impersonal (which is good when you are on business!). The staff are very courteous and the rooms are spic and span. They are one of the few hotels which provide all toileteries including shaving kit and toothbrush and toothpaste - a welcome convenience for frequent business travellers like me. Occasionally I have had trouble with the irons in the rooms, but nothing which the staff haven't solved promptly.Their restaurants are good and provide a decent variety. The coffee shop does a good breakfast spread and one can take a quick bite or have a luxurious breakfast depending on what one wants. The Singh Sahib does excellent north Indian food and the bar is very relaxing place. That is, except when the live music is on in the bar. If you want to just relax and nurse a drink after a long, hard day, the live music isn't something that helps. They have a good sized swimming pool located on the back side next to the lawns, well away from the hustle bustle of the hotel.The business centre is small but efficient. Some rooms have views of the Lotus Temple.A place I would recommend for the business traveller but may not be ideal for tourists. "

intercontinental eros nehru place ,My First Bad Intercontinental Experience I am a Intercontinental groupie but this was a poor experience. The hotel is tired inside and out and in a second class location. The Club Lounge was well below my expectation and the rooms are old-fashioned. And to top it all very poor handling on check-out of an overcharge on my account....real obstinacy that I have never experienced anywhere before let alone at an Intercontinental. There are much better Delhi hotels including the Lalit which was Intercontinental until recently!! Come on Intercontinental...get it sorted 
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"A Quaint Room with the Biggest Kingsize Bed You Can Imagine! We live in New Delhi, but chose to take a 24 Hour &quot;escape&quot; in town. If you know anything about Delhi, you would never think of Nehru Place as a get-away place! It is reminicent of a run-down Westworld from the Yul Brynner 1973 film. The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Mission control was the room itself. A huge bed made for comfortable sleeping and a playing surface for some family games. Definitely request a room on one of the top floors. The view out the huge windows bypasses the built up commercial areas and looks onto a green patch of Delhi. One can see the Lotus Temple in the distance.The breakfast is well worth eating. The huge fruit bar, cereals, and juices were great.The swimming pool was freezing but refreshing. Don't expect any privacy though, as half the floors look right down on you.There is now a cineplex 2 minutes walk from the hotel and some fast food joints for those who want to get out, but not waste time getting there.As for all 5-Star hotels in Delhi, the price is not worth it unless someone else is paying. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Great Experience at Eros Intercontinental The hotel looked drab from outside and the mall in the lower floors seemed depressingly empty but the inside is a different story. It is richly decorated even if it is a little dated.This hotel oozes with the professionalism of older hotel chains. Service was not perfect in that we had to follow up on a few things but it's evident that the staff aims to satisfy its guests.The breakfast buffet served food of the highest quality featuring local and international cuisine.The gym was busy in the morning with serious health buffs so that tells you the equipment is good. The staff in the gym actively helped guests while they were working out.Amenities in the room abound, perfect for people like me who can't resist taking those bottles of shampoo and conditioner home with me.Additionally, there's a market across the street in which everything from electronics to used clothes are sold. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Great Place in Delhi The InterContinental Nehru Place in Delhi is a very welcome place away from the hustle and bustle of the city.The hotel itself is located in the south-east of the city, about a 25 minute drive from the centre. Taxis are very cheap, however if you want a bit of luxury, the hotel offers reasonable prices for half day and full day rates for their cars and drivers, which are the Honda City, the Toyota Camry or the Audi A4.The hotel also has one of the best Indian restaurants I have had the pleasure to eat in called the Singh Sahib, which offers good Punjabi fare and also has great live music. There is also a good Chinese and a cafe style restaurant too.The pool is outdoors and a bit of a dissappointment along with a fairlly small gym which is next to a spa offering various treatments.The Executive Club floor (or package) is worth going for as there is a plentiful supply of tea, coffee and chocoaltes all day long and a nice breakfast and snacks later on. The Club lounge also offers fantastic views from a rooftop balcony overlooking both sides of the hotel including one over the nearby Lotus Temple. The Executive package also offered free return transfers to the airport, which is a godsend in Delhi and more than makes up for the price difference. The downside of the lounge is the provision of internet access that must be paid for, so you may as well hook up in the room on a laptop which offers more privacy.All in all, a good stay with friendly staff and good size rooms and bathrooms.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Sheer Bliss My family and I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Nehru Place. As I give close attention to reviews from Trip Advisor, I was a bit concerned about the value of this stay. My concerns were alleviated, however, over the course of our time at Nehru Place. We found the Nehru Place to be exceptional. We stayed in two club rooms which were extremely comfortable. The club room included a soft bed (felt almost like a water-bed) with comforter, a spacious bathroom, an outstanding view of the Lotus Temple, and top of the line bathroom amenities. We also had access to the Club Lounge which was the best Club lounge I have been to in India-highlights of the lounge included great food with pleasant views of the city. The lobby of the hotel is gorgeous while the hotel restaurants are top of the line (we ate dinner at the Indian restaurant which included great food and live music). What set this hotel apart from the rest was our experience with the concierge who went out of his way to help us with future travel plans to Agra and to find a hotel package suitable to our needs and budget. The one shortcoming of our stay was check-in. I believe that the Nehru Place could grow by improving its Club Room check-in. We highly recommend Nehru place (especially with a Club Room) to anyone looking to experience five star luxury at a great value in Delhi. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Disappointing... Anyone who has experienced Indian 5 star hotels comes to expect a lot in terms of quality of the hotel and service. In that light, this hotel is a disappointment. It is stuck in time 15 years ago in more ways than one. The carpets smell musty, the decor is jaded, the rooms are ordinary, the staff seems bored and even the supposed traditional Indian welcome seems contrived....The breakfast is the standard buffet you can expect in such a hotel. No surprises or shocks. Yes the location is very convenient to check out Delhi. If you are lucky you can get a room with a view to the Lotus temple which is a beautiful structure. But at the price it is a rip off. There are other hotels around with similar or better offerings at a significantly lower price. If you must stay in an Intercontinental chain hotel then the Crowne Plaza in Gurgaon is a far better property. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Perfect stay at InterContinental A wonderful place to stay that has thought through every apsect of a stay and has taken care of every detail.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Great Business Hotel I've come to expect a certain level of service at Intercontinental hotels around the world, and the Nehru Palace doesn't disappoint. The hotel is well maintained, the staff is very professional and is eager to help, and the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable (you can even select one of many styles of pillow you want). The 24-hour fitness facility is well equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, stairmasters and a variety of weight machines (There is also a spa and yoga/aerobics service, but I did not use either).As people have stated earlier, the breakfast buffet is fantastic. The same restaurant also serves a lunch and dinner buffet, which is quite nice. For transportation, the hotel does offer a driver service for pick-up and drop-off at the airport for about Rs.2,200. The driver will meet you in the arrivals hall, and the drive to the hotel is about 40-60 minutes depending on traffic.Overall a delightful experience. I hope to stay here again on future visits to New Delhi. "

The pool and outside are quite nice as well. The buffet breakfast is a vacation in its own right. There is a few Western, Asian, and Indian breakfast. This buffet is one of the top five buffets I have ever had. The location is good as well. It is located very close to the famous Lotus Temple within walking distance actually. It is also located across from a mall with a decent selection of restruants. The hotel operates a taxi hire service where you can hire a taxi to take you around the city in an old ambassador car. This is very reasonably priced and the best way to get around the city. "

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Noisy - lots of traffice noise/car alarms etc My company booked this hotel for me. I checked in and asked for a quiet room. they gave me room 708 and it was very noisy as the hotel is surrounded on all sides by busy streets full - just normal delhi traffic such as constant horn blowing, two stroke engines etc and then add in the car parks and car alarms plus thin windows and it is a noisy experience. I spoke to the staff about a quieter room and all the rooms are the same as they are all exposed to the outside roads. I stayed at this hotel for a total of 3 hours and couldn't stand it anymore and changed hotels.The room was small and tired looking and also smelt pretty bad.I checked out and there were no surprises on the bill so they charged Inr12,000 plus 1,625 luxury tax and the internet was 800 + 100 VAT + service tax 99 so the total bill Inr14,623 or US$365 for three hours.

There are several parts to the buffet with salads, hot food, desserts, cheeses etc. There is always two sections which change each week... one where it is different hot food cooked on the spot ie: chinese, pasta, seafood etc and another where it is a cold food prepared on the spot like sushi.There is always a chocolate fountain on the dessert table which is delicious.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"good hotel but serious management problems I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last few years and have reviewed it in the past.The good things are still good - excellent restaurants, friendly staff etc.But when I got home I found that my credit card had been charged TWICE for my stay. I settled my bill in full when I left, and that charge was on my statement. But an identical charge was ALSO on my statement, dated a few days later. So the hotel double-charged me. I have asked my assistant to sort this out with the hotel but surely the hotel should make sure that this doesn't happen in the first place. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"A fantastic hotel with major problems This is such a fantastic 5 star hotel. So beautiful and sparkling clean with fantastic service and food. The Spa and gym is great and they have a beautiful outdoor pool. If you do not have a reason to be closer to the city this is a good choice. However my problems started on the InterContinental Reservation line. I spoke to a friendly woman who quoted me a price for a Club Room and I booked my reservation. I was soon contacted and told that she made a mistake and no price existed for the Club Room Category. I let them know that was not my fault and that they should still honor the quoted price. They eventually did and a division of InterContinental Hotels ended up picking up the tab for the 3,000 rupee difference. That was only my first problem. I was there for a special occasion and soon found that the room above was having major construction. We had to listen to pounding and jackhammers for 3 days. I became very from what had to be the hotel food and had to extend my stay by 1 night. I was contacted 4 times by phone by different front desk emplyees to let me know that I would be paying a much higher rate for the extra night. In addition, I receieved a note under my door and the duty manager called to be sure that I knew this. It was excessive and not very good timing given my stomach illness. The last straw was when I shut the dressing room closet and the glass shelf of the bar collapsed (the bolt fell out of the wall) and the entire shelf and contents of the mini bar shattered on and around me feet. This was not only inconvenient by dangerous. I called and house keeping was sent to clean the mess but I was never contacted by anyone else to check as to my condition after the misahap. Upon checkout they tried to charge me for the broken bottles though I had made sure that the Manager knew of the situation. Any problems that you may encounter in this hotel are brushed over. They want to pretend that everything is perfect when in fact it is not. They also tried to charge me for a much higher rate and I had to insist that the Duty Manager get involved. Forget trying to get access to t he GM as they will not allow it. This hotel has big problems. It is a shame as it is so gorgeous. The service in the restaurants and the room attendants is fantastic. It is just the management and front desk personnel that are a problem. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Good choice in Delhi in ~$US200 range My wife and I stayed a couple nights at the Intercontinental Nehru Place after wrapping-up a one-month trip in Rajasthan. Delhi is expensive, and hotels are often poor value. This hotel is not cheap (around $230 after taxes), but it's a plush, comfortable, quiet hotel that is good value for Delhi. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"more problems than solutions i stay there only one night, but to use wireless in the hotel not possible, when i did the check out they forget to charge me some phone calls, so i advise than about it, we lost about 20minutes to find the phone calls, and they charge me some calls not completed.I advise about the problem but the guy don't do nothing. i hope next time stay in other place more thurst.

intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Fantastic hotel sheer decadence. Clean, tidy and polite staff, from the bell boy to the duty manager nothing was too much. I would stay here again without question. India is expensive currently as there is a shortage of good quality hotel rooms. This hotel costs a similar amount to some much poorer properties in New Delhi perhaps 20% more but worth the investment "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Fabulous hotel with outstanding service This hotel was fantastic! From the moment I arrived, I was treated like royalty. The staff even knew my name. Anything I wanted, they were more than happy to help with. The room was large and comfortable. The bed and bedding were luxurious, and they provided a pillow menu if you wanted a different type of pillow. The room had all of the essentials you would need if you did not have your luggage—the desk had an adapter plug, tape, stapler, staples, ruler, etc., they gave me a clean robe and slippers every day, there was even an emergency flashlight, a daily tray of apples, complimentary bottled water, toothbrush and toothpaste, razor…and more. It was a wonderful experience. The towels were so soft, and if you have been in India a while you will really appreciate the hot water, great shower, and actual bathtub. My room was cleaned quite well. I was given a smoking room because I arrived close to midnight, but when they called the next morning to see when I wanted to change rooms, I said I would just stay because the room was fine and did not even smell like smoke. I left my camera n the lobby and the staff found it and brought it to me. I purchased a sari, but mentioned to one of the girls in the lobby that I did not know how to put it on, so she came up to my room with me and showed me how to wrap a sari! They were all so warm and welcoming. For a woman traveling alone, that is important. The food from the “coffee shop” was also outstanding. I ate almost all Indian food and it was great, plus the service was excellent. I will definitely want to stay at this hotel again. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"A star performer Superb! Came here from the awful Ashok and it was like a different world. Superb staff, clean and efficient, great restaurants. Not quite so central but you always use taxi anyway and it is a price worth paying for this real quality.Would come again to experience the sheer delight of such a great hotel. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Avoid bad experience I was on a 2 week business trip to India and was looking forward to my stay here as all the other hotels I have stayed in here have been excellent. However, this place has some major problems. All sorts of issues that add up to an irritating and unsatisfactory experience. First, I booked a non smoking room. When I went to check in there were no non smoking rooms available and they told me that I could have a smoking room and change tomorrow. When I book something normally it's booked - right? I didn't expect to book something and find it was not really booked. I got the impression there was a big conference that had block booked some rooms, and my one person stay was not too important to them. The room they put me in is above an intersection of 3 streets and as anyone knows who has been to India, on the streets they honk their car horns constantly. This would not have been a problem if the windows closed properly in the room, but they seem to be screwed in place, with some of the screws coming loose, with the effect that some of the windows don't open or close properly and the effect is that the car horn noise comes into the room constantly. The room is OK but pretty shabby. The front control panel is missing from the television. The bathroom does not look particularly clean. Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect. I was under the impression that having put me in a smoking room I didn't want when I arrived, that someone was going to call me the day after I arrived, to let me know when I was switching rooms - nothing happened. It is the service here that is really lacking. I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in (the ITC Sheraton &amp; Towers in Chennai), but the service here is poor by the normally high Indian standards. They have this system where you dial &quot;9&quot; for any requests, this links you their &quot;Instant Help Center&quot;. This is a good idea in principle, but the people who answer the phone have such a very poor grasp of English that it can be an irritating experience. I called &quot;9&quot; to ask they why I had not been contacted about changing rooms. They answered the phone with the words &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained the situation, long pause on the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained again, long pause at the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;. You get the picture, you might as well talk to the cat. Instant, but not exactly help. I finally said, &quot;you can't understand anything I'm saying - can you?&quot;, they then said &quot;one moment sir&quot;, pause for 2 minutes of &quot;hold music&quot;. The receptionist was then out on the phone and gave me the impression that they had no intentions of contacting me about my room change, it was kind of up to me to remind them. Not impressive. I also asked them why it was 2pm and my room had not been cleaned. They said there must have been a &quot;DND&quot; notice on the room when the cleaner was there. Why do people in a customer care role use meaningless jargon when dealing with the public? I finally figured out that DND meant &quot;do not disturb&quot;. True - there was a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; notice on my room at 8am, but I'd kinda hoped that between 8am and 2pm a cleaner might have returned. The concierge service was a similarly disappointing experience. I went down there this morning and got some information about a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. The guy gave me some information and I said I'd think about it and come back later. About 4 hours later I went back to the concierge desk and it was unmanned. I waited, and waited and waited. Around 10 minutes went by, with receptionist staff at my side (sometimes not even serving customers) simply ignoring me. I finally got hold of one of the receptionists to try to see where the concierge was and they got hold of somebody. I thought this guy was also a concierge, but it turned out it was just someone they got hold of, he didn't have much of a clue how to help me, but said the concierge would call me by four. Four came and went and I called the ever useful &quot;9&quot; number and asked to be put through to the concierge, long pause again, the receptionist answered and stated that the concierge still was not around, but he would call me in 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later I gave upon getting a phone call and went down to the concierge desk and found him myself. The electricity here also seems to drop out for around 5 seconds, I was sitting in the bath last night and the lights went out. Each time the lights have gone out they have come back on again, but I fear they may not one time. Also a note for all us Americans and Western Europeans who are used to smoking being banned in enclosed public spaces. Word of warning - it is not here, and worse, there is little or no sign-posting to indicate where you can smoke and where you cant. I was having a coffee and a pastry in the coffee area just off reception (where the service was very unresponsive and slow) when I was engulfed in tobacco fumes. This is a pretty horrible experience when you are not used to it. I would not recommend this place, they seem complacent and don't seem to care about their customers. The ITC Sheraton's I have stayed in here have much cleaner rooms and their service standard are excellent. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Treated like royalty! Stayed at this property twice, and had a fabulous stay both times. On our first stay, we arived after midnight, yet it seemed that the entire staff came out to greet us in a receiving line. We were presented with a wrapped gift (a photobook of India) and whisked up to our room, an 1100 sq ft suite. The suite was full of fruit platters, cookies, and flower arrangements, including a 3 foot tall arrangement in the bedroom. The suite was immaculate, and rollaway beds were made up for the children. Both bathrooms were supplied with every imaginable amenity, and the bed was heavenly. On Xmas morning stockings were left on our door, filled with cookies and candies for the kids and miniature liquor bottles for the adults. Service in the breakfast restaurant was extremely attentive, yet unobtrusive, and the staff presented us with more gifts. The club lounge is very comfortable, with very nice attentive staff, and excellent snacks (tandoori shrimp, samosas, sushi, veggies, cheeses, etc., etc.); the only tiny minus is that due to liquor laws, children are not allowed in the club lounge when alcohol is being served. The restaurant Singha Sahib was truly amazing; much, much better than the acclaimed Bukhara at the Sheraton. Upon departure, the restaurant staff packed us a huge complementary lunch to eat on our voyage to Agra. Simply a perfect stay, and we truly felt like royalty. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"They charged me twice The front desk at this hotel is terrible. They don't know what they are doing. I booked thru Orbitz and my reservation was fully paid for before I arrived. I even brought the receipts with me. When I went to check out, they said that they didn't receive my payment from Orbitz yet. I showed them my receipt and told them to call orbitz. They insisted on taking my credit card. I was very reluctant to give it to them and finally when a manager assured me that a hotel like the Intercontinental would not double charge, I finally gave in. Well I checked my bill today, and they charged me for the reservation. I am so annoyed. I spent my entire evening trying to straighten this out. It is a complete waste of time. I hate this hotel right now. Do Not Stay Here. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Beautiful hotel but pricey facilities This hotel is beautiful and opulent, as you would expect of a hotel of this price range and class. We stayed here in January 2007 for a couple of nights at either end of a golden triangle tour. The rooms are lovely, furnished well and with a super bathroom (see uploaded photos). My parent’s room did smell of smoke but they were given a non-smoking room when they asked to change so no problem there. The bed was definitely the highlight- it was like sinking in to a cloud! We slept wonderfully. Unfortunately with a hotel of this price the facilities of the hotel were also very expensive, to the point of being unreasonable (in our opinion). An hour of internet was priced at 600 Rs (7 GBP) and when we had to make two urgent 10 minute STD calls to Chennai (south India) from the room we were shocked upon checkout to be charged 2700 Rs for this (over 30 GBP). We were also told at checkout rather abruptly that we had to pay for our breakfast! So we then had to insist that they check the booking and that breakfast was indeed included in our rate. This was a bit of a pain, and the reception staff were quite difficult, but they did eventually concede their mistake once they had checked the booking. Overall, a beautiful hotel with gorgeous beds, but careful they don’t con you on all the extras unless your company is picking up the bill! "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Better than Imperial IMO. We did not choose this hotel because booking on its own would've been out of our budget. However, we were fast-talked into some Golden Triangle package, and when we did the math, there was significant savings on the nightly rate for this place. We stayed at this hotel on the last leg of the package, which was our next-to-last night in India. I did not care for India in general, but for those who wish to go there (or return), I would recommend this place. To me, it made up for the hassles and substandard facilities that I had to endure prior to checking into the IC. I found this place far more impressive than the Imperial (where I stayed the majority of the time in Dehli), albeit without its history. It's a nice business-class hotel, and I thought it was tourist-friendly as well, although most other guests there were on business. I am very picky and am used to American standards in hotels, but I was still fairly impressed. No problems in check-in/out, professionally handled. I don't recall any problems with the room. I loved the public areas and the lovely bakery. I didn't have a chance to use the pool. I worked out in the ladies' gym. My only problem was that the jacuzzi was slimy inside. Ew. So I didn't use it. Although the gym was fine, I've used better spa facilities, but still overall the place was better than anywhere else I could've afforded to stay (didn't try the Oberoi). "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"loved the service I stayed at intercontinetal in december 2006. Check in was easy, staff very friendly. Food in the restaurant was delecious with lot to choose from in the buffett.Rooms are nice and clean and beds are made twice a day and staff is always wanting to go extra mile to help the customers. I will definitely stay here on my next visit to delhi.Only drawback is distance from the international airport which is about 45-60 minutes drive. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"A great experience My husband and I stayed at this hotel in October for 5 nights and found it to be excellent. We had a package for our whole trip to Delhi/Agra and everything went like clockwork. The tour operators (Go India Tours) collected us from the airport and took us to the hotel - arriving at about 3.00am to a warm welcome and to find our hotel room ready for us. We had a delightful room, quite large and with a king sized bed, and spacious marble bathroom. Whenever we requested a car during our stay, one was available instantly. Perhaps this is the answer to the previous critic - order a car on demand!The breakfast buffet choices were extensive, and every taste was catered for. We had dinner at the Sing Sahib restaurant and the lamb shanks were really divine! I totally recommend them. We went to dinner at the famous Imperial Hotel for lunch one day, and on one night ate at their Spice Route Restaurant. The restaurant was just mangnificant, but unfortunately the food not good at all. The food was much better at the InterContinental.The only problem with our room was the plumbing in the bathroom was a bit noisy, and the water did not drain away when showering. We did not advise them about this - we just did not get around to it, so we really should not complain.Our trip to Agra was fantastic - our tour company collected us from the hotel and physically put us in our first class train seats. We were met in Agra and had a wonderful day checking out the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort. Everything went to plan and we had a terrific day.The Business Centre is very good, but they do charge you for internet use. It was not very expensive.All in all, a very nice 5 star hotel and we would definately stay here again. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Nice Hotel frustrating experience with the Staff We booked at this luxury hotel, hoping for a relaxing weekend in Delhi.Before arriving at the hotel I called two days ahead and requested that a driver pick us up from the airport. I provided my arrival time, and the hotel said he would be there with a placard with our names and a hotel sign. On our arrival, we spend about 15 minutes looking for our driver. A helpful airport employee called the Hotel &amp; put us in touch with the front desk. The Hotel stated that they didn't have any flight or arrival information so couldn't send a car. I provided this information days earlier, and was verbally told everything was in order. We waited another 30 minutes for another driver to pick us up, and of course were charged for it.I had also made a call to the Hotel to line up a driver for a day trip to Agra &amp; the Taj Mahal. The concierge on the phone quoted us a price which I agreed to, and he confirmed we would have a driver Saturday morning at 7am and a tour guide for the Taj. He told us that we could pay at the concierge desk when we arrived. The first night we arrived at the hotel, we stopped by the concierge desk to pay. They said they couldn't find any information on our tour request! We started from scratch &amp; booked a tour that night. Fortunately a driver picked us up the next day &amp; we had a great day trip. This was the second major lapse by the staff.Our room was nice, clean and elegant. One of the main problems on our floor (5th), is that they must have just re-varnished all the woodwork on that floor. The fumes were overwhelming to the point of nausea. Luckily our room wasn't too bad.The meals were good at the restaurants, they had an ATM close by, and the facilities including the spa were very nice.The final day we had another communicaton breakdown. We had requested a driver at 12noon the last day to take us to the airport. When we checked out, no one had any idea about a driver. Luckily the bell captain made a call and we had one shortly.With the premium price of this 5-star hotel, we were very disapointed with our service. Our three attempts to line up transportation were either lost or forgotten requiring us to double &amp; triple check all of our arrangements. Not something I would expect from even a three-star hotel. We'll be staying elsewhere on our next trip.Marc - USA "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Fabulous facilities good rooms Was in Delhi for an extended time over the summer and decided to splurge for a weekend. First was showed to a room facing the street--our request for a view of the Lotus Temple and the pool in the back was granted; however, not without delays. The wrong set of keys were sent up and when the right set came they got stuck in the door for some time. The lady who showed us the room was obviously flustered and the bellboy tried to be helpful. Staff are desperately in need of some training. Finally, got it open after 15 minutes waiting outside our room. One other thing, a constant alarm in the adjacent stairwell was buzzing for a few hours in the middle of the night; called operator twice until it stopped. Other than these episodes, rooms were clean; comfy beds; massage and spa were great. Great big and clean pool. For the price and quality of facilities, I would stay here again over the Imperial Hotel. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Getting even better I stayed at this hotel about a year ago and had loved its location as I had found that it was close to most of areas I had planned to visit. It was a good experience then, the staff was friendly, the services easily comparable to any other five star in Asia and pretty good value for money. This year due to sheer convenience I once again stayed there. Though the hotel's standard services are still the same one expects from every 5 star hotel, it was the little things they did that made time there so great. Tired from the flight it was a sheer delight to see that I was met at the door and taken directly to the door of my room, baffled I even asked don't I need to check in ? and the answer with a smile was Sir, you are being checked in. Little things like that continued, people always ready to attend to you everywhere. Another thing was if you did actually need something, all you had to do was press one button and the operator did the rest, no matter what you needed... no more dialling different nos. for your diff. needs. Thank God! I tried their chinese restaurant this time...I was thrilled by the authentic cuisine put together by an actual chef from East Asia.All in all, this place is only getting better, I am already looking forward to my experience when I stay there during my next visit. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Sorry sir we don't know you I stayed at this hotel on a business trip, and arrived in the early hours of the morning to be greeted at the front desk with &quot;You don't have a reservation&quot;. Evidently the office at the hotel taking bookings doesn't always make the reservation in the system. Then, for a later stay, I made a reservation at the front desk when I arrived for my first stay, only to be told later (but only when I checked at the end of that first stay) that they didn't have rooms available except on standby basis. Why not tell me this up-front? Or did they not actually make the reservation when asked? The front desk staff need a better attitude to customer service, and to actually do what they say they will do.The rooms are good, and clean: I've stayed in both the Club rooms and one of the Suites. The pillow menu is a nice touch, as is the choice in the room of both feather and synthetic pillows.I never did get the Internet access in the rooms to work, but didn't have time to mess around with their business centre.Another minor irritation was the insistence the doorman made on taking cases away from you on arrival, only to abandon them in the lobby for a period of time. The customer should be given a choice about being parted from luggage or not. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Luxury Home Away from our Home Me and my Family were more than pleased to be met at the main porch right at the Taxi. The man with a professional conversation took us to the Lobby and we with a small break we were taken to our room. I was really tired and wanted to keep away from the normal formality.During the stay when I came back one evening, the Manager at the reception with red tie offered me a complimentary juice and welcomed me back home. What would a tired man of the day wants.Restaurants were clean and the staff was lovely.Rooms were old but well maintained.There is noice travelling from outside. Internet is of good speed.Staff overall is just great. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Trying Hard Stayed for 3 days. Room service- excellent. Some reception staff very cool,some get very stressed. One person didnt have a clue and treated us , as if we were staying in her home for free. 24 hour restaurant -you can still see flies allover. music too loud for conversation. "
intercontinental eros nehru place ,"Imperfect but good. The restaurants were great. We had 2 rooms for 3 days during an off-peak season. Our price was quite good (6580 Rupees plus tax).The only substantial problem we had was the air conditioning didn't work in one of our rooms. Partial air conditioning was restored within 12 hours, but in the heat of summer, you'd expect a top hotel to apologize profusely, refund your room or offer another room, or something similar. The thermostats and climate control systems were old, but most of the hotel facilities had been updated. The beds, linens, and pillows were very good.The restaurants were extremely good, the menus were interesting, and the wait staff were able to predict some of our special requests. They handled small children well, but the meal wasn't any faster when we explained we were in a hurry. The restaurant prices were high (120 plus tax for a bottle of lesser-brand mineral water) but comparable to other restaurants in top hotels.The business center staff were helpful for establishing internet connections (which wasn't trivial.) Much of the service was quite attentive to detail, such as when the hotel porters put the suitcase on the luggage stand and put the briefcase on the desk, instead of dumpingeverything by the bed.I agree that the front desk staff was not good. They were too easily overtaxed by their regular job duties and they were brusque about handling special requests. Even though they weren't dealing with other customers when I was there, they seemed to feel overstressed and frazzled. There were some other little things that weren't quite perfect. For example, there was a pianist playing in he lobby, but the piano was terribly out of tune. But just the fact that there was a live musician in the lobby tells you that there is a tremendous effortto provide a luxury experience. As one would expect I found this hotel to be far superior to the Metropolitan Hotel Nikko. "

itc maurya new delhi ,"banging all night Having just got back from delhi and staying in different hotels in delhi { imperial,bristol and raddison} we decided to have a night at the ITC maurya new delhi. the room was so cramp it was the worst room out of all the others we stayed in. there must be better rooms for hotel like this one, some work started in the early hours in our next room and there was banging all night we didnt sleep a wink, tried to phone to reception got no answer and it cost nearly double than all the other hotels. the dublin bar was ok thats all. never again will i stay there staff was ok but didnt offer us a apology, it was the last night of our holiday and the worst.while we was thererecommended to stay looking back on the holiday i cant understand why i didnt complain "
itc maurya new delhi ,"ITC - ND One of the nicest hotels. Excellent partys, lots of young people, the only place u can eat good food 24/7 "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Nice Digs in New Delhi After traveling for 7 weeks around the world my babysitter and children voted this their favorite hotel. We stayed in tower suites and I am not sure how those rooms compare to other rooms in the hotel. We had two rooms and they were identical. The mosaic shower, large bathtub, nice sized room and attentive service were mentioned as favorites. Everyone loved the coffee, tea and hot chocolate that was served before bedtime and as part of the wake up call. The large outside pool was perfect for an afternoon reprieve from the August Indian heat.The executive floor was nice but not nearly as spectacular from food availability as other executive floors around the world. The nightly offerings for snacks could have been better, but the atmosphere was sophiticated and stylish. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs had plenty of tasty offerings and the staff made sure that if anyone wanted or needed anything their desires were satisfied. The hotel security appears to be high because of other events in the country. It is impossible to get into the hotel without having your car checked and luggage x-rayed and body searched. One never knows how safe you can be if someone wants to do something, but it appears that the property takes security matters seriously.The only downside to the hotel is the large number of AA and Finnair flight crews do monopolize the business center computers periodically during the day. In the future I plan on staying at the ITC Maurya in New Delhi. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Unbeatable Service My father and I stayed here together last month. We always stay at the Maurya when in Delhi. We'd asked for a room with twin beds and when we arrived and saw the room, it felt a little cramped. When we asked the guest service manager if he could do something about it, he immediately upgraded us to a wonderful deluxe room, which felt big enough to be a suite. The only issue was that it only had a double bed, but with separate duvets, it wasn't a problem. I ate several meals at the hotel. The Bukhara is an old tradition of mine and yes, while it may be sometimes erratic in quality, I still love it. My standard order is the leg of lamb, daal and naan. I still love the place. The coffee shop has an excellent spread for breakfast, can't complain about anything there. They have all the usual congees, bacon and eggs as well as the indian specialities, which I love to eat when in India. The lunch buffet, the day I ate there, was during a Keralan special day and they had a lot of South Indian specialities. In order to save time, I just asked the waiter to bring all six dishes to my table, which they kindly did. My Humble House - their Chinese restaurant, was just OK by my opinion. We had dinner there and I've had better. But I generally don't like Indian Chinese restaurants. West View - now this is an interesting place. You go thorough a whole slew of dishes from sea food to meat. Again, while the quality is good, I generally prefer local food while in Delhi. Golf Bar - regular bar with a golfing theme. Had Lembu Paani, fresh lime with sugar and salt, delicious.Dublin - Excellent bar. This hotel had a complimentary happy hour from 6 to 8 pm!! Seriously! Ok the whiskey is red label rather than black, but if you have the vodka they'll serve the Smirnoff, which will suffice. Four vodka martinis and dinner is so much better! My only negatives: a) the internet in the room's pretty expensive, yes it is free in the business centre, but I want to use it in the room. b) in an amazingly perfect room, there was a power outlet that must have been recently installed and it was shockingly not level. Normally I wouldn't notice it, but everything else in the room was perfect. c) The bathroom was fully stocked with excellent toiletries, but replenishment wasn't uniform. All items were not replenished daily. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"ok but overpriced i stayed at this hotel, booked from the internet, all though december is high season .The rooms are large and comes with all mod cons of five star hotel. my check in was quick as being a gold member of starwood hotels. staff were lot friendly and always knew my name .internet was free and so was breakfast come with room rates.

itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent Hotel with Excellent Food. Hotel rooms are very well decorated, very clean and trendy. Food at the main restaurant was really outstanding.

itc maurya new delhi ,"Space for improvements Just returned from my jurney in India. I had two seperate stays at Maurya and my general impression is that there is some space for improvements left. It might be that some thinks changed due to recession but failures which shouldn't happened includes:-wake up call automated service didn't work properly, that's why afterthat I requested personal wake up call which was either late for 15 minutes and provided again with automated service. From that point I missed an important meeting that day.-Housekeeping department should be focused on small things, placed in room, not to be missed. There should't be discrepance on ameneties in separete rooms.-They advertise Executive lounge but one is not in funcion. Having drinks in basement in Dublin at 6PM is realy not an unforgatable experience, although Dublin itself is nice. As I am Platinum I was offered having drinks in Tower lounge, but again very limited service.-Temperature at Delhi is too hot to spend a couple of hours near the pool, but having service available in order to buy yourself some drinks would be a nice gasture.-Confirmed Pick up service at railway station failed, concierge told me that they sent a car, but we will never know if we really missed each other or not.I personally expected (based on experience of other collegues) upgrade to ITC One based on my status - but this is completelly my fault. But after changing the room where I was woken up due to mainanace (which is a good part as wake up call didn't work again) It would be unwritten rule to treat a guest at least with a fruit platter or bottle of wine in order to say that you are sorry. If not upgrading at that time.Generaly don't get impression that this is the worst property, but as I said there is a room for improvement. Personally I will pick up another location next time. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Top Delhi Hotel Located very close to the International Airport, this 5 star hotel is located in the green diplomatic enclave. However there is still some distance to go to the centre of the city and all the sights.The service and the rooms are of excellent quality and certainly as expected fo any 5 star hotel in the world. Staff do try and do as much as they can to help and are prompt in their service. The rooms are very clean, modern, well featured and above all very comfortable. The hotel has most features you would expect like a swimming pool and spa and has numerous top notch restaurants.The only drawback could be that the hotel is expensive given the local cost of living.

Molton Brown bath products a nice touch of luxury+ Great restaurant selection and food, although expensive (especially the alcohol)+ Very nice spa ... one of the best massages that I've had in a long timeNow, the reasons why I would NOT recommend this hotel:- Front desk ... non-smoking room that I reserved was &quot;given away&quot; to another guest. Guy at check-in took 15 minutes to figure out what to do with me, and I could hear him telling the manager that my rate didn't quality for a better room ... not very professional- Restaurant ... breakfast can be extremely busy and the staff does not deal with the chaos well.

There was rich variety in food - plenty to choose from (Buffet at coffee shop, Bukhara, Drinks at the club etc) 5. Prompt room service6. Very helpful staff - (for instance, they never showed me directions but actually led me to the place)Truly delightful experience overall - would love to return.. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Best hotel for dining out in North India The Maurya has the best selection of North Indian food. The hospitality is great - you are in a special world right from the time that the doorman greets you. I love the lobby - one can conduct a full-fledged business meeting right there. The rooms are lovely and the offers like the trip to the Taj Mahal are really well thought-through. I also like the shopping arena in the hotel which is open at unearthly hours for the last-minute shopper. The attention to detail in the restaurants is wonderful - it is easy to make friends among the lovely staff. 
itc maurya new delhi ,Expected More Stayed for a night and honestly was left a tad bit disappointed. It was alright. The food in the chinese was exp and ok. The room was big but didn't care much for it. Wouldn't return

itc maurya new delhi ,"All you can ask for in a Starwood Hotel only 15 mins from airport The ITC Maurya has all the facilities (gym, pool, spa) that you will need to feel comfortable. Rooms were very clean with excellent attention to detail. Business center offered free internet use. Internet in rooms was expensive but inline with other 5-star western hotels. Food in hotel is excellent. The restaurants here are well known and local wealthy Indians dine and party here. Bars are supposedly well known but I didn't go to any of them. Pool is nice and you can swim laps. Gym is excellent and the spa looks great as well.The only problem I had was that some of the staff weren't as friendly and helpful to my wife and I because we were not business folks, but travellers dressed in casual clothes and sandals. The travel desk wasn't particularly helpful when we needed to get a train and they told us that they'd call the bus station for a bus schedule but they never did.The only other thing I was annoyed of is that the hotel taxis will try to tout you. They don't like to make one way trips so they will try to tout you and ask you if they can stay and wait for you at your destination. Often times, it's just cheaper to walk onto the street and grab and auto rickshaw. "

itc maurya new delhi ,"Great Hotel with a Class of its own Its a very good hotel to stay with I liked it as its half way from Airport and the CP. The hotel has a class of its own with very modern looks of rooms, the staff is very prompt, the service is very good and every minute details is taken care off when you stay with them. Has very good choice of food with very good Indian style restaurant. In general its a worth stay I had, good rooms, prompt service, very good food and a great place all equipped to have a business deal "
itc maurya new delhi ,Fantastic Stay I am frequent traveler to Delhi and had the opportunity to stay at this iconic hotel. The rooms are fantastic. the re-done bathrooms with clean lines are nice. the modern looks make it truly on par with any other 5 star hotel room across the world.The food is expensive ( no surprises there huh ?) but they do have good room service and I was also offered free breakfast for some strange reason. :-)

itc maurya new delhi ,Loved the Ambience The hotel ambience is fantastic. The room was good and I really enjoyed the spread of the breakfast buffett. It was an overnight stay for me and I really liked everything about the hospitality which the hotel provided. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Not that good The experience at Maurya was bad to say the least.It looked like a cheap hotel which hasn't been maintained for ages. The food was pretty good but overall the place was bad.The cleanliness was not upto the mark.On the positives, apart from the food, the location was good. It is an ideal place in Delhi.To the readers, my views may look a bit biased but overall it was not a great place to stay. "

itc maurya new delhi ,"Loved 'My Humble House' Maurya, in many respects, is ahead of the times. It hosts one of India's first discotheques. Service is speedy, efficient &amp; courteous. Food at all the restaurants is great.- My Humble House is extremely quaint and dainty. Terrific coffee at the bar. Great location. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent hotel - would go back again and again Having stayed in many of Delhi's five star hotels, I thought I would try the Maurya as I got a very good rate. I was not disappointed, especially as I was upgraded to the Towers (the club wing). The room admittedly was not as big as for example the Oberoi, but big enough and very modern. Best feature was the rain shower in the bathroom, beautifully tiled. The Towers has its own breakfast room, which was quiet and lovely, with waiter service and classical music. The Chinese restaurant and 24-hour restaurant were also excellent. The two Indian restaurants are great but really over-priced and a bit pretentious. The gym/spa has recently been re-done and is gorgeous; however the spa rates are astronomical so I didn't go for any treatments. Hotel staff were always professional and helpful, without being obseqious and hungry for tips as they are in some Delhi hotels. All in all, I would definitely come back to the Maurya. My only real complaint is the location, which is a little bit out of the way - but only a little bit. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Fantastic property One of the best properties have stayed in - food, room service, location, ambience etc. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Hospitality at it best Having stayed in couple of excellent hotels in &amp; out of India, at first i did not expect any thing different from Maurya when i did my first booking for a business trip to Delhi.But as soon as you enter the huge central Pavilion from front porch (where reception desk is located) , you can't stop looking at bright lighting ,lots of brass &amp; Gold finish elevator doors.Once inside your room, your dream walk to luxury continues with sparking clean interiors, 32 inches LCD TV, cozy bed &amp; variety of fruits &amp; snacks available at your disposable.To cut it short, if you haven't stayed at Maurya still, you have been missing true luxury at it best !!!!!

itc maurya new delhi ,A Conference with delicious food It was offical conference organised by my organisation which included introduction to PDMS etc. It was a full day conference with deligates from wide variety of industries. I had a very delicious indian food. Overall Wonderful day's stay at sheraton. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"All about Bukhara and Dum Pukth The hotel was classy and the service was excellent. the highlight, of course, was the food at Bukhara and Dum Pukth. Seems like ITC Maurya is 'the' hangout of celebrities and VVIPs in New Delhi. The only disappointed was an extra bed that we had asked for, which collapsed in the middle of the night while we were sleeping. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Business Travel - Stay at Sheraton Murya I like Starwood properties around the world so I decided to stay at the Sheraton Murya Hotel in New Delhi.As a Platinum member of the Starwood Preferred Guest programme, I was upgraded to a suite room which was very spacious and had all the amenities.Check-in is always in the same style as other Starwood properties where staff greet their guests with warmth and in style that reflects all Starwood Hotels. I selected my usual 500 Starpoints welcome amenity which helps build up my points for future redemptions.One thing that I love about this hotel is its fine Indian dining at the Bukhara Restaurant. It is probably the best Indian food I have ever eaten and it is high recommended. Try the kebabs and all the tandoori dishes. You will be so full at the end that you will not feel like eating for a few days.In India, the food spread is so large that there is never an end to eating. I love the food there and if you are foodie like I am, you will surely enjoy this hotel.All in all, I highly recommended hotel for business travellers and not to mention for the foodie. "
itc maurya new delhi ,An evening at Bukhara Bukhara is a world known restaurant for its aromatic and delicious food. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Business Hang out My husband has stayed at the Maurya Sheraton more than 25 times and I have accompanied him a few. the architecture, Interiors and Rooms are beautifully designed. The Hotel is meant for the creme de la creme, but the beautiful mural dome in the lobby witnesses hundreds of business meetings,people who just come here to have a meeting and then move on! The beauty salon is good as is the famous restaurant 'Bukhara,' with its Daal Bukhara. Breakfast at he Coffee shop is OK. What is good, is that complaints are dealt with efficiently, but at this price, they better be! "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Wish I could give it more than 5 Stars...... This is the first time I am staying at the Maurya &amp; I am overwhelmed. Firstly &amp; most importantly by their service. If the hallmark of a fine hotel is to make you feel welcome and at a home away from home the Maurya Sheraton excels in fulfilling this perquisite by a mile.Every member of the staff is helpful, kind, compassionate &amp; cheerful. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome &amp; comfortable. I just requested housekeeping for a firmer mattress for my back problem &amp; the A. Manager of Housekeeping Mr. Kishore Kumar personally landed up to make sure that I was satisfied &amp; comfortable with the arrangements.The rooms are large spacious and well done up. They are certainly better than the ones in the Taj Mansingh &amp; the Oberois. The spa is fantastic &amp; so is the swimming pool.Last but not the least is the amazing food that one can savor in the Maurya. The Dum Pukht &amp; Bukhara are easily two of the finest restaurants for Indian cuisine in Delhi. Even the in room dining at the Maurya is one the finest I have ever experienced.The warm service, fine dining &amp; comfortable accommodation are only some of the reasons why I would love to give the Maurya Sheraton more than 5 stars &amp; strongly recommend it to my fellow travelers on Trip Advisor. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Loved the Restaurant Bukara An awesome Mughal Experience... This is what I call Dining in Style... The food tastes so delicious here at this restaurant that people should be careful not to eat their own fingers!! 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent location - excellent service spent 3 nights there while on a wedding ceremony in Delhi &amp; Kathmandu. Staff is professional and very keen to help you. Many nice details, i.e. room staff can see from outside if room is occupied, there is european plug on the desk, no need for adapters! food is excellent, though we only had breakfast from the huge buffet and one dinner - all other nighs we were out of the hotel.Only criticism: Lobby is too cold and so is the restaurant. If you sit close to an AC outlet you have to wear winter clothes. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Loved the ambience I just have three words to say for this hotel.. Excellent, Fabulous and Magnificent.. Amazing food in Bukhara restaurant. I just love its speciality - Dal Bukhara. Very good brand shops are also available in the hotel for shopping. It is one of the poshest restaurant of New Delhi. Most of the foreign country ministries stays there during their visit to India. Hotel is landmark of luxury. And honestly speaking, one cannot raise a finger against their service. Its ambience has copious alluring content. I am also fully gratified by their serivce. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Outstanding and Palatial I have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past several months and its service and quality of rooms seems to impress me more on each visit.The attention to detail in each room is perfect. Nothing is there that does not work, and everything you need is in place from the get go - including the simplest need of an iron and board.The room rate may be high, the restaurants on the expensive side, but the hotel does not overcharge for items such as the internet or the laundry (compared to other 5+ star hotels around the world).The service is impeccable and totally reliable - pleasant and courteous staff go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one.

itc maurya new delhi ,Loved It It is one of the most comforting hotes with nice rooms and excellent food. It always nice to come and visit the hotel 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent Dining Options On check-in they directed me to a club room which was stinking of cigar smoke. On complaining they shifted me to a non-smoking room, but it was not a club room. I didn't argue with the front desk as the room was comfortable enough. The whole check-in process delayed my schedule by nearly an hour. The room was well-equipped with all amenites. The restaurants in this hotel are excellent. Ate one night at My Humble House, which is part of the Tung Lok Group, which have many award winning restaraunts in Singapore and Taipei. Great ambience and superb food, but frightfully expensive. A more reasonable option is the West View Grill which had an impressive Grill Buffet, with excellent variety of seafood and meats, besides a decent salad bar. I would probably stay here again purely for the dining options, as this hotel also houses the famed Bukhara and Dum Pukt restaraunts, the best known Indian restaraunts in India. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great weddin I had gone to maurya to attend a family function. I must say its d best hotel Ive visisted so far. The ambience was awesome, the food sumptuous..the decor was great.. services were prompt..A very nice experience indeed..I loved the cold coffe with ice cream there :) "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Bukhara is the best! The hotel needs no introduction as it has hosted some of the most world famous dignitarties including Bill Clinton. The massage chair, the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, the music system are my favourites and hence I enjoyed staying here several times in the last 5 years.I would recommend the ITC One rooms as they are an experience in themselves.I also enjoyed the food at Bukhara and entertaining a few clients there for business has provded helpful.The staff, one of the best!You can also enjoy the world class piano by Brian Sylas here. He is too good on the piano and his fingers seems to have some magic. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent- The Maurya Excellent personalised services. Food is of the highest qualtiy. Excellent restaurants- The Bhukara is the best in India. Good loyalty program, the Welcomaward. Happy hours, at the Towers lounge is worth mentioning as excellent. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"At ITC Maurya For the business traveler to Delhi, it is the perfect hotel. Conveniently located, good facilities, nice food. The hotel upgraded me - I was glad. The upgraded room was wonderful. I particularly liked the massage chair in the room and the music system - enjoyed listening to Delhi FM channels in the morning while getting ready :-)The size of the property is something that you cannot miss - and that too in the middle of the city.I like the hotel's relative closeness to the airport.Would certainly recommend this for your next Delhi visit. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Great Food This is one hotel property i love to go to time and again. Also a great place to go to with friends or business guests for the food at Buhkara. Recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the great food at Mauyra. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Luxury hotel famous for its food The Maurya is a grand hotel. I have stayed there a number of times in different room types. In all cases I found the rooms to be very well outfitted, spacious and ideal for the business traveler or the tourist. The charges are steep in comparison to other hotels however you can see why once you have stayed there. The service is very good and they are eager to take care of your every request. The highlight of the Maurya are its two restaurants The Bukhara and Dum Pukht. Both serve different but unique kinds of Indian cuisine however beware the food is not easily digested by those that have not earned it. A good workout before or after a meal at one of these places is recommended. The Hotel is located near the posh diplomatic area of New Delhi and hence is in relatively verdant and peaceful surroundings. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Loved the ambience It was a wonderful experience &amp; started the moment the check-in formalities started. The front office staff were extremely courtious &amp; their 'namaste' welcome with their smiles takes out all your stress.The room was very well - just right temperature &amp; right lux for the retiring eyes after a stressful day. More importantly the Indianness in the ambience all around, shows the great heritage of India. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Excellent rooms All five star hotels in India are majestic and oversized - this is no exception. Great rooms in the main area - Platinum members, I would not take the upgrade to the ITC tower, rather ask for it in the main tower; newer and larger rooms. Only drawback is constant problems with internet access.Bhukara and Dhum Pukt are v. expensive but excellent restaurants. Bfast is average. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"A busy hotel! I love returning to Delhi and always find it a challenge to find a suitable hotel, with good value and location. On a business trip in end Sep-Oct 2008, I had to stay in The Murya for multiple reasons. One thing during my entire stay remained a constant and that was the matchless South-Asian hospitality that began with the chauffer-drive from Delhi airport (DEL) and then on to a warm traditional welcome in the hotel lobby, check-in and right thru to the check out that included a goodbye present and a voucher to use the ITC lounge at DEL. . Not to miss out on the excellent service provided by the concierge, breakfast buffet &amp; beauty salon staff! Apart from some general information issues when approaching staff (maybe because a lot interns are probably working on some shifts) my stay remained hassle-free. Upon first impressions one is quite impressed by the dominating and eye-catching mural painted by renowned Krishen Khanna on the domed-ceiling of the lobby. However the rest of the interiors are a bit dated except from a few upgraded floors. I stayed in an Executive Floor room which I assume was their entry level room. Had no issues with it except that it was a bit on smallish side for a week’s stay. Comfort as promised by Starwood properties with a choice of pillows that boggles your senses. Good room service and great breakfast. Although I find the two restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht over priced and overrated. Although the food is great! And how can I forget the Sticky Date pudding with butter scotch sauce at the Dublin Bar. Interestingly enough when I had a mid-night raving for the same, the room service staff made sure that although it was not available on the room service menu in the early morning hours arrange it for me...now that is service!I had a smooth one-week long stay with a truly amazing culinary experience including a breakfast to look forward to and a very friendly beauty salon. In fact I shopped from the little arcade- something I avoid doing at large hotels but I could simply not resist.The only down-side if on a holiday is the crowded lobby as some airline crew stay there and the hotel also hosts many conferences, seminars as well as receives dignities from around the world. Otherwise contrary to some reviews that consider it over-rated to be in the Luxury Collection of Starwood properties, it is a good hotel mainly because of its level of service. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"A good stay for the business traveler Stayed here one night for business in the Towers section of the hotel. Room was nice with all the amenities. Tried to book a round of golf in the few hours we had through the concierge and were told that one course was booked and the other was closed. Enjoyed the Dublin Bar happy hour with co-workers from 6-8 PM. They kept on serving free onion rings, chicken fingers and nuts. Also, my co-workers and myself were not charged for any of the drinks. Never got the final word on that, but did happy hour mean free drinks from 6-8PM? Lastly, had dinner at Bukhara and have to say it was well worth it. Everyone will tell you this is where the Clinton's ate when they visited the hotel and if I remember correclty they even have some type of &quot;Clinton&quot; special. I would reccomend reservations because my group had to wait about 30 minutes on a weeknight at around 8:00 PM (after happy hour of course). My biggest complaint was the gym, if you want to call it that. They must have been renovating because it was a handful of cardio machines and a tiny amount of dumbells crammed into what looked like a renovated hotel room. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great Hotel in Delhi Somewhat expensive but excellent stay in this hotel. Spacious rooms, great amenities. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Good but not too great The rooms at this hotel were great. I only had trouble with check-in and service in general. I had booked 2 rooms but when I arrived at the hotel, only 1 of them was ready. We had to wait for about an hour before the other room was ready. Most of the staff were literally salivating for tips. They all greet you hypocritically hoping that you'll drop a tip in their direction.I think it would be better to stay at the Sheraton in Saket which is cheaper as well as newer. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"great place wonderful hotel. stayed in a towers room which was a little small but the quality of the room and elec toys made up for it. massive flat screen tv. great hotel overall, good choice of restaurants, make sure you visit the Bukhara Restaurant, amazing food. Overall kind of expensive place to stay but most 5 * in Delhi are "
itc maurya new delhi ,"v-e-r-y disappointed. What I hate more than anything is looking at photos on a travel site and on arrival the room looks NOTHING like that.I was excited to stay at the &quot;best hotel in Delhi&quot;, I had three nights booked.Things didn't start well on my arrival to the Maurya, the hotel had some visiting dignitary and made your arrival seem like it was an inconvenience. Plus, having a pat down and your bags x-rayed and searched as you entered the hotel wasn't comforting.........yes, I'm whining, but I don't do it often, so please forgive me.After requesting a &quot;non-smoking room&quot;, I was put in a smoking room, I returned back down to the reception and after a long wait and a death stare, finally I was put in a non-smoking room.Other negatives:The gym was under construction, so a small room was made into a temporary gym room. Don't bother putting your do not disturb sign on your door, coz it was ignored on m-a-n-y occasions. Aghhhhh!Careful about the charges for a hotel taxi, and if you order your own through reception, ask for an AC car, otherwise they will automatically order a non-AC at the same cost.Some positives:The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the staff happy and helpful.The spa, the head massage was excellent!Bukhara restaurant, simply awesome.The pool yummy.This was my forth visit to India, my last to the Maurya.Sorry to be so negative.Penny "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Amazing luxury Hotel looks spectacular and seems to be a favourite of Delhi's rich and famous. I had a room in The Towers which I loved: large, with very tasteful decoration, a wonderful bed and a massage chair. Staff very friendly and efficient. Bukhara is a top-rated restaurant which you have to experience: tandoori eaten without cutlery. Afterwards I can recommended the laundry service that makes your shirt look better than new! My only complaint was a disputed bill from the taxi service: make sure they details their charges to you beforehand. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Solid performance Stayed at the Executive Level in a newly renovated room. Good size room with stable internet connection. Nice bathroom with a glass separation to the bedroom.Very nice touch by room assistant who added personal touch to housekeeping.Breakfast buffet (incl. in rate) offers good choice in Western and Indian food. One point I like about this hotel is that I do not have to hail a taxi and travel around to have my favorite meal downstairs at Bukhara. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"the preferred residence of visiting heads of state and global business leaders I had previous experience of this hotel, each marred by something really irritating and/or stupid (from trying to get toiletries delivered to the room, to discrimination in the bar). I have also stayed in most classes of rooms, from basic through to ITC One, and used all bars and restaurants at one time or another. So this wasn't a stab in the dark.My gmail account was blocked by the archimedian internet; some of our reservations were invisible at check-in (of course they were very clear at check-out!); food hygiene is not a priority here (giving support to my theory that it's the 'clean' places that do for you in India); though there often seems more staff than guests, getting staff to do anything is often impossible due to demarcation.As this is (“the preferred residence of visiting heads of state and global business leaders for over 25 years&quot;, it should be better. It probably is for that class of guest. But the hotel demonstrates little interest in others. The Maurya management should look to The Sonar (Kolkata) for guidance...On a positive note, the Towers Club staff are great, as are the Poolside staff; the renovated rooms are a great improvement, especially as the windows now fit... "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Good hotel but take out a mortgage if you use the Dublin bar. I stayed at the ITC Maurya a couple of times in May '08.The welcome was very good, as was the check in. The room was small but otherwise was very good indeed with a superb bathroom and walk in &quot;wetroom&quot; type shower. Being somewhat of a 'gadget nut', I was impressed by the amount of thought which must have gone into equipping, furnishing and decorating the rooms. The remote control for all the lights was a nice touch, as was the plasma tv. There is a separate floor which is exclusively for single female guests so they can feel more secure in their rooms.Breakfasts could be taken in a number of different locations in the hotel and all were excellent.The public areas in the hotel were in many cases, sumptuous. There is a very nice outdoor pool, a superbly equipped business lounge and an up-market shopping mall in the hotel itself.The only bad thing was the cost of eating and drinking at the hotel. The 'Dublin bar' was the obvious choice but even during 'happy hour' where drinks were half price, they were still eye-bulgingly expensive. After 8PM, you needed a second mortgage to be able to pay the bill!The other slight problem is that the hotel is not an easy walk from any other shops or restaurants although we did eat away from the hotel wherever possible.On stepping out from the hotel, I was invariably pestered by taxi drivers and 'tuc tuc' (motorised rickshaw) drivers. They did not seem to understand the concept of going for a walk and were typically agressive and pestering with their touting.All in all a superb hotel although expensive by any country's standards. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Expensive hotel but it was GREAT!!! Stayed for 1 night in the hotel for a recent business trip. As it was a last minute booking, I have no choice but to book directly from the hotel and was booked in a deluxe suite paying a hefty USD630 per night. Definitely the most expensive hotel I have stayed in!!!!! Then again hotels in India are never cheap which is a sharp contrast to the poverty scattered in the city.......very ironical indeedArrived late in the evening and did not really get to enjoy the hotel as I have to check out at 6:00 am the next morning without having to enjoy the breakfast. Check in was prompt and upon entering the room, was impressed with the size and the great comfort the room offers. There is a living room which is separated from the bedroom, the bathroom was spacious with the cabinet located in the bathroom. There are 2 LCDs TVs in the room which is a thoughtful gesture and was equipped with a good working table which is important for business traveller. Internet access was expensive though compared to other ASEAN hotels. The bed was comfortable and the nice gesture of having scented oil to soothe you for a relaxing rest in definitely well thought of. While I did not get to enjoy the breakfast,had dinner at the cafe with my agent and this buffet dinner is very expensive at more than USD60 per person. The spread is not very extensive compared tp what I see in Singapore and definitely not worth the price. Perhaps it was a Saturday, the dinner was more expensive. As we were lazy to venture out of the hotel for dinner and guess buffet is the only choice as we are undecided on what to have.....All I would say is that it's a wrong choice and would have tried other restaurants in the hotel given that there are many other options. The other negative feedback I had about the hotel was its extremely slow checkout and poor service rendered by the staff who has checked me extra for the amount which I have already paid in cash. If not because I was observant, I would have been charged twice. Furthermore, with the rates for deluxe suite, was told it would come with complimentary airport transfer during check in but was told this is not offered at checkout ....definitely another brickbat for the hotel..... "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great hotel Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of March. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable with supersoft pillows (my description, guests can choose from a choice of different pillows if they wish). I particularly liked the design of the shower in the bathroom. There was enough room for two armchairs in the room but I have stayed in larger rooms in hotels of a similar calibre. Breakfast was served upstairs and there was a good choice. We had two meals in the pavilion restaurant which were reasonable and one meal in the Dum Phukt which was disappointing. We hired a car (with driver, wouldn't dare drive in Delhi) and he took us to the various sites that we wished to visit and waited while we looked around. Quite expensive, but worth it for our first trip to Delhi. A lovely hotel. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Dubya stays here I went to New Delhi on a business trip and (although a very short stay) I enjoyed my time at the Maurya.There was a very nice pool area and I will be immitating their landscaping in my own backyard. I sat in the lobby waiting on an associate and really enjoyed the live piano player and his &quot;show tunes&quot; from the 30's and 40's.The Pavillion restaurant buffet was fantastic! I wish I had taken my camera so I could have gotten a shot of the desserts...an unbelievable array of decadence. I loved having my own personal French press for my coffee, too. Classy!One of the most renowned restaurants in New Delhi and the world is in the Maurya (I think it's called Bukhara) but I didn't get a chance to dine there.There is a wide array of shops in the hotel and I brought back several beautiful silk scarves for my wife. There were also gorgeous rugs which werre extremely reasonable and could be shipped back to the US. See my photo below.Dubya stays here when he comes to New Delhi...the US Embassy and other diplomatic facilities are just around the corner. The service was excellent and the room comfortable. When I get a chance to come back to India for a personal trip, I will definitely use the Maurya. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great Hotel in New Delhi Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks in September of 2007 for work. Room was not very large but sufficient for one person. The hotel staff was very nice and were very eagar to help. There are several restaurants in the hotel. Dublins is a Irish bar which turns into a club at night; a nice place to people watch but the food isn't terrific. Bukhara (which is one of the top restaurants in Asia) is a must for Indian cuisine. You can order their food up to your room or you can dine in. Dum Pukht is another restaurant which is you should dine in. The food was excellent but it is very bright inside the restaurant. I liked the Westview restaurant, you can pick out the food that you want and they will cook it right in front of you. The pool was nice, it wasn't very crowded and the water was warm at that time of year. I wouldn't recommend swimming at dusk because bats occasionally dive bomb the pool. I liked the hotel but it was isolated in the diplomatic enclave and you need a driver to take you around. It doesn't compare to a Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons but it's one of the nicest hotels in India. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Acceptable I stayed in this hotel from 1/13 to 1/22/08. I had stayed in the adjoining Sheraton Tower last year but I was not too impressed. This time I was in the main Maurya hotel. I had booked the room on the internet. Booking and checkin were very smooth. I was lead to a very spacious suite which was well decorated and clean. I had put in a request for a quiet room and it seems that they had payed attention to this request. Room was turned over twice a day. Bathroom/showers and closet areas were excellent. Breakfast buffet was included in the price [$450] and it was excellent with a great Indian/Western selection. I have only 2 minor quibbles. 1] The breakfat area got quite crowded and chaotic on occasion. 2] Some construction noises were occasionally heard. Overall I had an acceptable experience. The price is steep but that is standard for top hotels in Delhi. 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Wish US based Starwoods were this great First off, the Starwoods in India make a Platinum guest actually feel appreciated. I wish the US hotels could be as kind. We arrived late from a long set of international flights originating in the US and were quickly ushured to the Towers lobby for a more relaxed check in. Mints and candies were available on the desk and the Rajput unifoirmed doormen took care of our bags.The towers rooms are newly decorated with dark wood accents, an incredible curved mosaic shower, flat panel TVs, a touchscreen panel that controlled the lighting, DND, TV systems. There are bedside sleep aides includes earplugs, eye masks, lavender pillow spray. The hotel features two restaurants featured in the Thousand Things to Do Before You Die book. We tried Dum Puhkt and it was great but we were so sleepy we may not have fully appreciated it. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Awesome restaurant We had a room in the &quot;new&quot; wing (but not the top level), and the rooms were nicely decked out but a little small. A very short overnight stay so didn't get to enjoy most of the hotel's facilities.We did go back for dinner at Bukhara, and it was one of the best Indian meals we have ever had anywhere in the world. "
itc maurya new delhi ,Very nice (business) hotel Spend 2 nights in The Maurya in November.From outside the hotel does not look attractive.... but once you enter the lobby you realize this might be a very nice hotel...The lobby is very nice.Executive rooms were very nice (not very big though). Very well equipped and very clean.Staff was very friendly and helpfull.Main restaurant is very nice place to have lunch or dinner.Even the bar/pub is nice and happened to be a very popular place for the local youngsters.A nice business hotel ! 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great business hotel We stayed here twice each for one night during out stay in India. This really is a first class business hotel. I booked using Starwood points. My first room was very small and cramped but I was upgraded for my second room to a much larger room with a seating area and huge bathroom.We frequented both bars in the hotel. The Irish themed bar was dark and dingy but surprisingly appeared to be the more exclusive of the two bars. I preferred the golf bar which was just like any other business hotel bar to be honest.I found the concierge most helpful and they were able to track down an India cricket t-shirt for me and have it delivered to the hotel.The best part about this hotel however is the Bukhara tandoori restaurant. Voted one of the best restaurants in the world I ate there twice and on each occasion found the food to be incredible. Go for the raan of lamb, you will not regret it. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great room great service. We stayed here for a conference in Delhi and LOVED it. Our room was called a Garden View Deluxe suite and was actually the size of two hotel rooms (it seemed that on our floor, there were more of these &quot;double&quot; rooms than the regular rooms.&quot; The hotel was clean, luxurious, and hospitable. Rooms were modern (flat screen Plasma TVs), luxurious bedding, fantastic air conditioning, and were free from any odors even though smoking is common in hotel rooms in India. It is not perhaps five star by U.S. standards - but quite close. Some of our colleagues at the conference stayed at the Taj Palace and the Taj Mahal Mansingh. All agreed that the Sheraton actually had by far the nicest accommodations. Service was outstanding at all three hotels. If I had one complaint, it would be that the walls were a little thin. We could hear our neighbors a little and doors closing in the hallway woke us up a couple of times. However, it wasn't bad enough to really bother us at all. I would highly recommend this hotel. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great Hotel We had a great experience here. Wonderful, updated room with a great bathroom. This was definitely one of the best rooms we had in India. The buffet is also very good. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Bukhara restaurant is way over rated Although the hotel is OK (I wouldn't say world class), the restaurant Bukhara, is terrible.The tiny menu forces you to choose from the limited choices they provide. In addition, the waiters seem as if they have never waitered before, different ones coming to ask for a drinks order and a dessert order twice!In addition, I complained that their &quot;Rasmalai&quot; wasn't upto scratch and wasn't an original, the way the rest of India makes. The waiter argued that it was exactly as written and I had it wrong. He had the gall to stand there and argue with me...and didn't even take it off the bill, although we stopped eating it after the first bite.This restaurant is surviving on business travellers with nowhere else to go. Out in the real world of restaurants, their terrible service, average food and expensive prices would make sure they close down fast! "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Acceptable but not overwhelmingly impressive Previous reviewers have emphasized that the hotel seems to be overpriced, and with that I am in agreement. While you might expect the hotel to be more impressive, it is simply average by Western standards. However, having emphasized its mediocrity based on western standards, I am told by many that it is one of the best hotels in the city. Moreover, despite the prices, I had no complaints with the hotel.The room was clean with a very comfortable bed, service was acceptable, and breakfast buffet was serviceable. It is a short (20 minute) drive to the airport for approximately $20/hotel sedan and located in the diplomatic center of the city (i.e., near the foreign embassies). If traveling for Delhi for business you can do a lot worse. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great experience Stayed here for a week for business. I was told my room was upgraded at check-in. On the fire escape map, it did seem that my room (in Tower 1) was indeed a bit larger than others.My room entrance leads to a small hallway that opens to a bathroom and closet area. The bedroom is separate. The room is extremely spacious and modern. In fact, it's one of the nicest hotel rooms I've been in. There is a flat panel TV (37 in?) and several English cable channels were available (HBO, CNN, BBC, Bloomberg, Travel, National Geo, etc.)The breakfast buffet (included with room) is really good. Great selection (Indian and Western). It's hard to not find something suitable. I was afraid of getting stomach bug, but that never happened eating in the hotel.Service is excellent all around. There was a fruit plate in the room that's replenished daily. Chocolate is provided on some days. The linens and towels were always fresh and newish. The front door staff (in white traditional uniforms) were always cheerful and ready to help.Check-in was a bit chaotic. There were a lot of people working behind the counter, but one would pass me to another. Other customers were cutting in to speak to the employee who is in the process of working on my check-in. I'm used to a more systematic approach in other hotels.Only a few downsides: 1) my air-condition stopped working and had to lose an hour of sleep while someone fixed it. 2) Banging noise on the morning of my last day, which I intended for sleeping late to recover. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Not a 5 star hotel The room rate was nearly $500/night and, in my opinion, quite overpriced. I have stayed in hotels in Europe, the U.S., and other parts of Asia at that same room rate where the hotels were much more luxurious. My room was a standard room that had the look and finish of a standard room at a regular Double Tree Hotel. This hotel is not at all like other hotels in its price range, like the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. I would skip this one and stay at the Oberoi instead. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Sleepless night and not child friendly We booked through SPG and had the option of the Meriden or Sheraton. We chose Meriden for our first night and then Sheraton for the 2 separate stays we planned during our golden triangle tour.We are a family of 4, our children aged 6 yrs and 4yrs. We would describe ourselves as a well travelled family who have experienced some fantastic 5 star hotels across India and Asia .We were travelling back from Amritsar on a late train and phoned the hotel to arrange pick up at the train station. We were pleased to find the driver at the allocated spot holding a name card so he could be easily identified. He speedily packed all 4 suitcases in the car and got us to the hotel in quick time.On our first stay ( 1 night ) we had the unfortunate experience of being there at the same time as government officials were holding some sort of conference. So as you can imagine, after a 5 hour train journey we had to go through security checks before entering the hotel ( including my 6 year old and his cuddly dog).This was followed by us having to use the staff lift ( via the store rooms ) as the guest lift was not working for some reason.?? We had a newly refurbished room which could not be faulted in anyway. It was ultra modern and the kids loved it, even though it was close to 1am by the time we got in.The morning breakfast was to die for - as in most 5 star hotels in india, with an array of breakfast options for every taste.Unfortunately our second stay ( after our tour ) was not so great. We were checked into the 5 th floor in an old style room , below the restaurant ( which we later found out was being refurbished.)It was comfortable and we just did not have the energy to complain to be moved to a newly refurbished room so we made do.We booked a club room which meant we could have complimentary cocktails in the evening. We paid extra for this . We were VERY disappointed to find that the children could not go into the Dublin Bar, or in fact any of the bars that were serving the complimentary cocktails. What really upset us was that there was no mention of these restrictions when we booked. When challenged we were advised that it was government policy? That was strange we thought - the Meriden were tripping over them selves to serve the children snacks whilst we enjoyed cocktails?After some discussion with the duty manager they allowed us to go into the business club lounge and the children were served soft drinks , the snacks were disappointing too.What really became the final straw for us was on our last night we were disturbed at 11pm. 3am and 5am with what sounded like furniture being dragged across the floor in the restaurant above . We were told that it was being refurbished and hence the noise but they would put a stop to it. Despite our phonecalls down to the duty manager the noise would stop for a short while then wake us again, which did not help considering we were catching a flight the next morning.We complained to the duty manager when we came to check out and they did not charge us for the room that night - however they still charged nearly £70 worth of tax???The hotel whilst 5 star, modern and luxurious was definately not child friendly and is more for business people. We will not be staying there ever again. "
itc maurya new delhi ,recently renovated - liked it needed an extra night in delhi and the Hyatt staff booked me in here Great result - stayed on the refurbed 4 th Floor - The Bakhara restaurant is in the top 35 restaurants in the world - and superb the tandoor lamb is fantastic - Great room - nice environment - staff very helpful - would go back ! 
itc maurya new delhi ,"Staff I cannot relate to the reviews on this site saying the staff is not helpful! I found them to be just the opposite!We got into a bit of a pickle, as we were riding in a taxi to the hotel for our last night in India and realized that our passports were no longer in our possession. We were supposed to be leaving about 26 hours from that time, so needless to say, we were a bit panicked.The staff at the Maurya Sheraton were so incredibly helpful to us in our little crisis. The head of security at the hotel phoned his friend in the police department and he told us to go upstairs to our room and rest while he took on the burden himself of going over to the station with our written &amp; signed statements to get us the necessary police report to get the police report that would require us to get the exit visa at the Indian Tourism Bureau the following day. (Oh yeah! Not only are the passports themselves gone, but also the little stamp inside them that we must have in order to get OUT of the country!!) They went so above and beyond for us, advising us on the steps necessary to get our act together--1st, going to the US Embassy and then to the Indian Tourism Bureau......and we actually got it all taken care of and made it to the airport and onto our flight with our emergency 1-year passport and the exit visa stamp. Whew!I don't know what we would have done if the staff at the Maurya Sheraton hadn't been so helpful to us. Plus, we spent quite a while lounging around the lobby and it was very pretty with murals that remind me of Orozco or Diego Rivera in the lobby. The room was plush and comfortable. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel! "
itc maurya new delhi ,"The Lap of Luxury What a phenomenal hotel. I've traveled all over the world and rarely encountered such a great hotel experience. I had a room in the towers section that was beyond luxurious. The hotel staff was incomparable in terms of friendliness, efficiency and knowledge. The club lounge was spacious, beautifully decorated and had very attentive service. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous and enough to keep me going the entire day. The hotel fitness center was one of the best I've encountered. If you're going to Delhi, you won't be disappointed in the least by this wonderful hotel. And the mural in the lobby ceiling is just fantastic (not to mention the quality of the goods in the hotel shops). The hotel is close to the airport and not more than 15 minutes by auto rickshaw from the center of town and the railway station (convenient if you're taking a day trip to Agra). "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Great but expensive I was on business w/ friend; he has very expensive tastes. So i sort of had to stay hereAfter tax, my 1 night was $500. Ouch. Great room, nice interior, outside is sort of ugly, but who cares.Free breakfast (omlette...maybe best i've ever had)Only complaint is the $15 internet fee; miserly when you pay that much to get nickle and dimed. Plus my broke down (and i'm a computer guy)Otherwise, I'd never pay this much money, except i will note that after you see a parade of beggars and people living in the dirt, you don't mind spending money you have to sleep nicely.as ps, the nearby and related Le Meridian was about $80 cheaper. Just as good. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"OVERPRICED OVERRATED I booked this hotel on their website and stayed for 8 days in Jan. 07. The booking process was not without glitches ,probably because of the fact that I got a room in the Sheraton Tower, located in an annexe of the main Maurya hotel.At $450 a night,it was the most expensive hotel I had ever stayed in.I was desperate to get a room in a hotel in south Delhi and I had very little choice because of the lack of availability of more moderately priced hotels.Also, I had booked the hotel at the last moment(big mistake). Check in was smooth and I was led to a spacious business class room.The big negative about the room was that it was fairly noisy because of ? construction work which seemes to go thru the night.I made a couple of complaints to o avail.However, I was provided with ear plugs,which helped a bit.Also included in the price was a full breakfast at the tower club of the hotel.The breakfast spread was excllent, and I could also order an Indian breakfast,which was also excellent. I also had a meal at the famous Dum Pukht restaurant.On the basis of that experience,I would call it the most overpriced and overrated restaurant in the world.I spent $50 on a meal which I could have had at KFC for $5. On the whole my stay was OK.Most people would rate this hotel a notch or two below the top 5 star hotels inDelhi i.e Taj Mansingh road,Oberoi Mathura road and the Imperial.Would I stay there again?Iwould probably avoid it as it is just not good value for money.5 star hotels in Delhi are taking advantage of the room shortage during peak season.To repeat my earlier advise&quot;BOOK EARLY FOR A HOTEL ROOM IN DELHI.&quot; "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Maurya Sheraton-Just Superb... I had the pleasure of staying five nights through the New Year 2007. What can I say, the hotel is wonderful, truly a 5 Star hotel. As mentioned by someone earlier, the hotel has three separate divisions, the regular rooms, Tower rooms and the ITC One rooms. I had the opportunity to spend one night in the Towers and the rest in the ITC One rooms. If you can afford it ,ITC one is the way to go, but the Towers rooms were quite excellent also. The furnishings and fixtures are all that you expect from a five star hotel. I used SPG 50% off certificates (makes a big difference on a 5 night stay). Full buffet breakfast is also included, and if you are in the ITC One rooms, you can enjoy it in your room. too. The staff was wonderful and went out of their way to make us feel like royalty. Gautam at the Golf lounge and Arun at the Upper Crust (ITC One private lounge) were like my best friends, always attentive to my needs but unobtrusive at the same time. Because I had five nights, I could enjoy all of their restaurants (bit pricey) but definitely worth it. Bukhara is just superb. Arun would take care of all of my dinner reservations while I am enjoying complimentary evening appetizers and premium cocktails from 6-8 pm. The Spa/massage was wonderful too, $25 for 1 hour session, wow! This is truly a beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay here every time I am in Delhi. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Many small problems... mostly poor staff Stayed at this hotel for the 3rd time this year, this time for a week due to a conference at the hotel. This review must be prefaced by saying that most hotels in India don't come up to normal Asia standards for service and quality of staff... so lower your expectations before going!ROOMThe room I had - in the club tower - was nice and large enough. In previous stays I had substantial elevator noise, but not this time. Rooms were often not cleaned until very late in the day, and one day I had to call several times for service.GYMThe gym is very limited although there are 2 new life fitness elliptical machines and 3 life fitness treadmills - also new - since last time I was there. It's difficult to work out for a long time as there is almost no air conditioning in the gym.FOODMost of the meals for the week of the conference were catered by the hotel and they were OK for conference fare. The last evening, a number of people from our group went to Bukhara and 100% got sick.SERVICEThis is where the hotel really falls on its face. Checking in takes 20-30 minutes and it seems like the staff are doing it for the first time, every time. There is no record of my guest history from this hotel despite previous stays nor of my preferences recorded through Starwood, of which I'm a gold member. Checking out was not possible as I left early in the morning and the hotel seems to shut down their computers from about 4 am until 7 am. I had to email/call the hotel 6 times to get a copy of my invoice... took 3 weeks to get it, and only the General Manager was able to assist.What hotel is better in Delhi? I'm not sure, although the Taj is pretty consistent. I won't stay at the Sheraton again if I have a choice. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Pretty Average...! Over the last year, I've stayed at the Maurya Sheraton 5 or 6 times, last month being the most recent visit. The hotel is very consistent, but not quite what you'd expect from a Sheraton. The Hotel ItselfThe hotel is really three connected hotels - the Executive Tower (standard rooms), the Club Tower (nice), and the ITC One Club (very nice). Rooms in the executive tower are very small, and were noisy during my last visit due to construction, and even though management said that they would quiet down, they never did, and my room was changed twice before I found quiet.The Club Tower is nice and has an exceptional executive lounge with good service, nice snacks, and a very good breakfast. The ITC One Club is amazing - gorgeous (and spacious!) rooms, a private lounge, an in-room massage chair, and personal service is nice. The ITC One Club has a nice lounge with very good service - ask for Sandeep, one of the best waiters/bartenders in India.Checking in is a pain as all guests are first directed to the main desk, and those who have been upgraded are dragged to another check-in desk by an over-anxious bellhop. If the hotel knew what they were doing, they would have one check-in desk for all three....and not nearly as many bellhops.Food and BeverageThe Maurya is home to the top restaraunt in Delhi - Bhukara. Though the waitstaff there are terrible, the food completely makes up for it, and dinner is delightful. Be sure to befriend a bartender at the Polo Lounge or make reservations a week in advance if you want a shot at a table.The Dublin bar is fun, but they have trouble admitting they aren't a nightclub, and so they play very loud music. Try the homemade Bailey's...very good.The 24 hour cafe has good food, but the service is very slow.There are a number of other choices in the hotel, but these are the ones worth highlighting.Car RentalThe counter at the hotel, run by Travel House, provides pathetic service at sky-high prices. You're better off getting a car from a car rental company (like Avis or one of the local chains) than the hotel. I've had several drivers over the last 6 months, and they have all lacked knowledge about how to get around Delhi, insist on taking passengers to emporiums and tourist traps, and tend to have exceptionally poor english skills.SummaryOverall, this hotel is nice, but there are far better options for the price in Delhi. Try the Taj Palace next door or the Shangri-la near Connought Place for a better experience for a comparable price. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"Overall Solid Hotel This hotel was excellent in some areas and unsatisfactory in others. The service was impeccable. The hotel staff will cater to your every need. Most of the staff you will encounter speak English and are very polite. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. On the other hand, they are doing construction at the moment. It is incessant. Supposed to stop at 7pm, but that's not true. And that doesn't help when you're jetlagged and sleeping at odd times either. I moved to 3 different rooms in 3 days firstly due to the noise, then the bed being unbearable. Overall, a decently solid stay. Worth the money? Not sure about that. "
itc maurya new delhi ,"We liked it! In the winter of 2005-6, my wife and I stayed at the Maurya Sheraton on 3 separate occasions; twice in the Tower section, and once in the Club section. The Club was a bit cheaper ($275.00US) and we were lucky to get the newly renovated 12th floor. The first room we were given had the smell a freshly smoked cigar so we, being non-smokers requested and were given another room which was across the hall and had no odor. The room was on the small side, but very nicely appointed with great lighting which could be controlled from a panel next to the very comfortable king size bed, a huge flat screen TV with tons of channels and great sound, and a modern frosted glass bathroom. Room service was a bit problematic on this side of the hotel, and was very expensive. We had a tough time getting good indian chai! No excuse for that!The other times we were in the Towers section. It cost about US $325.00. The room was nice, bed was good, regular TV set. The bathroom had a mouldy odor coming from the drain, and although the staff tried, it could not be eliminated. There is no heat in the rooms, only air conditioning, but in January in New Delhi, it can get quite cold, and the room was a bit chilly. The best part of staying at the Towers is the butler service. Shortly after check-in, an immaculately groomed uniformed young man arrived at the door and introduced himself as our butler. Being regular Americans, we had no experience with butlers, but Chander took care of us in ways we had never known. He made the best tea we had in India, brought delicious juices, extra fancy shortcake cookies, helped our in-room meals, and offered to help with packing and anything else we might want! When my wife had a migrane headache, he made special ginger tea and gently put it by her bedside. It relieved her pain quickly, even after medications failed! He spoke very good English, and was interested and conversant without being overbearing and seemed to instictively know when to tend to us and when to leave us alone. All thee times we stayed at the Maurya Sheraton, we were promptly picked up at the airport in a new car with uniformed and polite drivers who drove the car nicely. The staff, while occasionally stiffly formal, did do their best to make our stay memorable and pleasant. "

jaypee siddharth ,"Great place to stay in Delhi near the center of the city This was my first trip to India I had no idea where to stay. The Jaypee Siddharth was selected by my business representative in Bangalore and my 4 night stay was a very good experience. The purpose of the trip was business and the desk and chair in the relatively spacious room on the third floor had good reception for the wireless internet connection. The internet connection is 400 INR per 24 hour period additional charge with unlimited sign on/signoff. The access speed was a very good, 54.0 Mbps.The location was good with a HDFC Bank with a 24 hour ATM 1/2 block to the east along the elevated metro line. One block to the west the Rajendra Place metro station is four stops from the Connaught Place metro stop which is one of the shopping districts. The pool seems to have had a recent upgrade and was a welcome surprise. I swim for exercise and stress relief and the pool is at least 20 meter maybe 25 meters long. Although it is not primarily a lap pool, the center rectangular section is wide enough for 4 lap swimmers. It was very clean even the morning after a torrential downpour and wind storm that knocked out power to parts of Delhi and flooded roads around the city.The restaurant in the lobby was the only one of the hotel restaurants I tried during my stay and had a very good breakfast buffet with Indian vegetarian dishes and fresh fruit selection. I have not eaten Indian food much and it is a bit spicy but I really like them. The dishes offered at the buffet were well prepared and there was excellent service from an attentive and friendly staff. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Decent Stay at the Jaypee We had to attend a wedding in Patelnagar, so we decided to book a 2 week stay at the Jaypee.We got a great deal online, Rs5250 per night, so this was perfect. The only other experience I have with hotels in Delhi, is from staying at the Maurya on our last trip, so I may not have the best idea of what Delhi hotels are like. If the Mauriya qualifies as a 5 star, I would give this place close to a 4 star (3.5 would probably fit the bill perfectly). Before giving my review, I would like to say that I would defiinitely stay here again, especially if I got the same rate. So here is my review:1. THE GOOD:-Small but elegant lobby, with a bar and restaurant attached. the restaurant and bar definitely give it a 5-star type of quality, very westernized. Drinks provided on check-in. -Lots of pretty ladies working behind the desk, overall a very kind, courteous, and accommodating staff.-High quality rooms, with hardwood floors. central a/c, plasma TVs, and marble bathrooms. Similar to the Maurya's standard rooms (without the nice carpeting).-Great bakery. lots of U.S. style cakes and pastries, and reasonably priced (also 1/2 price after 8pm).-Free Breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. Great food, excellent service. This place is open 24 hours, and has a great selection of Indian and western food. The even had steaks and cheeseburgers! Tasty French fries.-Awesome room service, we had amazing meals at 4am, since we were still on U.S. time when we first got there. Everything was freshly prepared. This was especially appreciated after a disappointing meal from the 'Bukhara' restaurant at the ITC Maurya Hotel (I'll write a review about that also, we wanted to go back after having a great meal there on our last visit when we stayed at the Maurya). -Great laundry service.-Excellent spa service (as per my wife, I never saw it).-Great beauty parlor for women-my wife used them to help her get ready for every even for the wedding (I think this was in the spa, I never saw it personally).-Free bottled water daily-this really helps, especially if you're from the U.S.2. THE BAD-Location: if you don't have family in the area, or you are not a businessperson working in the &quot;Karol Bagh&quot; area, you maybe disappointed, there weren't any attractions nearby. However, this hotel really is a perfect if you have family in the area (like I do), and if you're in the area to conduct business (the area seems to be a big business center with lots of offices and stores). -No slippers, no robes, and no alarm clocks (or any timepiece) in the room.-No ironing board or iron, you have to ask for these.-They won't let Domino's or Pizza Hut deliver to the hotel.-Rs 400/day for internet access-Comeonnn! they should've comped us with free internet, especially if we were staying there for 14 nights!3. THE UGLY-Quite a few days without hot water- The hotel seemed to be having a problem on my floor with the hot water. I will say they attempted to fix the problem several times, and sent up people to fix it quite quickly, but this was a recurring problem throughout our 2 week stay. Since it was quite hot in May, we didn't mind taking a luke-warm shower.-Although fully renovated, there were about 2 days with lots of banging and drilling above our room. It was in the afternoon only, but once again, we were on a reverse schedule for a few days and just wanted to sleep (we got there a week before the wedding just to get to sleep off some jet-lag).Once again, overall this was a great stay, and for the money, it was a better deal than the other 5-star types in the area. For the price, I would stay here hands-down over any other hotel in Delhi. That is coming from the demographic of a family that usually stays at Hilton/Sheraton type of hotels on family trips, and Ritz-Carltons for business. "
jaypee siddharth ,"heaven on earth Jaypee Siddharth is one of the finest five star hotel in New Delhi. The hotel's proximity to the Connaught Place by 3kms has made it a preferred stay option. It is an Ideal choice for both leisure and business travellers.Jaypee Siddharth stands tall as a beacon to the comfort hungry Traveller, where your every wish is pampered, where every member of the staff and every facility is dedicated to make you return to this Boutique luxury hotel, time after time.Being on a business trip here, after attending the conferences with my colleagues, I had ample opportunities to unwind in my comfy room with a view nothing less than heaven on earth.The stay has been marvellous, especially the food and ambience of restaurant where I had an option to dine in any of the interesting outlets like Paatra, an Indian restaurant, Tapas, a lounge bar, Eggspectation, a resto-cafe, and the Old Baker, a confectionery shop.Plus the superb experience at the SPA enlightens your soul with its supreme ecstacy.

For me it was a gud experience to stay in siddharth as i came from Mumbai to attend my best friend's marriage ....so i felt relaxed!! "
jaypee siddharth ,"Much Better than Expected We were travelling with a tour party and having read the reviews I was not looking forward to staying here; however, I was pleasantly suprised. The foyer was modern and welcoming, reception was efficient and our room on the second floor was clean and comfortable. Other members of our party were on the 4th floor which had yet to be refurbished and were not impressed. The food was good, including afternoon tea and delicious cakes from the patisserie off the foyer. Staff were helpful and efficient. The location of the hotel is never going to win prizes but was fairly close to the sights of New and Old DelhiThe outside swimming pool was closed for major refurbishment, just as well as the weather was unseasonably cold. A good business/tourist hotel. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Not bad at all! This is my first time in India and we went to walk the Gift Show. As this was a busy time, our travel agent tried to book several mid-priced hotels for us with no luck. Spending $500 - 600 USD per night was just too much. So we were glad that he managed to book the Jaypee for us for $300 USD per night which is still quite high for what we thought we would have to pay for a mid hotel in India. Then I went onto Trip Advisor and read all of the terrible reviews and became quite apprehensive - bringing my own towels and a bedsheet in case the bed was dirty. I also had our sales agent ask the hotel to make sure we had a renovated room in which they confirmed back quickly. Our contract included airport transfer but when we arrived, there was no one there from Jaypee. Not a good start. We called the hotel and they said that there was no record that we needed a pickup. We just got a taxi and headed towards the hotel. Having traveled extensively in Asia, nothing prepared me for the chaotic traffic in Delhi. Everytime I got into a car, I just prayed that we get there safely. When we got to the hotel, I was impressed by the small yet elegant lobby. The check-in was a breeze and learned that using the wireless internet and breakfast was complimentary. I was most apprehensive about the room but when I got in, I could tell it was fully renovated with hardwood floors and marble in the bathroom. There is even a flat screen TV. Though the room is small, it is spacious for two people and the air conditioning works fine. The room was clean and I had no problems using the towels or sleeping in the bed. You do hear some street noise such as the honking from cars, but it really wasn't that bad.The breakfast was pretty good as well with made-to-order eggs and bacon along with a spread of traditional Indian food, fruit, cereals, etc. We also had dinner twice in the Indian restaurant Praata which is very good and reasonably priced.All in all, no complaints about this hotel and compared to the much more expensive 5* hotels, this hotel is good value. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Not Good The general appearance of the hotel is very nice. I had read the reviews advising to avoid this hotel but the agent booked it contraryto my request and advised that the refurbishment was completed. IT IS NOT.We were only here for i night but it was not good. The first room they put us in really had a strong stench from smoking. The second room was a little better and we were pretty tired so we just put up with it. The paint was literally peeling from the wall, not particularly clean and a little warning sign asking to be excused forthe noise that we will experience from the renovation. We then discovered that the fridge didn't work and the kettle didn't work.We had to get up at 3am for an early flight otherwise I would have moved rooms again but if you are using 5 star accommodation you really shouldn't have to put up with this rubbish (most hotel sites list this as a 5 star property) "
jaypee siddharth ,"Jaypee Siddharth not recommended during renovations The City Park Hotel is a much better, less expensive alternative. This hotel is under renovation and you had to access the elevator from the next level (not fun with suit cases). The air condition did not work all of the time throughout the entire building. They were doing construction on the patio until 8pm. Rather than put people on upper floors away from this, they put me right above it. Despite my Orbitz reservation, i had to fihgt them for everything that was confirmed such as a King sized bed and airport transfers.On the way back, they called a &quot;local&quot; taxi without air conditioning to take me back.The bed is hard as a rock - no matter what size.Internet did not work the first night.The breakfast buffet has been better at all other hotels I have seen but the normal menu for dinner is good.One good thing is that this is right off the metro line (Rajendra Place). "
jaypee siddharth ,"Way to expensive Some rooms are still not renovated, look like 15-20 years old, but it doesn't mean that they charge you less if they put you in such a room...The aircondition seems to be a absolute must, only arctic temperatures seem to be acceptable for their guests. Got a stiff neck the first day! Draft in the lobby, the bar, the breakfast restaurant ...By the way, talking about breakfast: If you take an omelette or fried eggs (which they propose you), you have to pay it extra!It's location is central, but that means also noisy. And since they do not invest in noise-proof windows (or insulating windows to save at least some energy for that matter) it means also that the rooms are terribly noisy.Staff is helpful and nice, as I was used to from the other Jaypee Hotel (Jaypee Vasant Continental at the outskirts of Delhi - much better!), but they couldn't make up for the drawbacks of the infrastructure and the absolutely outrageous prices.Internet for a week: more than 100$! (sorry, but this is unacceptable, whil other hotels provide it for free...).If you want any value for your money, choose another hotel. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Discusting ! Bad Location ! Unclean ! I had the misfortune of staying in this god-forsaken hotel in the midst of chaos in Feb 3 and 4, 2007. I was firstly given a room with an interconnecting door ! what a nice feature ! You can hear your neighbours nocturnal noises etc.... Had to sleep one night and then we were given a room on the fifth floor after complaining. Even more disgusting....bathrooms were dirty...fixtures on the wall were old and dusty. All in all we felt like we were moved to a dog house. By no standards it can be called 4 star ! For the price they charge it is definitely not worth it. I hope readers of this review will never stay in any of the Jaypee hotels as the Clarks Shiraz in Agra was the same. BTW, they called these rooms deluxe. Yuk ! Yuk !Forgot to mention the noise levels of both the traffic and the ongoing construction. See pictures attached. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Good and Bad The room we had was refurbished and extremely nice with flat screen tv and waterfall shower. The view out the window was terrible - construction. No double beds were apparently available. Our friends tried to get some, but were moved to an older, unrefurbished room. They moved back the next night.Be warned about the construction! It begins at about 8am and proceeds to about 9pm. Very loud. Also, the pool is not usable (apparently due to the construction), and there is NO business center (we were allowed to sit in a small sales room with a computer for about 150 Rs per 30 minutes, but the connection to the internet was extremely slow, kept failing and the front desk staff had no idea how to operate and/or fix the computer or connection).The doormen were nice, but the front desk staff were extremely rude and unhelpful to me. It was apparently an imposition upon them when they had to answer a question or acknowledge my presence (such as when I checked out).Finally, note that the restaurant plays extremely loud, obnoxious techno music in the mornings (it was Christmas carols to a techno/disco beat when I was there...). You would thus do well to avoid the restaurant in the morning if you are hungover, or cannot tolerate terrible dance mixes. "
jaypee siddharth ,"Better than I expected I stayed in this hotel on November 11th 2006. I had previously read the comments about the hotel and therefore was not expecting it to be as good as it was. Yes, there are renovations going on and therefore the lobby is small and crowded and the reception staff must have a terribly hard time (in my opinion) dealing with customers and the noise. However, there is a man occupying a desk - Travel Desk - and I would advise the management to get rid of him as in my experience and that of one of my colleagues (we were part of a tour group that completed our trip at this hotel) he is useless and rude. He showed such indifference to my query that it was unbelievable. As I said earlier, the reception staff are having to cope with the constant noise and people constantly checking in and checking out and as it's a small area only two of them can fit. It would really help to get rid of the man on the Travel Desk and add an extra receptionst there. However, I have no complaints whatever about the receptionists. My bedroom was fine - comfortable and clean. I noted no smells anywhere. Better/double glazed windows might be good to keep out the noise from the street below. There was some carry on down there that sounded like someone on a loudspeaker repeating the same thing over and over again early in the morning that was rather annoying. The room had a tea/coffee making facility which was nice. The bar staff were very nice and the restaurant that is part of the bar (or vice versa) served very nice food - I had a lovely pasta dish which made a lovely change from three weeks of curries etc! There is a happy hour in the bar from 5 - 7pm (one drink for the price of two) which we availed of. Nice bar, lovely glasses. Perhaps the location is not great but then frankly of the little I saw of Delhi, no location is great but that could be and probably is wrong. The bell boys and door staff at the hotel were very helpful and there were always taxis or motor rickshaws available to take you wherever you needed to go. The hotel needs a proper internet service (it does have one but it is in somebody's office) and it needs an ATM though there is one very close by that has a weird way of working (you put your card in sideways and then take it out and then punch in your numbers, etc) and didn't work at all for me though it did for at least one of my colleagues. I didn't openly pay for this hotel as it was included in my trip price but when looking for Delhi hotels, I found it very hard to find medium priced ones that were highly recommended. I think there is a shortage of hotels there - there was when I stayed that night - or so the rude Travel Desk man told me ie. that there was not a hotel room to be had in Delhi because of some trade conference or such like. I had to go on the internet to find myself another hotel - which I did so Travel Desk man was wrong (as this one couldn't accommodate me for the next night though if they had I would have stayed there). "
jaypee siddharth ,"Do Not Stay!!! Do yourself a favor and NOT stay at this hotel! For the price they charge, you can stay at a much nicer hotel. The smell, are small, and the staff is rude. There was construction going on when i stayed and the hotel also also gave us trouble about the complementary taxi to the airport. Would definately not suggest. "
jaypee siddharth ,Extremely overpriced We stayed at this hotel for one night passing through Delhi on the way to Agra. It is quite old fashioned and drab inside although a sign outside states that refurbishments are in progress so perhaps this is to be improved. There was a terrrible smell in the corridor and to my disgust I found that the room smelled exactly the same. Room service and housekeeping staff were extremely pleasant but refused to leave the room until they were tipped (every time) which I found quite annoying since we were paying $170 approx for the room - way more than it was worth. Bed was hard with old linen but the shower was good. Breakfast was quite good the following morning but to add insult to injury they tried to charge us for it. Thankfully they agreed that this was incorrect. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again as it's simply not worth the money. There are plenty of cheaper hotels that offer the same standard of accommodation..and without the smell! 
jaypee siddharth ,Must do better Hotel ok if a little sanitised but some of the staff who work on reception are unbelievably arrogant &amp; rude. I observed repeated instances which were wholly unacceptable which is a shame as the rest of the staff appear conscientious. An improvement on return visit when it appeared a change in reception staff but even these were not what I would expect and standard below everywhere else experienced (including 2* &amp; below establishments). 
jaypee siddharth ,"Great Place Stayed at the JP Siddartha August 2004. Service, food, room and ambience are all excellent. THere is a also pool, a small gym and health club. Location isn't brilliant as there is little to visit within walking distance and Connaught place/Old Delhi are about 20 - 30 minutes by taxi . However, there will be a metro station outside hotel very soon. In summary, would stay there again. "
jaypee siddharth ,Discreto hotel 
jaypee vasant continental ,would not choose again We stayed one night only at this hotel as it was closer to the airport. We were greeted by a charming girl...but once she was gone there was not one friendly face except perhaps in the business centre. After all our wonderful memories in India...this one wasn't awful....just ordinary!! We had definitely been spoilt with our other choices. 
jaypee vasant continental ,Discriminatory and bad service I have been staying in this hotel for the last 2 years. The rooms have improved after a renovation. Rooms are ok but menu needs to increase at Eggspectation. The horrible thing is the hotel does not respect its guests. I was virtually turned out to wait on the road by one Mr. Bali inspite of staying in that hotel and having a company meeting there. You need to be careful as the staff at the counter looks ok but do not help when accosted with a problem. realised that hotel is discriminatory quite late. 
jaypee vasant continental ,"Perfect Business hotel What a location,Perfect to do business-Close to the airport,close to shopping centre,to restaurants,also for sight seeing.Must have food at the restaurant Ano Tai.Amazing breakfast spread at Eggspectation.The service needs to improve a bit though.Had stayed at The Grand in the same area but stayed away as heard it had caught fire some time back. "
jaypee vasant continental ,Satisfactory Stayed here on a business trip with a colleague for 5 nights. First impressions were that the hotel itself was clean and had a plush entrance. The area the hotel stood in was not very smart and was close to a busy road. There were no other hotels close by as these were mainly in the diplomatic area which was closer to the town. One good thing about this hotel is that it is close to the airport. This becomes of major concern once you realise how bad the traffic can be at certain times of the day and you're in a hurry to get to the airport. If your staying nearer the town centre you'd need to leave in plenty of time!There are a few reasonable restaurants just next to the hotel. Punjab By Nature is a good place to get a tasty curry at a fair price. Otherwise there are the restaurants in the hotel which offer choices based on cost. The rooms are basic but clean. A large screen TV provides lots of channels to choose from in English. Wireless internet available in the room. Free if your staying in the Club Rooms. Bottled water is replenished every day so no need to worry that you're going to run out. In a word I'd say this hotel would suit business travellers better than tourists due to its location. The pool is outdoor and looks OK. 
jaypee vasant continental ,"Enjoied I just returned from Delhi. I stayed on 9th and 10th June 2009. The hotel tariff is reasonable and have all facilities Viz. secretarial services, conference facilities and health club. The hotel is nearer to airport and is veery close to my meeting place i.e. Indian Roads Congress. The environment is excellant. The food and the service provided is very good. I enjoy staying in this hotel. This is 12th time I stayed. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Mix Luxary with Your Business We had two day business meeting in the Hotel Vasant Continental. The hotel is magnificent and we experienced very prompt service. The staff as well as our event organizer was very helpful to us, we never had to worry about the logistics, could focus on the business, the meeting room chairs were causing pain in the back of many participants. The nice thing is almost entire hotel is non smoking zone, the space alloted for smokers was open &amp; very very hot, I personally think its good way to discourage smoking but it would be good if hotel provides a little comfortable space for smokers as few of our members were annoyed by the heat.The swimming pool is very small &amp; so gets crowded in morning hours so couldn't really enjoy it. There were three different restaurants inside the hotel giving choice within Chinese, Indian, Continental categories I could visit two of the restaurants I really liked the Chinese one. We paid INR 6000 plus taxes per night for a room on the which I thought excellent value. There were 2 double beds so the two of us had no difficulty in sharing room. Overall I would say this is probably the one of the better hotels I have stayed in on business trip. Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to save some costs &amp; its your routine meeting. But if you want to take on challenging issues wants to shape better team, mixing a little luxury with the business is must so this choice makes very good sense. "

jaypee vasant continental ,"Excellent base in New Delhi when using an organised group tour Stayed at Jaypee Vasant Delhi when on a Page &amp; Moy Tour during Oct 08. As part of a 30 person group we enjoyed excellent service co-ordinated by our tour manager. Restaurants at the hotel were varied in cuisine offering different styles and excellent quality. Common areas of hotel/ reception were very roomy and cool. Bar was excellent with live music shows and all staff very very attentive and helpful.Partner called ahead for a surprise for Birthday whilst we were staying and staff arranged a bouquet, cake and card on arrival free of charge which was a wonderful surprise.Hotel is some distance from the centre of New Delhi- (about 40 mins in Tuk Tuk) but some would say that this is an advantage to be out of the centre. Immediately outside the confines the hotel boundary you will certainly experience Indian life- it's amazing. All in all a relaxing a calm oasis in amongst busy touring days. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Great Place I stayed in Jaypee Vasanth for my business trip. First of all the location is very convinient. The food quality is excellant and to my surprise the hotel has provided a complimentary wine bottle in my room.The happy hours are really enjoyable.The only disturbing point was the renovation work going on in the hotel at that point of time.If I get an opportunity, I will not hesitate to Sign in once again. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Loved the Hotel I stayed in the hotel for a week when I first shifted to Delhi-2 weeks back.the location is great and everything you need is a mere 2 minutes walk.My room was a good size compared to some of the hotels I have earlier stayed and extremely comfortable..loved the wooden flooring! My room overlooked the pool and I saw quite a bit of green which was a pleasant surprise.The staff was extremely warm and helpful and attentive. The best part is the restaurants(which I continue to visit), especially the Chinese and the cafe with quite an unusual name -Eggspectation..the food is excellent.I would highly recommend this hotel! "
jaypee vasant continental ,"If you're considering this hotel - DON'T. This hotel is situated on a busy corner within a suburb of Delhi. Despite promising first impressions on entering the hotel, this hotel was very disappointing.Several problems occurred during my stay. Firstly, the hotel is undergoing refurbishment in some rooms and my room had a strong smell of glue / solvents. However, that smell was preferrable to the one that met me on entering the bathroom. There was a very strong odour of sewage and I had to request that the bathroom be re-cleaned (which it was). Later in the afternoon, I attempted a nap in the room but couldn't get to sleep due to the continual noise of traffic outside the window. Unfortunately, the noise of horns and reverse alarms continued into the night, making any sleep virtually impossible.The pool area looks good - it is set within nice landscaped lawns with comfortable loungers, but it's dificult to relax when strong whiffs of sewage meet you every 5 / 10 mins.Later, before dinner, I tried to take a shower only to discover that there was no hot water whatsoever in the entire hotel. I was starting to think that nothing else could possibly go wrong but NO - I was awakened by the sound of hammering above my room!In conclusion, if you MUST stay at this hotel - take ear plugs and shower beforehand. "
jaypee vasant continental ,Oasis of Peace in a busy city. This Hotel was selected for its peaceful ambience for a last evening in Delhi prior to flying out the following morning. About 20 minutes drive to Indira Ghandi Intl. airport. We were not disappointed in anyway and in fact the meal we had in the Restaurant ranked as one of the best of our trip. Authentically Indian. There are other restaurants in the building but this was the best.Check in was smooth and the room was well furnished and very comfortable indeed. Check out next morning was very smooth and trouble free. We are not frequent users of &quot;City&quot; Hotels but this more than met our expectations. Friendly without being fussy. Large but not soulless.Just what we needed for a good nights sleep before a long flight.There are gardens but we did not have the time to make use of them. 
jaypee vasant continental ,"Good 4 star A nice hotel. Not exceptional but clean, comfortable, good service and reasonable price - probably better classified as a good 4 star rather than 5 star. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"comfortable hotel in south Delhi This hotel is billed as a 5*, but not a European 5* , think in terms of a good 3* or average 4*.It's about 15 minutes from the main airport, be amazed by the changing route, dual carriage way leading down into a terrible road through a local shopping area, with mad traffic and every kind of transport you can imagine!The hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby, with the main restaurant leading off to one side and the bar to the other.The rooms are of a decent size, with all the normal facilities, very comfortable bed. A very poor hanging area in the wardrobe, constrained by the safe deposit box. A terrible hairdrier, take your own.Plenty of bottled water provided, don't use the tap water, it's not safe. Lots of staff around, they seem to be on the corridor most of the time to attend as required.The bar is very quiet most of the time, but there were several late night events while we there, local discos with terrible music ( it must be my age). Also 2 weddings in the extensive grounds, great to look at, not at all noisy.Breakfast was quite good, but ended promptly, don't expect the staff to leave the food out until you're finished, it just gets cleared away at the right time.The pool area was very clean and pool towels were always available. Good pool for lengths, not a leisure pool.The gym is on the second floor, is not advertised, but use is free, it has all the normal equipment and staff on hand. The sauna, steam room and jacuzzi all have a charge. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Excellent except for the Spa Most helpful and frindly staff!Excellent restaurants. Expensive, but quality &amp; service justify the price.Pool environment does not very much invite to the -impeccable clean- pool. No deck chairs, what a pitty.The massage room is far too small and the masseur not up to his job.Rooms are great, first class materials for furniture and installations, bath room was a delight, even though I booked the cheapest room!Needless to say thet the huge plasma TV with uncountable Sat-channels was a highlight.Small things like flowers, cookies, chocolates that keep appearing are a very nice surprise.Not a cheap place, but worth every rupee! "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Great place to stay!! Hotel Vasant Continental is a wonderful hotel. They have a nice little gym, yoga classes, spa and salon, and great restaurant. The breakfast buffet which came with our room, (we booked a double) was delicious, they had both Western breakfast offerings, an omelette station, and South Indian breakfast as well, not to mention fresh fruit. Anything else that wasn't on the menu you could ask the staff and they would arrange it for you. I never tried the room service, as I like to be out exploring the city's hot spots, but there was always plenty of bottled water, my sheets and towels were always clean and fresh and they even gave us boxed chocolates every day. They also have a tea coffee maker and sugar, etc. Might I add that the bathrooms are spotless. The location just next to the Vasant Priya cinema is ideal, it's close to the city spots but not right on the main road so the rooms are quiet. I also arrived a day early from my trip to Nasik and they accommodated us at the last minute with an extra double. So I can't complain. LOVELY! "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Excellent Hotel Excellent stay at this hotel! Rooms were clean and staff friendly! Breakfast was included in our stay which was at a nice restaurant within the hotel! - Also were provided with a bottle of wine and fruits when we first checked in! - There was a party at the hotel on fri night! hip hop night, which was excellent for us young people! overall i would recommend this hotel. The local area is quite good as it is right next to hotel, a few restaurants (would recommend the italian in the local area) ... All local ameneties nearby! "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Satisfactory stay Located in south delhi, this hotel is a bit away from the business quarter. Rooms are adequate and service is what one would expect in a business-oriented hotel. A good chinese cuisine restaurant was a surprise. "
jaypee vasant continental ,Good hotel okay service.... We stayed in Jaypee Vasant Continental just for a night in transit between International and domestic flight. Hotel itself was clean and nice. Room was also well maintained and room-service was prompt and food was of good quality. Only thing that I didnt like was that while checking in we were treated very well- however while checking out they didnt even bother to pick our luggage and help with cab esp given that we were with an infant. Felt somewhat shoddy since they charged over $250 just for a nights stay. 
jaypee vasant continental ,"pleasant hotel near airport Stayed here last week because all other hotels were booked. Hotel was pleasant surprise, as it was in a quiet area and had good food (though expensive) and newly refurbished and clean rooms. Hotel is located near JNU campus and airport. Also around the corner is western style shopping area. I found this hotel much better value for money than the Grand Intercontinental Hotel, where I stayed earlier this month, which was not very clean and looked like it could do with a bit of fresh paint. "
jaypee vasant continental ,"Consistently good Recently renovated and modern. Excellent buffet style b'fast. Good in room dining. Only complaint is the insufficient access to internet. Two computers is inadequate and the service should be included with the room rate at a hotel of this caliber.For women, check out the well priced beauty parlor. I had my eyebrows &quot;threaded&quot; (plucked) - very well done. I will be using these services more on my next trip. "

jukaso inn downtown ,"Small Rooms Hi, The hotel is very conviniently located at the middle circle on CP. The rooms are clean &amp; the beds are soft &amp; comfortable. There are 2 issues (1) The rooms are very small (2) One has to climb 2-3 flights of stairs to reach the room as its spread over 3 floors with no lift. Insist for discount &amp; upto 20% of the tariff will be waived. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"better than average Stayed at one other hotel in the same area, in comparison, this seemed more deserving of the &quot;mid-range&quot; or 2-3 star designation. The hallways were clean, well lit; well decorated. The rooms were larger than the other hotel; the bathroom was cleaner and larger---the bathing area had a little wall around it so the floor did not get wet, unlike many Indian bathrooms. The beds were clean and comfy. Internet access was pricey but available. The cost was higher, but as our last night in India, we desperately needed a nice clean send-off and it was. We were two women travelling and were treated well. Our friends stayed previously, and they had a nice time as well. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"Jukaso Inn is not worth it Very overpriced. Rooms are ok but no great shakes. For Rs3700 (don't forget extra taxes!), it's 50 pounds and you'd get better in London.Staff are not helpful and are just trying to sell you services.A chap is introduced to you as the travel desk. He says he can give free maps, free travel advice and 15mins free of internet service. Then he takes you on a 5 min walk to a travel agent that just trys to sell you tours!Return to hotel and ask for a bank and they say they will do the changing for you. Ask for a taxi stand and they say they will get you a taxi. All you want is some honesty but all they want is your money.Avoid. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"Jukaso Inn Downtown - thumbs down Our room was clean and comfortable. Seemed overpriced, but this was the only hotel we stayed at in Delhi so difficult to make a comparison. We were referred to a travel agency by the hotel, Perfect Holiday Travels, that was full of touts. Do not trust this hotel with any of your travel arrangements, or this travel agency. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"Worst hotel I used in India but far from the worst in the world I paid about $80 for one night here (the Connaught location) in November. I was able to check in early in the morning and was shown a room and told I could choose another if I wasn't happy with it. It looked fine to me, so I took it and got settled in.I didn't find the room itself to be dirty at all. It was comfortable enough, and the television worked. There was a window, but it was impossible to lift up the heavy curtains to actually look outside.The bathroom was another story. It was dirty and falling apart like I expected bathrooms in India to be (this was the first time it actually happened in a hotel though). You could tell that if you removed the mirror from the wall, you'd have a big gaping hole and be looking out onto the street. In the middle of a shower, I ran out of water completely.I had a tour picking me up at 5 a.m., and the front desk did actually call to inform me the car had arrived.Service was somewhat rude when I checked in and downright awful when I checked out. I informed the bellman I'd need a taxi, and he told me he would call. Apparently this never happened, and I came close to missing my flight because of it. I was waiting around for awhile until I finally asked the front desk who informed me no one had been called, and it would be about a 30 minute wait. Lucky for me, the taxi showed up right away, and I was able to escape this place in a hurry.If you really don't care what kind of place you're staying in, Jukaso is fine. It's not awful, but I paid about half the price for other hotels in India that were far nicer with better service than this one. However, considering the high prices in Delhi, it's probably not possible to do better for the money. It won't kill you to stay here, but you won't be yearning to go back anytime soon. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"Can't believe this place was recommended by Lonely Planet My girlfriend and I stayed at Hotel Jukaso Inn (the one in Connaught Place) for our first night in India on 10/11/07. We booked the hotel online in a last minute rush because other than our plane tickets and initial waitlisted New Delhi-Jaisalmer train ticket, we had organised nothing for our holiday in India. We paid 3850Rs + tax for one double room.We were very disappointed. We thought this standard may have been par for the course for this price in New Delhi/India, but as we tried other accommodation during our trip through Rajasthan/India, we realised that we had been clearly ripped off. The hotel room was dirty, small, and didn't have a window. The hotel service was poor. We learnt from our stay, however, that one of the best things to do with hotels in India is to check a few rooms out first, because there seems to be significant variation in a lot of places. "
jukaso inn downtown ,"Not the right Juakso - oops? I booked at the Jukaso Inn after reading a favorable review in Frommers Guide Book. Having never been to Delhi, I didn't realize that I had booked the WRONG Jukaso Inn. I booked into the downtown, Connaught Circle location, when the guide book was recommending the Sunder Nagar location. Our stay was fine. The hotel was really nothing special, nor terrible. Just average. But I mention it because it's possible that others who have reviewed this hotel might have been reviewing the wrong location? "

The rooms are excellent, nicely done up.The only thing that needs a bit of upbringing is the bell staff, which still gives you a taste of the legacy.Would certainly recommend staying at the hotel, though is slightly over-priced. "
le meridien new delhi ,"I just loved the stay I Stay there for a bussiness trip from my company.I throughly enjoyed the staying there.The service there is excellent and the hotel staffs are very helpfull. The breakfast there is complimentary.Room was a nice one with TV, comfertable bed with pillow, mood lighting and many more. "
le meridien new delhi ,"WONDERFUL STAY We stayed here last week for 4 days and had a great time. Room (standard double) was lovely - woodern floors, quality furnishings, flatscreen TV, comfy bed with pillow menu, mood lighting. Bathroom was beautiful with a huge walk-in shower. Staff very helpful and whenever you phone down to housekeeping they respond very quickly. A couple of gripes were that the mini bar was lacking in choice (just beer, champagne and soft drinks). Turn down service was always around 7 pm which was inconvenient if you are getting ready to go out for dinner. The hotel bar (Nero) was great, with a great, humidified smoking room and very attentive staff - shame it shuts at 1 am... always thought a 5 star hotel should have the bar open till the last guest had left. Monsoon the Indian restaurant was fabulous, pricy but worth it (the herb prawn starter was to die for), the Chinese on the top floor was a disappointment however. Breakfast was good - plenty of choice. Henry's bar on the top floor as another reviewer has said is just a room with drinks, not a bar, and soulless.The pool was a bit dingy - not warm enough to swim in at this time of year, and alot of it was in shadow with only a few beds. You are not allowed alcohol around the pool which is a shame when you want to have lunch and a couple of beers (nothing that sneaking beers down from your mini bar did not solve!).The spa was amazing - we had two massages, and if you are feeling romantic the couples room with private hot tub is worth the extra £25! Both massages (Indian and Swedish) were fabulous with wonderful staff and rituals.The atrium and the whole look of the hotel from the inside was fabulous - quite breathtaking. If you want to buy pashmina - there is a great shop inside the hotel that sells them from about £15 upwards, far better value than we found in Old Delhi. All in all, we were delighted with the hotel and our whole stay, and if we were to return to Delhi, we would stay at Le Meridien again. "
le meridien new delhi ,Excellent location and serivce I have stayed at this hotelabout 3 times in last 2 years and the serivce at hotel is always great.Location is great.The only thing I would say is that when I booked this time through AAA there was extra charge for breakfast rate and when I reached hotel bkfst was complimentary.We enjoy our stay here everytime.

le meridien new delhi ,"Top hotel with western standards.....and prices Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in two different rooms. Clean, modern hotel with good design throughout including &quot;mood lighting&quot; in the rooms. Staff were very helpful as you would hope/expect in a hotel of this class/price. Only thing was we could not get the wi-fi to work (you needed a laptop rather than a PDA) so ended up using the expensive business centre to check email.Near Connaught Place for restaurants. There are some good bars/restaurants in the hotel but they are very pricey.We would consider staying in this hotel if we were to return to Delhi. "
le meridien new delhi ,Perfect Hotel Le Meridien is like an oasis in New Delhi! The hotel was my favourite place in the city! Friendly staff. Very safety. We received a welcome drinks (coffee and tee) and welcome &quot;bindi&quot;. I had offer from the hotel (like a compliment) for a 3-4 hours trip in the city. i just do not like the sandal woods flavour in my wardrobe. But it is all over the India :) I prefer The One restaurant because of the not chili food :) 
le meridien new delhi ,Great hotel in Delhi Great stay at Le Meridien in Delhi. Excelent hospitality and service. Restaurants pretty expensive. 
le meridien new delhi ,"Exquisite hotel I stayed here always when I visited New Delhi. The lobby is amazing; futuristic style.Room is great and spacious, beautiful bathroom. Well designed and modern; Exquisite.Very clean and well organized.Large flat screen tv in the room.Wi-fi available with charge.The concierge was very helpful.The hotel staff friendly.Excellent breakfast.There are some shopping arcade in the hotel. Try to visit Jaipur Gem Palace, they have nice collection of jewelry with reasonable price.It's near by Janpath street if you want to do some more shopping, walking distance.It's a great hotel. "
le meridien new delhi ,"A-void! If you like 1970s-style hotels with multi-floor atriums - or a large void in the middle, this may be hotel for you! Otherwise, I would a-void it. Sure, it is in a nice part of New Delhi, close to the key government building and several sights. However, the hotel is currently under renovation, which means jackhammers and workmen throwing stuff out windows. The power went off (and on again) multiple times while I was there. The room had no bath, only a shower with a barely-controllable nozzle. And the darkened &quot;bathroom&quot;, with mood lighting, smelt. The renovated room was decorated out in a cross between Ikea and Norwegian wood, with lots of sharp corners to bump into at night. The front desk staff were slow to serve on the way in, and looking for extras to add to the bill on the way out. The restaurant food was over-priced. I didn't try Room Service, but could see samples of their offerings still sticking to the TV remote control. The hotel's pool area was a real gathering place for hot birds - about 100 pigeons and a dozen crows I counted. The views of Delhi from the top level eatery are excellent - but in the middle of the top floor of the building the viewless Le Meridien Club is perched like a UFO, waiting to descend on unsuspecting diners eating in the atrium below. Next time, I think I will stay at the Shangri-La across the road. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Best Hotel One of the very best hotel I stayed. I was staying in a suite, the design is modern and furniture are as new. The hotel is located in the city centre area, but the room rate is surprisingly low, and staffs are nice. Other than the shower area is a bit small, you cannot pick up anything to complaint about. I took a buffet dinner on the ground floor cafe, the food is good, but it cost you US$70 per person. "
le meridien new delhi ,"calm escape from the chaos great hotel, very modern interior, spacious and airy. didnt appear to be many western visitors there. highly recommend all restaurants, particularly the chinese rest located on top floor. colonial decor but with great food and great view over delhi.down side would be lack of fast free internet acces, poor pool and sundeck area.

le meridien new delhi ,What A Chic Place ..my 6th stay in this year It is one of the most classy elegant trendy hotel i have ever seen during my business travel. Meridien after being taken over by starwood has done tremendous change in its approach. Spg is the winning card always thats why i started staying in this hotel. Earlier they had some work early this year but now what swanky atrium sexy bar nero aand cutest are comp stations in atrium where i sip illy and work as room gets boring if u in hotel for couple of days.Staff is amazingly helpful and take care of elderly people too as i noticed couple of girls in atrium...was touched by it.Their new Indian restaurant monsoon is one of its own as i had meal with my colleagues in there and we enjoyed. Some Indian families at entrance not very happy as children not allowed but for thats a great news as i did two lunch meetings in there.Good fitness centre amatra help me stay fat freeIts a beautiful clean stylish hotel where staff makes you feel at home if u alone. One imp thing internet is good. Would recommend business travelers definitely.Rooms is again brilliant clutter free lot of space for my things which is good 
le meridien new delhi ,Still some problems I have staying in this hotel whenever I am in Delhi but I have experienced some irritations.#1: the hotel did not send a limo to the airport because my PA did not inform them. I would expect the hotel to ask for my flight schedule. This differentiates the best from the better.#2: Security check has been stepped up. I love this but to surrendder my swiss knife shows lack of discretion. Swiss knife is not a lethal weapon. A 200 kg man is a lethal weapon.#3: I just returned from the gym after cutting short my work out. They were BLASTING Indian Techno music even after I have requested for a lower volume. I was the only guest using it at that time. 
le meridien new delhi ,"One of my favourite Hotels Having stayed here quite a few times, i can only say that the hotel has always been a class apart.. Great service, great food, excellent rooms and a good location. What else could a traveller ask for??The hotel lobby is expansive and beautiful. Checkins are always quick and the room is always just right.. Overall a great hotel with superb facilities.. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Beautiful hotel in a great location; more style than substance at times When you walk into this hotel you will greated by a visually stunning city hotel. The staff are generally helpful and attentive (though note my comment later). It is a hotel that caters well for business and leisure travellers. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. We were on the 10th floor and had a great view over Delhi. We had a view of the outdoor swimming pool. I didn't use it, but it looks nice. However, there were often pigeons sitting around the edge and drinking from it!! Hence only 4 stars for 'Cleanliness'. The breakfast is buffet-style and tasty. There is a mixture of Indian and Western dishes, both hot and cold. One thing that I found quite annoying was that the coffee they use is tasteless and instant. When I asked for proper coffee they said it would take 10 minutes and cost more. I was not bothered by the cost, but rather that this is a 5* hotel and should be doing better on something so basic. We ate dinner in one of the hotel restaurants - for a 5* hotel it was average and over-priced. One afternoon 3 of us were having a drink in the lovely hotel cafe. We were taking a few photos of each other and were told that we weren't allowed to take photos inside the hotel! And we weren't given a reason!! The staff were almost 100% fantastic. However, there was an incident that left a sour taste in my mouth. The day before check-out I hired a private hotel car to take the 3 of us to the airport. The next morning, after we had checked-out, I went to the desk to arrange for the car to be brought round to the front. Annoying they quoted a higher price. They could not explain why and could not explain why they didn't contact me earlier. The ledger in which they write down bookings was on the desk, and next to my name the original quoted price had been crossed out and a new price written above it. I challenged them on this. The two staff spoke to each other about me in Hindi and clearly didn't realise that I understood that they were making disparaging comments about me. When I told them that I understood Hindi they looked shocked and went pretty silent! On principle, and after being treated in this manner, I refused to pay the higher price. They responded by saying that we would have to make our own way to the airport. I asked to be taken to the manager and suddenly our car was brought round to the front and we paid the price quoted the night before. I was in two minds as to whether to recommend this hotel. However, it is a 5* hotel and so needs to be held to a higher standard then other hotels of a lower rating. Given that there are lots of great 5* hotels in Delhi, I would suggest trying them instead. "
le meridien new delhi ,"In the middle of everything--and nowhere The hotel is located right in the center of the civic district, within walking distance of Connaught Place and short rides from most of the Beaux Arts buildings. But if it is the real bustling energetic and chaotic Delhi you are after, this is probably not the place for you.The room I had was excellent--apparently recently renovated. Room service was attentive and housekeeping was diligent. In general service was courteous and competent. They provided complimentary water, which is very important for Delhi.The swimming pool, however, is not that clean, even if not many people use it. Too many pigeons and crow use it as a bird bath--and leave their stuff next to its rim.The hotel should do something about the touts next to its main gate who nag visitors to visit emporiums. The touts really make for a very frustating time--it got to a point where I exited the hotel's main gate only to enter at its other gate so as to escape a particularly eager tout.Finally, for a business hotel, Le Meridien does not provide free Internet connection! For such a pricey hotel, though admittedly its rates are not much different from its neighbors, it charges another 12 usd or so for wireless internet per day. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay I stayed in the hotel with my associates for a few days of meetings and everything went as planned. I do not have any complaints at all.The room was of a comfortable size. Perhaps the only complaint here is that the wardrobe was rather small and the bar for the hangers rather high. There were also bedroom slippers so save packing on those.I was at the Club level and the room had a shower rather than a bathtub; some of my associates had bathtubs, which I would have liked as a warm soak at the end of a hard day is very relaxing. The shower stall however had this &quot;rainstorm&quot; shower coming from the top. The water pressure was sufficiently generous to make me feel cleaned by rain. And there was also a shower hose.There were four apples of the Red Delicious variety but the food I had was good and I was not tempted to snack. There were some reviews that the apples were dessicated but not in my case.An odd incident was that I received different newspapers every day that I was there. Four days were national papers and then one day it was the IHT.The bar at the 20th floor offers a splendid view of Delhi. You'll realise how surprisingly green and low-rise it is.I would like to comment on the seeming compulsion of tip-seeking. The reason is quite simple: poverty. The Indian who is serving you as waiter or driver has a monthly salary lower than the cost of the room. I asked and apparently the worldwide average of the wage bill for a hotel is about 27-28%; in India, it is 10%. Arguably, this means that Indian worker is underpaid. But I have also heard comments that it is because they are less efficient, something that I would tend to agree with.Consider it a backhanded compliment that they hound you for tips. They think you are wealthy. Perhaps because I am Asian as opposed to Anglo I never experienced such houndings even once. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Good hotel not so good service I stayed here for three nights during a business trip and felt that the service let the hotel down.The hotel is very centrally located and the contemporary design sets it apart from other hotels in Delhi. Also the rooms are fairly spacious (but too dark!) and the facilities like the restaurants, bar and gym are really very good. However, the service was not what I would expect from a 5* hotel when paying these kinds of room rates. I had problems with my booking confirmation, changing rooms and hotel car service. Overall I was left with the impression that the convenience for staff comes before guest requirements. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Fine - but where in the world are we? This is a great place for those who want a hotel that helps them forget they are in India. Colleagues I was traveling with, for whom coming to India was a rare treat, were disappointed that there was no attempt to showcase anything Indian. So this is less a hotel for tourists than for business travelers.Thank goodness the thermostats in the rooms worked properly. The airconditioning in the rest of the hotel was so cold that my friends and I had to leave a dinner to get jackets. As someone from Southeast Asia, where you get what you pay for, I have never understood why Delhi hotels are able to charge what they do. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Highly recommended Stayed two night here while temperatures were above 42C in the city - this very much felt like an oasis. Reading previous reviews I assume that there had been some modernization in the past, and some issues, but my experience was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Decor was superb with imported italian glass tiles everywhere. Rooms were in excellent shape, large, and beautifully done. Tried all the restaurants and bars on the ground floor - Monsoon is one of the top indian restaurants in Delhi and was recommended by one of my Indian friends, the bar has an excellent selection (albeit somewhat pricy). Excellent breakfast buffet in the morning included with the room price.As previous comments, everyone did indeed expect a tip, but this is the same in any hotel. Staff was very accommodating in providing a late checkout without my even asking. Car service about 2000IRP, which is 4X a taxi, but well worth the 1 hour trip is modern air conditioned car.Only downside, morning restaurant staff seemed to act too cool and hence getting their attention somewhat of a problem. And front door staff somewhat slow in reacting to requests for a taxi if you were dressed very casually. Location was excellent for business and leisure. "

le meridien new delhi ,"Meridien Mistake What a disgraceful hotel - quite how they manage to claim this is a 5 Star hotel, I do not know. They should not be allowed to sport the Le Meridien brand - its an absolute disgrace.First of all, our airport pick-up failed to arrive in spite of a booking and a phone call to confirm. They still tried to charge us for it at check-out.The check-in staff were arrogant and rude and in fact so were the majority of the staff in the hotel including a lady duty manager who is rude and unhelpful. Every member of staff wants to be tipped - quite why I do not know as they do not offer any form of service. Even the room attendant waits until our return to the room trying to obtain a tip. Perhaps the hotel could pay these people more money to stop them harrassing the customers.The keycard failed to operate, so we obtained a replacement which also failed to operate. We asked the reception staff to come up with us with a keycard to open the door. The failed keycards were a regular theme during our stay and the staff blamed us for keeping them with our mobile phones rather than accepting the cards are rubbish.Everything is expensive from car hire to food yet nothing is worth the money. To add insult to injury staff then expect to be tipped! Pay the staff more Mr Le Meridien to stop them begging.Restaurant staff are slow and ineffective - they forget orders, are slow to deliver food/drinks and seem disinterested in being there. However they are still eager for their tips.Security was a joke - I would sometimes get searched, sometimes not. My wife would never get searched. Luggage did not get scanned! What a complete shambles.The room was dimly lit and would not get bright enough to get ready. The air conditioning next to useless and the floors in the room creak so loudly when you walk on them that everyone wakes up. Noise from neighbouring rooms and toilets makes you wonder if you are in a bedsit in a cheap part of town.A fruit bowl with four apples in it that are as dry as the sahara desert - how long have they been there? Come on Le Meridien - this is damaging your brand.On a positive note, the location is good for shopping and getting around. There are two fantastic hotels nearby - Shangri-La and Ramada - both of which will be an option next time we are here unlike the Le Meridien. "

le meridien new delhi ,"God knows ! if renovation is over? I stayed here while renovation or repair works of this property was going on. There was although no problem of noise or visible dirt, but most of the areas of the hotel I visited were all in a cramped and &quot;camp-like&quot; condition. Hence overall dining experience was spoilt.Printers / Xerox at business center didn't work, hence I was not billed, but I had to go to a road-side Xerox vendor in Delhi on my way to the meeting.Front-office staff is not at all courtious. Despite the fact that I was a SPG member and that I asked for a good room, I was given a room right in front of barricades made for renovation works.

le meridien new delhi ,"A gem in the Jewel of the Crown Le Méridien is known for its stylish hotels, and the one in Delhi is not an exception. Service was very good, from the driver who waited for me at the airport with a refreshing towel and a cold drink in the car, to the attendant serving drinks in the Royal Club, all were nice and welcoming people. The lobby is literally awesome, and very hip. Not so for the desk staff, both at check-in and check-out service was peculiarly impersonal. The room was very cool, with mood lighting and a view on the India Gate (as requested at the time of booking). Bathroom amenities are the best I've ever seen, including even band-aids, shaving kits and a toothbrush. I can recommend the spa with some hesitation: the treatment was fabulous, but the staff at the reception was not interested and even made a small error in the booking which, after I discovered it too late, took me ages to get corrected and they were wholly unapologetic for their mistake. Shame. Location is perfect, a comfortable 10-15 minute walk from the India Gate or the amazing Presidential Palace in a very green and quiet neighbourhood of this city of millions. I popped in at the Shangri-La next door for some Indian cuisine (the Meridien's Indian restaurant was being refurbished and I had to have some Indian food!). The Shangri-La is bland and the food... let's just say I've had better Indian food in Africa! In all, I'd very much like to stay at the Meridien again! "

le meridien new delhi ,"Cheated by Hotel Management I recently stayed at Le Meridien New Delhi and it was unequivocably the worst experience I have ever had in a 5-star hotel.1) My account was mishandled by the hotel staff resulting in my being unjustly charged around 100 USD for international phone calls that the hotel requested I make to provide them with an alternate credit card number along with copies of the front and back of the card, because the hotel's payment system was antiquated and the staff claimed that they they could not process the credit card I had previously provided them upon check-in without taking copies of the front and back of the card (a highly unsual and suspect practice, which made me even more wary as my wallet had been stolen I suspect either in or around the hotel), and this was despite the fact that the hotel had put a 250 USD hold on my card and the card was otherwise perfectly usable.2) Prior to charging the new card number, the hotel did not present me with my folio or any breakdown of charges or even provide me with the total balance. Once the staff received the faxed copy of the front and back of the new card, they proceeded to charge the card without my verification of the total charges. When I requested my folio at the front desk upon check out, I was presented with the credit card receipt showing the amount the staff had charged the new card, and I was told after my request to see my bill, that is was &quot;too late&quot;, that the card had already been charged- a fait d'accompli.I tried to dispute the charges while still at the hotel, but the staff were uncooperative in escalating the dispute to their superiors, and after numerous phone calls and emails, I still have not been credited back the aformentioned charges.3) On a more minor note, the property I also did not feel was up to 5 star standard. More specifically, despite having negotiated an equivalent price at the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal (I had previously stayed within the Taj group during my stay in India), I chose Le Meridien for my final night in India to experience a more &quot;modern&quot; 5 star hotel in the country. However, upon check-in, front desk staff failed to inform me of two important facts, that the deluxe room they gave me failed to feature a bathtub, which I would have expected in a five star property, and that the all day dining establishment was undergoing construction which caused alot of noise as it is located in the courtyard in the middle of the property around which all the rooms are situated.I would warn any potential guests from Le Meridien New Delhi, as I feel that management are not quite above board in their practices.

The rooms were very nice and new we stayed on the 12th floor which was quite a nice view over the india gate and the street below. The hotel food is nice but expensive, breakfast is okay.

Pool not available as being repaired, outside patio area was covered in pigeon s... Good central location. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Fine Business traveller place under acceptable conditions I stayed in the Le Meridien for three days on my annual business trip to India last week. My rep booked the place and which first struck me was the pricing. Last year 4-5 Star Delhi hotels costed around 200-300 EUROs a night. Now I payed 5500 INR which totals 81 EUROs a night including breakfast. This was really a good deal!!1. ARRIVAL AT INDIRA GHANDI INTERNATIONAL:I asked my rep to arrange pickup by the hotel. The Sadar driver waited at the exit for me and took care of my luggage. He wanted me to change some money (while he could watch over my shoulder and see what I will be changing and calculate the amount of his tip). As I am annually travelling to India since almost 15 years I declined his offer to lead me to the Thomas Cook booth and I told him that I brought Rupees with me already. Then the story of his &quot;two poor Children&quot; came up and I told him that I am not caring at all and advised him to drive me to the hotel as quickly as possible and upon the arrival I would decide about his tip. He stayed quiet and did what I asked him to do. Upon the arrival I gave him 50 Rupees. It is defintely not advisable to give more tip in India. 2. ARRIVAL AT THE LE MERIDIENThe arrival is similar to security check at an airport 20 years ago. My luggage was brought into the lobby and I had to pass a metal detector and was handsearched afterwards. My handluggage was also searched. When I passed the security area (makes sense after 11/26 incidents in Mumbai) I walked into a boutique style lobby which was fairly empty that late at night.3. CHECKIN:As a Starwood Preferred Guest I was given a room on the 12th floor which is their &quot;Starwood Preferred Guest Floor&quot;. The checkin was fast and efficient, the luggage was brought to my room within three minutes after I closed the door of my room.4. THE ROOM:Looked recently renovated, the light coloured wooden decor may not be of everyones taste, the &quot;mood light&quot; behind the bed as well-but they at least tried to do a bit different from the wannabe colonial style in other Delhi hotels such as the Taj Mansing, the Park etc. TV was a 46 inch plasma with tons of channels. The mini bar was well filled and relatively cheap (approx. 1,20 EURO for a soda), Room service worked well but seemed to be easily disappointed about Indian-style tipping from a European. The room was very clean and big enough for two. The lighting in the bath was a bit dark but also pretty well designed and everything was in good shape and working order. Loved the rain-shower.... The control panel for all the lights, alarm and A/C (not necessary last week with temperatures around 25 degrees outside) is a bit confusing but works pretty well if one understands how it works. All over all a very good experience. In room safe and all the little 4-5 star hotel gadgets were in the room and made the stay very nice. 2 Newspapers a day, a printout of a German newspaper`s front page, fresh fruit and bottled water were complementary every day. I had a direct view from my room to India Gate and the Red Fort.5. BREAKFAST:Breakfast was complementary and complete. A cooking station provided fresh eggs, omlettes etc. (plan a bit waiting time), juices and fruits were fresh, the choice of continental/English breakfast from the buffet war rich. Be aware: They`ll seat you the french breakfast style - you will be sitting on a long large table with strangers opposite and next to you if you come alone to the breakfast room. Nothing unusual if you have travelled to France.... FAZIT:Positve:- excellent value- well equipped, maintained room- clean and safe place- good breakfast- excellent location (right within Government district, close to Connought)Negative:- still some construction going on (bar &amp; cafeteria is being built)- some greedy staffI will definitely come again next year.

le meridien new delhi ,"Best Hotel in Delhi The best hotel ever! Amazing breakfast buffet, amazing indian restaurant on the 2nd floor. Service, staff, decor was top class. This is the only hotel I would stay at when i return to Delhi. Highly recommend it! "
le meridien new delhi ,"An Oasis for Tired Travelers This was our first stop on a &quot;Heart of India&quot; tour (14 people). Arriving at 6 am --after delayed flights and a harrowing ride --the first of many-- from the airport, we were so pleased to have a clean bed and hot water. Le Meridien was far more.The staff, except for a &quot;lady&quot; in the business center, who was so rude I seriously thought of complainig to the front desk, was most accommodating --our &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign that first morning was honored.The room was spotless; the breakfast outstanding.The hotel did not have great charm, but it did have a bonus. We were there during &quot;marriage season,&quot; and we could see the fireworks displays throughout the city. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Disappointed My husband and I stayed here at the end of our 3 week trip to India. Most of the lobby area was under construction, and was noisy until 9pm. We couldn't access the shopping arcade. We had to switch rooms late at night, and the information wasn't communicated to the day staff the next day, requiring several conversations with different people.While the front desk staff was friendly, they were unhelpful with suggestions/directions to major tourist locations. There was always a backup of cars entering the hotel. It was definitely geared to the business traveler. While it was centrally located, would check out other hotels on our next visit. "
le meridien new delhi ,"nice hotel good standard building and rooms are nice. gym is good, outdoor pool is a disgrace and a health hazard (dozens of pigeons all over).staff is generally helpful. food ok. all in all a good option in Delhi but not quite international 5 star.Once one is accustomed to Delhi hotel prices, the rates are acceptable. worth bargaining hard. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Fine business hotel The hotel is perfectly fine. Nothing special (except the service was very good). Rooms were clean and everything functioned properly. Restaurants were good. Gym and pool were fine. It just doesn't have much soul or character. Fine for business, but if you're looking for a taste of India, it doesn't have much. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Bon Jour Meriden well to start with the best thing about the property is the location itself. Its located right right in the heart of New Delhi, amidst a lot of greenery as well as the proximity to almost all of Delhi's tourist hot spots. Well connected to the airport as well as the railway station. Once you get into the hotel you fell this out of the world experience as you step into the pristine white lobby. The highly courteous staff, excellent rooms at very reasonable price and the highly recommendable Indian Specialty restaurant PAKWAN, are few of the high points of this ultra luxurious 5 star deluxe property "
le meridien new delhi ,"OK to arrive at business services a rip off I wanted to get a nice room to relax in and assimilate for my first trip to India. I had some business meetings in New Delhi and my daughter is going to university for a semester so it was great to visit. The first of several upsales at the hotel was to get an extra room key from the front desk. We explained she had a home in Delhi but apparently that didn't suffice. The room was nice. The hotel is within walking distance to landmarks such as India Gate and the national museum. Metro system is easily accessible as well. Food at the first level buffet was good and affordable. Great place for a morning coffee. We ate at the Chinese restaurant at the top of the hotel and it was nothing to get excited about other than being convenient to the room. The hotel was doing some renovations but they were efficient and clean. The Spa experience was disrupted by some drilling but life goes on.I had the Indian Spa experience. I was after a simple stress reduction massage. After a reservation discussion, I agreed to a 60 minute massage. The Spa called my room to see if I could arrive 30 minutes earlier. Considering that I had made the reservation 8 hours earlier it was mildly annoying. When I checked in at the Spa, the earnest female clerk insisted that I really needed a 90 minute massage. I insisted that the 60 minutes would be just fine. After much discussion behind the counter I was asked to meet with the &quot;doctor.&quot; I was met by the doctor who prescribed both inter and external problems with me and 90 minutes was necessary for my apparent issues. I was amused and agreed by signing several releases to 90 minutes, after all, he is a doctor.I actually loved the 30 minute leg reflexology delivered by a remarkably talented Chinese masseuse. You are never touched above the knee and it was fantastic. I awoke absolutely refreshed. Amazing. The synchronized massage which involves two people was interesting but I won't be doing that again. Probably a personal preference of mine and not a reflection of the oils, talent or handling by the masseuse pair.The worst annoyance was printing 10 pages from a thumb drive for a presentation in the business center, one page was blank. It cost me about 23.00 dollars American and was a total rip-off. It was handled by a woman who could have been in Vogue magazine. She was unable to provide me with a receipt and I was in a hurry. I think she was the Doctors wife. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Great Hotel! Service is where they excel! Stayed at the LeMeridian in Delhi for 2 weeks on business in May. Was an excellent stay -- many nice touches you would expect from a 5 Star Hotel.Airport TransfersHotel arranged pickup. I was met by a concierge at the airport who helped me find my car, where cold towels and bottled water were waiting. Courteous driver, pointed out the sites along the way and made a few suggestions for things I might want to see during my tripFront desk/ServiceSmooth, efficient and friendly each time I interacted with them. Each person I met on the staff was friendly, greeted you, and smiled. I felt very welcome by everyone!RoomsThere are two color schemes in rooms --- one dark, one light. Some people have issues with the dark room, but I liked it. Beds were very comfortable, bathrooms were large and functional, lighting was good. Room was serviced at least twice a day -- bottled water was restocked each time. Most evenings, I received a cheese or desert plate when my room was serviced. Over each weekend, I was given a new book as a gift. Had the hotel do laundry at one point -- no issues and very prompt service. Internet connection worked wonderfully and the switchboard had no issues with the calls I got at all hours of the night from the US.Breakfast/LoungeIncluded in the rate -- either in the executive lounge or the main restaurant. Both were nice depending on your mood --- there were more options in the main restaurant, but quieter in the lounge. The lounge still had an omelet station. Food was excellent in all cases. The lounge also had happy hour snacks and offered a different veg / non-veg option each day.RestaurantsThe main restaurant had great food --- the pastas could not be beat. Most everything on their menu was also available by room service. The Indian Restaurant on the top floor was also excellent with great views.Concierge / Travel DeskThis was the one area that disappointed me --- I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted, and didn't get many suggestions. It seemed the staff was hesitant to help me.Shops Lots of options in the hotel iteself at many price points and all willing to bargain. I found the best options and service in jewelry from Manoj at Padma Gems (I forget which, but either suite 13 or 14). He even did a custom pendant for me! "
le meridien new delhi ,"Typical Le Meridien... We spent our Eid holidays in India and flew into Delhi from Dubai to commence our Golden Triangle tour. The exterior of the Le Meridien Hotel was quite dated but the interior was reasonably renovated. The lobby and rooms resemble the Le Meridien style, but since it is an old building many parts including the upper floor restaurants are tired looking.Check-in and check-out was slow and service level was generally poor, but after staying in other 5-star hotels in Jaipur and Agra I guess it's best to simply lower your expectations. A few incidents that annoyed me include:a. I was specifically asked my check-out time during check-in but received a subsequent call during my nap to ask exactly the same question;b. I called to arrange for a wake-up call at 6:15am and they called back 5 mins later confirming that it's 5:45am;c. No complimentary water in the room (again typical Le Meridien);d. At check-out, the front desk staff handed me my bill in an envelop without looking at me or saying &quot;Thank you for staying with us etc&quot;. I thought that was extremely rude.On the plus side, the room was very clean and comfortable. Also the food quality was great. We tried 2 restaurants and room service and were content with the standard.Location of the hotel is also an advantage as it is very close to the central attractions.Overall quite a decent accommodation. "
le meridien new delhi ,"great hotel This was my 5th stay at the hotel, and I enjoyed this stay as much as the previous times.I was picked up at the airport, my room rate included airport transfers. I was offered cold towel as well as bottled water.Check in was smooth at the Starwood Preffered Guest desk (I am a gold member).The room was on the 16th floor, with a nice view of India Gate.The room itself was nice with a 42&quot; plasma screen, desk, armchair and complimentary water as well as a bottle of wine (decent as well!)They are revamping the lobby floor at the moment, the Brasserie will be modernised as well as the Eau bar. I was told it will be finished in a few weeks.The Indian restaurant on the 1st floor is excellent, I asked the waitress to suggest some local indian dishes and it was fantastic.Service is top notch at this hotel. The price in August is correct, but it can get ridiculously expensive in high season. But this is a common trend in India these days. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Nice but spend extra money for The Imperial After two largely unsuccessful Delhi stays, I decided to spend my third stay at five-star hotels. I sprang for The Imperial the first night, and used my credit card rewards to get the Meridien room the second night. This is a nice hotel, my room was modern and clean, had a large TV and cool lights, bathroom fixtures, etc. The shower was excellent, and had hot water whenever I tried it. I ordered a mediocre cheeseburger (beef, finally!) from room service for lunch and went to their bistro restaurant for dinner, where I had an excellent roghan josh and a cocktail, all reasonably priced. The minibar was fairly cheap, so I sprang for a few things. For some reason, they gave me a complimentary bottle of wine with the room, which I found more than quaffable. The bed was comfortable, and I slept well. Both the alarm and a wake up call woke me up as planned in the morning. Their workout room is small, but I was able to get a treadmill run in. The bad: checkout took 15 minutes for some reason, despite my being in a hurry to catch my flight. This is unacceptable at such an expensive hotel. Indeed, check-in took some time, I stood directly in front of the desk for 3-4 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me, which was irritating. The restaurant options are unimpressive, they're adequate, but I was expecting more from a 5-star hotel. Finally, while I had an enjoyable stay, this hotel really is astonishingly pricey for what you get... a pretty ordinary room that would be perhaps $120 in the US. You're unlikely to be unhappy with your stay, but I recommend paying the extra $50 and staying at The Imperial or Orberoi; you will see where the extra money goes. "

le meridien new delhi ,Loved the bedroom I had one night to spend in Delhi before making a flight back to London and fancied some luxury. I thought the room was very impressive and I felt nice and relaxed here which is just what I needed. Loved the different colour schemes you could select the lights to change to. Bathroom was all mosaic tiled. Would definitely return to this hotel if I was in Delhi again and was splashing out on a 5* 
le meridien new delhi ,"Classy Contempory!! Slept Well It was great experience after long flight, good airport welcome and convinient drive to hotel. Very classy good room size and comfortable bed. It was my sheer luck that Olympic torch was at this hotel..felt great and proud to see it. Cause of extra security there were little restrictions but every where saw Olympic environment. I am a sports lover so enjoyed. Got choice of pillow which was exceptionally good and interesting so had sound sleep both the days.Room service was good but chinese restaurant was not operational.Would feel its grreat value for money..will stay again "
le meridien new delhi ,"Shangri-La next door is much better! Mostly a business hotel--looks like an old-style Embassy Suites. (you know--atrium style with walkways around to the rooms). It's quite intimidating if you're afraid of heights. The hotel interior is very dark. The gym is small, poorly equipped. But it is supposedly temporary. However, it's also not open when most business travelers can use it. (7:00 am - 8:00 pm during my stay).The room itself is bright enough, and clean. No bathtub, shower only. Mediocre food, mediocre service, no decent fitness facility--all of this for a mere $450 per night. "
le meridien new delhi ,"A Hotel without a Soul I booked my room through spg.com as a Gold member. Room charges across all level are sky high these days as it is being peak season in Delhi. Since, I booked a club room airport transfers both ways were. A driver with my name on paging board was waiting at airport on arrival hence the start was good. At the hotel, the lobby was like a huge hall at extreme end of which was the reception desk. To my mind not a very nice design. At reception, I was greeted by a staff called Mayank who asked me if I was tired. As I had a long flight with transfer connection in between I said yes I was. Once I finished check-in formaility the staff concerned said that rooms were occupied as it was early morning and I would have to wait for a few hours. However, he would offer a room if I agreed to pay previous night room charges. And it was around 7am in the morning! Although I requested for early check-in when I made the booking but the staff at reception refused to budge showing the policy of the hotel. When I asked if I could go up to the Club lounge and wait he said it would not be possible until I was allocated a room. After an hour long wait in the lobby when I finally got into my room #1215 I was greeted with strong smell of tobacco smoke although I requested for non-smoking room. Immediately I called the front desk and reported my displeasure and insisted in a room change. But the answer was a flat 'no'. The explanation was that the rooms had wooden flooring hence all rooms had smoking facility. I just could not believe my ears. When most of the reputable hotels worldwide are switching to 'no smoking' policy here is one which has turned into 'full smoking'. As it was a short stay for just one night I would not make further comments about room decor, mood lighting (did not live up to my taste), bathroom (without a bathtub), room service, lounge service, etc. In one word they were all very mediocre. Delhi has some excellent hotels, like, Taj Mahal, Oberoi, Taj Palace, to name a few, this one should be placed right at the bottyom of the list of 5 star hotels in the Indian capital. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Good Business Hotel This hotel is part of the Starwood chain of hotels. It is a clean, modern hotel right in the centre of Delhi within walking distance of India Gate, the Indian Government Complex and Connaught Place. The rooms are modern , spaceous, clean and well equipped. There are 20 floors and all look down on an inner court yard. Don't have a room on the top floors if you are afraid of hights The look over the rails into the courtyard is frightening!As an aside, don't call the Starwood 1-800 number if you want to arrange a pick up from the airport. The operator asked me which country Delhi was in and recommended to pick up a phone at the airport upn arrival. Now, if you have ever been to Indira Ghandi International, you know that there is no phone. Phone the hotel and arrange for the pick up and they send a driver, and it's free. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Mediocre Meridien Outrageously expensive and mediocre in process.How easy it is in business to make ammends - but only if everyone in your team is empowered to do so. Le Meridien staff are there to look after the interests of the hotel first, and the guests only where they fit within the rules.A poor result from the start, and not getting better.- Car booked for airport - but not on the list. One was organised in due course, but an ominous start.- Smoky room with two beds. Switched to non-smoky room with two beds.- Phenomenally noisy - street noise and neighbouring room noise - TV, Kids. Room itself is noisy.- Broadband is really a trickle - less than dial-up speeds at 4:00 AM- No end of stairs - constantly going up and down. Lifts don't seem to go where you want them to.- On a positive note, the Indian Restaurant was fabulous - though the waiter ensured we ordered far far more than we could eat.We're due to come back to Delhi in December - but not to this hotel. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Good hotel but not without problems The reviews of this hotel are pretty polarised. Most people either love it or hate it. I stayed there with my partenr for 4 nights over New Year and my opinions were a bit more mixed.Firstly the building is impressive if you like the atrium type of design. The location is a bit deceptive. It is actually only about 15 minutes walk as the crow flies to Connaught Place but there are some tricky road crossings and roundabouts to negotiate, particularly during rush hour. Plus a lot of extremely persistent rickshaw drivers, beggars and touts directly outside the hotel.The first problem however arose when checking in. I booked through expedia at a rate of 7877 rupees a night but when I checked in the girl said the room charge would be 9000 rupees a night, citing the usual scam about my rate not including taxes (even though my reservation printout clearly stated that taxes were included) As it was 2 o'clock in the morning I couldn't be bothered to argue and to their credit when I checked out I was charged the exact rate I had been quoted with expedia.Having stayed in Delhi before and knowing the traffic noise I asked for a room as high up as possible. We were given a club room on the 16th floor but the same person neglected to tell us we had been gicen a club room so we were not able to take advantage of the club privelages.The club rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished (the mood lighting will not be to everyones taste though). The bathroom was also great.The service and food and drink standards were excellent. Most of the negative points apply to expensive hotels just about anywhere but particularly India.Firstly you feel a bit like a cash dispenser, dealing out tips right, left and centre for the smallest of services, many of them unsolicited or even un wanted. Even though we were out alll day the housekeeping guy insisted on waiting until we got back to our room before he came to the room to replenish the soap in the bathroom etc - in a ridiculously transparent attempt to solicit a tip. This sort of stuff is annoying in the extreme.Other gripes. Even though it is winter the daytime temperature in Delhi was about 23 deg C. After the madness of Delhi it would have been nice to sit in the sun and take a drink on the terrcae. However the location of the pool means that the terrace is almost constantly in the shade and the pool is little more than a pigeon toilet.Another problem is that the hotel doesn't have a proper bar. A real bar is the life and soul of a decent hotel. Le Meridien has a room on the top floor which they call Henri's bar but it is not really a bar - it is just a room where they serve drinks. The place on the ground floor of the atrium where the bar should be in any hotel with self respect sells ....... cakes.This points up the major problem with this hotel.It does not seem to care much about its residents. It is much more interested selling expensive dinners and shows to rich Delhites than catering to the needs of its residents. This was illustrated clearly on New Years Eve. As we were flying to Kerala early on New Years Day we had planned to have a quiet meal and a few drinks. However EVERY restaurant in the hotel had some special NY function with a cover charge of 2500 to 8000 rupees a head, and all except the brasserie were fully booked anyway. The excuse for a bar was closed completely as it was rented out for a private function so we spent New Years Eve watching King Kong in our rooms with some very expensive room service. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Worst Hotel Ever Even for India, this hotel was disgraceful. Throughout my trip I stayed in pretty much all levels of hotels because of availability in the locations visited, so I experienced some pretty basic accommodations. Nothing was as bad as this hotel -- especially given the cost and the purported 5 star rating.The rooms were small and dark. The lights were controllable from a small bedside console with no instructions. The lights could not be made bright enough to actually see in the rooms unless the shades were open in broad daylight. Putting on makeup was impossible. On the flip side,there was a hardwired permanent night light in the bathroom and on the floorboard of the room. Even the engineer sent by the hotel after complaint was unable to disable this. It was too bright to sleep. The thermostat in the room could not be adjusted despite the appearance of dials and controls. The room was freezing and management offered a space heater as a solution. They admitted that the guests were unable ot adjust the temperature of rooms -- only fan speed.The automated wake up call service did not work. The desk offered me a wake up call and complementary am coffee to smooth over my dissatisfaction at being unable to sleep. The wake up call never came. The coffee -- cold -- arrived about 10 minutes late with a knock on the door. Then it appeared on my bill and a major conference with the Hotel manager was necessary to remove it from the bill. The key was deactivated at least 5 times in a 24 hour stay. Each time i was told it was because of being in the same pocket with my cellphone (it wasn't). This experience was duplicated by all 25+ people in my travellng party -- as was the room lights and air conditioning situation.There are more complaints i could list. This hotel is very expensive and no better than a Motel 6. It is decorated in garish ersatz boutique hotel style. At the elevators at every floor there is a giant tv running continuous loops of Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons.I never write reviews but this atrocity deserves to be revealed. Especially since the cheapest room starts at $450/night. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Best Deal in India I stayed at Le Meridien Delhi for two nights in December 2007. This place was first rate from the get go. I used the hotel airport transfer service which cost about $30 (US). I was greeted at the International terminal without any trouble even though my flight was 2 hours late. The driver was dressed all in white with white gloves. He took my luggage and led me to the hotel car which was a Toyota Camry (very nice by Indian standards). He gave me an ice cold bottled water and wet towel to wipe my face and hands. After a 15 hour oflight, this was so worth the $30. The hotel is very modern. My guess is that it was completely redone relatively recently. I booked directly through starwood's spg site. I was upgraded to a club level room for no extra charge which included a private lounge which served breakfast every day and drinks and appetizers in the evenings. Also had two computer terminals fr free use. The room was all wood (walls, floors) but very modern. Plasma tv, control panel for everything (a/c, tv, lights, etc) right next to the bed. Bathroom was finished with mosaic tile and high end fixtures. Best feature of all were the slippers which were the nicest hotel slippers I have ever received. The service was great. All staff greeted me by name. No problems at all. The best part was that I got all of this for $206 (US). In Delhi, that's a steal. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Never again... awful! I am a regular traveller to India so I've re-set my standards very low and typically go to Indian hotels expecting to be mis-treated, abused, overcharged, etc. I must congratulate the Le Meridien Delhi for finding several new and interesting ways to upset a guest... and to make sure they never return. Check in was slow but not interminable. Credit to the young lady who checked me in, she did have a decent attitude. Room was dark and quite small. This is an atrium style hotel so there is noise in the room both from the street and from the atrium.Food in the hotel was lousy. Fish in the top floor restaurant left me with a 3 day case of Delhi Belly. The gym was small with one off-brand elliptical machine, one old stairclimber, one bicycle, and 3 treadmills, of which only one seemed to function. Gym normally opens at 7 or 8 so I asked for it to be opened at 5 which is my normal exercise time, but I failed to ask for it to be open, with the power turned on, with the air-con on, and with the remote available for the TV, so on successive days at least 2 of these were not available and no-one in the hotel seemed to understand!The new and interesting event was that one night at 2:30 in the morning my doorbell rang... and rang again... and again. I kept checking, but noone was there! Soon it was ringing nearly constantly It took about 30 minutes for the hotel to respond to my calls and finally they fixed it by just disconnecting it, saying it must be a short in the wire! If this is how poorly the hotel is wired, what fire hazards also exist?Through all of this there was no apology, no acknowledgement, and when I asked upon check-out to speak with the hotel GM, the staff refused to pass along his name, email address, nor contact details. Bottom line is that for $445 you can find something in Delhi that will only upset you in the customary ways that anyone who travels frequently in India is now used to... no need for all of these new annoyances! "
le meridien new delhi ,"5* looks no stars for service I'll start by saying that we were going to start our honeymoon in this hotel - but to finish it here was the worst possible way to end the holiday of a lifetime. Thank God we stayed in The Claridges instead for the first couple of nights.The service is abysmal in the restaurant and at the front desk. In the La Brasserie, my wife and I got fed up with the looks of disdain and the nonchalant attitude towards the service we were given. Emphasis was definitely on clearing the table as quickly as possible. We were even greeted by the duty manager with a stare until he forced a hello out of us - but we got nothing back!The rooms and the hotel itself were amazing and the service provided by the bar staff and the room attendants was typically Indian in terms of courtesy - absolutely wonderful. We were going to forgive the hotel the idiots who work in the restaurant (although that in the Pakwan restaurant was pretty decent but a little on the cold side) until we checked out. Notwithstanding the fact that the idiot on reception seemed to be put out by our wanting to check out and the complete absence of any eye contact or courtesy, as we were getting more and more irate by his behaviour, a representative from the hotel asked us to complete a feedback form. When my wife explained to her that we were in a rush and had our travel agent representative waiting to escort us back to the airport, she slapped the form down on the desk and repeated her request, which by this stage was more of an order. All of this was witnessed by the rep, who himself was gobsmacked and mentioned that his very reputable international company were looking at their arrangement with Le Meridien.The door staff were amazingly polite to us on our way out but we were so p-ed off with the idiotic members of staff we had endured that we just wanted to get out of there as soon as we could.You may find that you like the service but I promise you it is not in the same league as The Claridges in New Delhi nor any other hotel run by an Indian company (Taj, Oberoi, etc.). Oh, and one more thing - in spite of having very nice polite and friendly staff, the outdoor swimming pool is a glorified pigeon bath caked in pigeon poo - no joke! "
le meridien new delhi ,"Great service! Just accompanied my husband on a business trip to Delhi-this was my first time in India and I didn't have too much information on what to expect, but I must say that the level of service received in this hotel made my trip very enjoyable.I was struck by the high quality of customer service here-everyone bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we needed.We also had dinner one night in the Pakwan restaurant which was delicious.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. "
le meridien new delhi ,"5 Star all the way Both myself and mywife stayed here at the end of September for 2 nights.Check in was efficient and friendly.The room, (a suite) was fantastic, with the attention to detail evident.The service was second to none, including all the restaurants, toliets, room service and club lounge.The location is also very central, merely a ten minute walk to Connaught Place.Couldn't fault the place - highly recommended, (but not cheap!!) "
le meridien new delhi ,"Loved Delhi Le Meridien We don't know what everyone is complaining about. We're Americans, and this was our first stay in India. This was an awesome hotel! Everything was great - the food, breakfast, the rooms - even the shops were cool. Service was excellent. The bath was very nice - I only wish I had that setup in my place at home. Would DEFINITELY stay again - above average, bordering on excellent. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Not worth the Five star status! I had heard many good things about Le Meridian from some family members, so I decided to book it. The rate I got was very good, and it was via Expedia.com. Checking into the hotel wasnt a problem. Our luggage was promptly brought up by the bellman, and the front desk check in went fine. The Lobby of the hotel is very spacious and nicely decorated.The room had ample space, had wood floors, a nice size bathroom with mosaic tiles on the walls and floors, a large plasma/LCD television, and a nice view of the city. Seemed very good! The first problem that arised was that first night. The power went off about 2-3 times for about 5 minutes each time, leaving us in total darkness while unpacking etc. Not a good way to start a vacation after a 14 hour flight.The other problem we encountered was small, but became VERY annoying. The wood floors creaked very very loud in some areas when steping on them. If I went to the bathroom at night and stepped on that spot, my wife would wake up startled! So had to tippie toe and avoid those areas.The electricity in the entire room only works when you put your room key in a slot as you enter. So if you want a light during the night time hours, you have to leave the entire room light! Can't pick and choose which lights to keep on or off. The thing that bothered and annoyned me the most was about my room rate. Apparently, Le Meridian changed their tax structure starting September 1st. They told me that due to this, I have to pay an additional $210 US for the night of 9/1. I fought this very strongly and said that Expedia did not have this charge listed, and if there was miscommunication between Le Meridian and Expedia, that I would not be responsible for it. I was then contacted about this matter THREE TIMES! I then got Expedia on the phone, told them the situation, and the manager at Expedia spoke to Le Meridian, and they agreed that I would not be charged any extra.What was funny thought, when we were checking out, I overheard them doing the same thing to every other guest! And EVERY one of the guests refused to pay. Should be an interesting month for them...The last thing that irked me about this place was the front desk staff. They are CLUELESS as to the on goings of their OWN hotel! I called and asked the hours of a restraurant, and was told they open at 12 noon. I waited for an hour for it to open, only to find out it really opens at 12:30! On a sunday I asked if the shops on the second floor were open, and was told no, all shops are closed on Sunday. But lo and behold! ALL of them were open! At one point my wife and I were in the mood of a certain Indian dish, and we were told that coffee shop had it (which confused me). When we proceeded to the coffee shop, all we saw were cakes and pastries. When I asked them, I got a strange look and the obvious answer.So...if you need to find anything out, DO NOT ask the front desk, call the restaurant/store directly! Overall....I had heard great things about this hotel, but after this past week, I feel that it is VERY overrated. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was nice, but the customer service was NILL!! I would recommend to stay at the Muria Sheraton or Taj instead. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Nice hotel We stayed 2 nights at the beginning of our Rajahstan tour and one night at the end of it. First two nights were in a suite, still not renovated but fine anyway. The only problem was with the A/C just above our bed with the following dilemma : keeping it open and freezing or shutting it off and boiling ... surprising for a 5* hotel ! Nice view on Delhi but could have been better if the windows had been washed. We spent the last night in a renovated room (A/C at the entry of the room, so problem fixed ...). Nice design with a blue or yellow light wall behind the bed. The only problem was that our room was just next the rooms being currently in the process to be renovated ... so forget about relaxing till 6 pm. Staff not particularily smiling. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Good hotel in central New Delhi We have just returned from 8 days at Le Meridien New Delhi. Apparently ther hotel has quite recently been taken over by Meridien and is still undergoing some refurbishment.We booked a Royal Club room which included 2 way airport transfers. We were met at the airport and promptly driven to the hotel.The driver was charming and offered us bottles of water as well as a commentary as we approached central delhi. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in very quickly and courteously at the royal club desk and taken straight to our room.The room was not the biggest we have stayed in but it was very nicely furnished with mood lighting,plasma tv and mini bar( soft drinks and just one bottle of kingfisher beer).There was a bottle of wine and a bowl of fruit in the room on arrival( the fruit wasnt changed though which meant we had to throw out the apples we didnt eat after 4 days......in other meridien hotels fruit has been changed daily if not eaten).The room was serviced twice daily and even the bathrobes( which were very skimpy) were changed daily.The club lounge was very comfortable but a little dark as it had no windows being in the centre of the hotel. Breakfast was excellent and served from 7am until 10am ( 11am on sundays).High tea was served between 3pm and 5pm...this consisted of a selection of hot and cold snacks which were different everyday.Unfortunately, i made the mistake of eating a canape with mayonnaise on the day before we left and subsequently developed a severe case of ' delhi belly' which made me very ill, so beware.Between 6pm and 8pm alcohol was served and also more snacks, either vegetarian or non vegetarian. They were delicious and changed each evening.The club lounge staff were all very charming though one or two were sometimes more interested in watching cricket or surfing the internet than serving.Our only real complaint was that the lounge was often busy with very loud business people conducting business. We appreciated this was a business hotel but the lounge is provided for club guests as a place of comfort away from the main hotel. The last thing we wanted were loud business people in there conducting their meetings on the phone or in person.We ate in La Brassiere restaurant a few times....this was very good and very reasonable. Henri's bar was also a pleasant spot for a drink with great views from the 20th floor.However, this was also closed for 2 days due to meetings being held there.The pool area is located on the 4th floor. This was very disappointing.The biggest problem was that the concrete surrounding the pool was covered in bird droppings and there were at least 20 pigeons bathing and drinking from the pool when we decided to go down for some sun and a swim. Needless to say we didnt venture in.We did mention this to one of the sales and marketing team who came to speak to us one evening in the club lounge. He explained that the pool area had not yet been refurbished........this is no reason for not keeping it clean!The hotel was well situated for Connaught place and all the sights in New and Old Delhi. There are auotrickshaws and taxis in abundance but they will all try to ' rip you off '. One rickshaw driver even told us it is the norm to overcharge tourists.We hired a car and driver via Expedia and this was definitely the best way to see Delhi.I would recommend staying at this hotel as the location is good as long as you are not expecting the same standards as say Dubai, London or Bangkok.Just a few other things.........in addition to your room rate and the 12.5% luxury tax you will also be charged another 5% on 12.5% of the room rate.( at least i think thats what it meant on the bill)...we couldnt quite figure out why and to be honest i was so ill as we departed we could even be bothered to ask.Also, you will be charged tax on all your food and your drinks so the base price on the menu is not the price you will pay,. This can be quite a shock if you arent prepared for it. Fortunately we were. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Surprisingly nice....... When a business partner suggested we stay at Le Meridien for 2 nights last week, I was not that thrilled. I have never stayed there but having lived in Delhi in the late 90s, I had frequented their public areas and restaurants and had not been impressed. My first surprise was to see that the Le Meridien group is now part of Starwood Hotels. As a Starwood Preferred Guest, I was ushered to a special desk and checked in quickly. The room was the next surprise. In place of the usual carpet that retains the flavours - pleasant and unpleasant - of the previous six guests, there was a wooden floor. LCD TV on the wall, very nice appointments all round and an extremely pleasant bathroom with a shower mounted directly overhead as well as a &quot;telephone&quot; type shower. Climate control was excellent and could be carried out from a bedside console. Breakfast was varied and extensive and a very nice light supper before departing for the airport rounded off my stay. I had asked for late checkout till 8 pm. Again, I was most pleasantly surprised to be told that there would be no charge if I stayed till 6 pm (most generous) and half day charge till 8 pm. I readily accepted as it allowed for a shower and change of clothes before heading for the airport. The one downside of my stay was checkout - the clerk handling it made several mistakes and was slow. Coupled with its great location, I would return to Le Meridien, New Delhi the next time. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Fantastic hotel We stayed here for 9 nights in a Le Club room. The hotel is amazing, very clean, modern and in a pretty good location (10 minute stroll to Connaught place). The staff are very attentive and when we did have a small problem we were seen by a hotel director who did absolutely everything and more to keep us happy. Surely the sign of a good hotel is how well they rectify problems... the Le Med were 100% brilliant.We ate in the hotel restaurants a couple of times following late arrivals from trips and found the food to be varied, very well cooked and presented and not to pricey...certainly compared to European prices.The pool area was a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of City life and enjoys stunning views. Beds and towels are provided.The rooms are well sized and ours had mood lighting, a large wall mounted plasma t.v, mini bar, climate control, safe and a super bathroom with waterfall shower.All in all we can thouroughly recommend this hotel and it rates as one of the best we have stayed in ( and we've stayed in hundreds!!!!) "
le meridien new delhi ,"Bad Decor Great Location After a less than satisfying stay at the Hotel Nikko, I decided to end my trip to India in a more conveniently located hotel. The Le Meridien was perfect. It was very easy to walk to Connaught Pl, the Cottage Industries, the Presidential Residence, and the Central Museum. Plus, while there were a few beggars and hawkers (as must be expected), they were not overwhelming. I felt very safe.The hotel itself had very large rooms and the breakfast I had was decent. Also, I ate in the Indian restaurant and enjoyed it. My only beef with the joint is that the decor is weird and alienating. Too weirdly modern. Still, I would stay there again. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Better than expected Having read all the negative reviews, I was prepared to be disappointed but, in fact, the Meridien was a very nice hotel. The rooms were large and well appointed, the restaurants in the hotel were good and the location was excellent. Particularly liked the excellent showers and the plasma screen tvs. Didn't much care for the mood lighting but that is a small point. I would recommend the Meridien to anyone going to Delhi. "
le meridien new delhi ,"5* luxury! After completing a tour of India we spent our last night at this hotel. It was great to have a comfortable bed, a hot power shower and good quality food. The hotel has the usual Meridien corporate fixtures and fittings which you can see in any Meridien hotel the world over! But after spending some time touring India this was the perfect hotel to relax in before flying back to the UK!The hotel is also in an excellent location in New Delhi, close to major sites. "
le meridien new delhi ,Really nice! I am surprised at some of the comments that have been left. Yes the Merdian is a bit pricey but the hotel is really nice and the rooms were clean. The service was excellent. The buffet breakfast that is included in your stay is really great! A lot to choose from. The staff is extremely helpful and it is buzzing with people all the time. It is walking minutes from the central shopping areas. I stayed for 5 days and loved it. It was a comfortable stay indeed! 
le meridien new delhi ,"It was OK for a one night stay I feel compelled to write a review simply because I stayed here for one night in November 2006 despite some of the recent negative reviews. I'm not a particularly fussy traveller and didn't have high expectations for this hotel based on the reviews.Was met by a hotel driver at Delhi airport. He did try to persuade me to go shopping before I got to the hotel, but a simple &quot;no thank you&quot; was enough. He was polite and very talkative.Selected a Club level room. The room was fine - nothing particularly special but comfortable and certainly large enough. Bathroom was unappealing but enjoyed the rain shower. Toiletries were standard. My main gripe was that I could hear loud music in the room until quite late when I was trying to get some much needed sleep. The Club breakfast was fine, with very good service. I'm not a picky eater so I found enough there for a filling breakfast.I found the staff overall to be quite pleasant. The lobby wasn't really to my taste and I think overall the hotel lacked a certain atmosphere. It wasn't a luxury retreat from the hustle and bustle of Delhi although I wasn't really expecting this.I have to say that this hotel is quite unremarkable and given the price it was poor value for money. However, it served its purpose for one night. The best thing I could say is that it's not as bad as some of the previous reviews suggest. I wouldn't return here even though there was nothing particularly bad about this hotel. I stayed here due to a Starwood promotion otherwise I can think of better options in Delhi for around the same price. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Excellent hotel Brilliant hotel, modern with first class facilities. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great rooms and fabulous food. The spa area was particularly good - would highly recommend this hotel "
le meridien new delhi ,"First the good news I’ve been stewing about this hotel since my last stay in November of 2005.I’ll start by saying that I’ve stayed at the Le Meridien New Delhi twice now and overall was happy with my stays. The rooms are very nice if just a bit cold in a “post modern” way. I stayed on the club floor and I like the beds, bathroom and the nice mood light thing at the head of the bed.The lobby restaurant was good as far as lobby restaurants go and the Chinese restaurant was outstanding. The snacks in the club lounge are nothing special but the service was very friendly and good as was most of the other staff at the hotel. Here is the big but. On departure from the hotel a hotel car took me to the airport with a uniformed Le Meridien driver. Before we were down the driveway he (not so subtlety) started hitting me up for money. I’m no stranger to 3rd world countries having traveled to them routinely for the last 25 years but when he took a detour down a dark street to show me his horrible apartment I got really concerned. After I refused to get out of the car he finally relented and took me on to the airport. Once there I handed him a sizeable tip (happy to be getting away) but it was apparently not enough so he followed me right up to the terminal doors starched white suit and all.I sent Le Meridien e-mails about this incident but I never got a reply. I will be in Delhi again next month but this time at the Taj. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Dissappointing We had booked two rooms at this hotel for four nights. We were overcharged for the rooms from the rate quoted at the time of booking.Then later on the charged us more stating that the rate given at the time of checking in was for single occupancy and there were two of us stating in the room.Well when four people are standing in front of you it is amply clear that there are going to be two people staying the room!The breakfast is nothing to talk about, and i can say the same about food there in general.This hotel is a text book case of how you can't make a hotel good by having just a good location, modern rooms and newly renovated lobby. The people who manage is what makes the great.Overall the attituted of the staff was of being uninterested to down right ignorant and arrogant. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Average Nice hotel. However, for USD300/night for a club room, it is not very value for money. The brekkie on the club floor is not much to crow about. The room is quite nice though, although the design is a tad too modern for my liking. The flooring could have been carpeted for better effect. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Worst Le meridian I’ve stayed at. Depressing, gloomy, and dirty. We stayed there for 3 nights and it was just awful. I wouldn’t stay there ever again, and to be honest I don’t think I’ll ever go to Delhi ever again either. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Worst Value in Delhi Where to begin? I booked a $170 club level, non-smoking room. When I arrived, I was informed that there were no non-smoking club level rooms available. So I was placed in a regular room ... at the club level price. No negotiation.Then there was the construction. Currently, the hotel is undergoing renovation, and construction lasts until 9 or 9:30 depending upon who you ask. Regardless, if you like listening to drill and hammers until 9:30 at night, this is the hotel for you. When I complained, the staff offered to move me to a room that is out of earshot of the construction. When I complained to the duty manager, then the manager, I received no reply. Customer comfort is not important to the staff here.Finally, I was appalled to find the the hotel gym is smaller than my room. Three running machines, an exercise bike, and a weight set. That's it. Oh, and the pool was closed.STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! I have visited 29 countries, and this is the worst so-called &quot;luxury hotel&quot; experience that I have ever had. THE WORST. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Freezing! We were booked into stay at one of the 2 bedroom suites - my brother, his wife, my wife and I - for USD750per night (brekkie included) it was extremely average - huge! but straight out of the 80's. Was also cold!! - no heating. When I asked reception and the hotel manager they claimed that none of the 5 star hotels in New Delhi were centrally heated - I found this very surprising! In any case after complaining about how disappointed we were they moved us to the recently renovated wing in the hotel but into two separate suites - very nice club suites indeed - plasma screens, polished floorboards, sep lounge, huge bathroom. But again no heating! - but for some reason the rooms seemed warmer - I figured probably because they were on the side of the hotel that got the sun! - they did give us a couple of small electric heaters!The bathroom - first shower my wife had the drain got clogged and I had to call maintenance!Overall - quite disappointed given what we were paying!! "
le meridien new delhi ,"a little stark but very nice spent two nights in Le Mer, New Delhi, then away for five days and back for two more nights. Lobby is very stark, simplistic, New Age. rooms are spartan, but nice: hardwood floors, shimmery tile in baths, sparse furniture, good electronic outputs/inputs (42 inch flat screen TV for World Cup games !!) breakfast buffet (in fact all meals in 24-hour coffee shop) was very nice. a little NON-western....where's my crisp bacon ? ... but excellent service and variety. staff was superb. had a burnt out light bulb....called downstairs, replaced in 10 minutes. "
le meridien new delhi ,"Excellent hotel! This is a modern, comfortable large hotel. It is very well situated. The lobby is huge, very contemporary, always busy. The rooms are very well designed, with all the mod cons. The service is excellent. The breakfast is fine - not amazing.The Indian restaurant is absolutely brilliant. Much, much better than the ridiculously touristic, over priced, hugely over rated Sehraton's Bukhara. And much cheaper, too!We loved the light wooden floors, the comfy slippers, the central control console next to the bed, the large plasma TV and the well equipped mini bar. There is no bath yub, just a shower, but a very nice one! One complaint would be, that it ws not possible to change the room temperature, which, albeit airconditioned, was not as cool as we like it. Having said that - it was quite pleasant. Thr Business Club is nicely done but too dark for our liking. Some more lights there would be nice.If you like character and old world feel, and price is no issue, choose the Oriental. If you like contemporary &quot;business like&quot; hotel - choose Le Meridien. "

maharani guesthouse ,Very nice and quaint This is a very nicely maintained and conveniently located guest house...the biryani and the butter chicken here rocks.... 
maharani guesthouse ,Okay but that's al Okay but when I arrived they didn't seem to have to my booking and we had negotiate for what I thought we already had. Be careful. 
maharani guesthouse ,"There's better available for Cheaper I stayed here for 3 days for a business trip. It is definitely well located on near Mathura Road, however, that's were all positives of the place ends. The forst shock after seeing the place was that they were charging Rs. 4,500 / per night. As if that was not all, for some reason they refused to accept card payments (this may have been a temporary problem, in all fairness). There is no alcohol available in the place, but a waiter will get you one on Order and some commission. The food in room service was terrible. Rooms were just decently hygenic and not really as clean as one would prefer. Staff is helpful in all commercial services asked for, but courtsey is another matter altogether. My conclusion was that for this money, I know of better places. Avoid. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Terrible! We travelled from Delhi to Rajasthan to Goa &amp; back to Delhi so had taken a look around this hotel on our first visit to Delhi. We'd been shown a large clean room with a high standard of decor &amp; a marble bathroom...but on that occasion we didn't stay as we managed to negotiate an even better deal at (the normally twice the price) Jukaso Inn down the road. We decided to 'treat ourselves' on our last night of our world trip and booked the Maharani from Goa via email &amp; exchanged 3 emails confirming the booking &amp; giving our flight arrival times. When we arrived at the hotel at 7pm (the time we had indicated) we were told that we had arrived too late and that the hotel was full! They also denied having received our emails despite having replied to them. We were not too pleased as we were leaving at 4am the following morning. The manager said he would see what he could do &amp; we were left sitting in the lobby for over half an hour while he avoided our gaze &amp; dealt with other enquires. We asked what was going on &amp; he said he was waiting for a guest to leave who was on a late check out. After another half hour &amp; no update it transpired that this guest was in a restuarant with his wife &amp; was not due to be back until 11pm. When we (quite angrily by this stage) said we would not wait until 11pm he said he would find us a &quot;nice room in another sister hotel&quot;. I've travelled to India many times and know never to accept this offer! The sister hotel is usually a very poor standard yet they'll try to charge you the same rate. After another hour of arguing with this very arrogant man, we finally flipped &amp; resorted to pretending to be from a very important organisation &amp; saying how disappointed we were with the treatment &amp; that our organisation would not use the hotel again. His attitude changed immediately &amp; suddenly there was a room available. Unbelievable.HOWEVER...the room was right at the top of the hotel, was small and shabby with a disgusting bathroom and a hole in the bath. We tried to complain again but the manager had made a hasty retreat home by this point &amp; we were too tired to argue any more.So we were still charged £50 (which is a LOT of money in India) for a terrible room &amp; terrible service. Unfortunately this is a pretty standard experience in India. The hotel had also offered to pick us up from the airport for 850RPS. We declined &amp; took a police-approved prepaid taxi for 150RPS from the little booth at the airport. You don't mind a hotel charging you a little bit more...but 700RPS more??So - DON'T STAY HERE! If you're not on a budget stay at the Jukaso Inn and negotiate a good deal. If you are on a budget you'll be struggling as Delhi is not the place to find good, clean, cheap rooms. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Not so good the second time.... I returned to the Maharani Guest House for 3 nights after having stayed there in January 2006. At that time I posted a positive review on TripAdvisor. Upon my return to the Maharani I found that the tariff had increased considerably (now $75.00 + 12.5% tax for a single room). The desk clerk recognized me and asked the manager (who also recognized me) if he should offer the lower tariff I had paid in 2006. The manager quickly dismissed his request. Neither realized that I understood Hindi. I felt no reason to barter over the price since my visit was planned at the last minute and my previous stay had been good.I was given a very small room at the back of the hotel. It could be accessed by the lift or stairs from the lobby. The carpet in the room was disgustingly dirty and the walls were in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom was clean and the hot water was adequate.There was a writing desk in the already cramped room and I pulled open a drawer to locate the room service menu, only to be greeted by a rather large cockroach. I had never seen roaches in the hotel before and this was the only one I discovered in my room, but I will admit it made for a rather uncomfortable stay. I asked to change rooms but was told that was not possible as the hotel was full.The service was still a bit creepy, with housekeepers lurking around my door waiting for a tip and the afternoon desk clerk was still a bit condescending. The food was just as good as before and the prices had not changed. The location is great but I cannot recommend this hotel after my last stay. There are plenty of other hotels in New Delhi that are a better value for the money. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Not so good... After spending a few days in the Indian Islamic Cultural Center and the Crowne Plaza, we went around the Sundar Nagar to find a place to stay for the day before we go to the airport. The Jukasso Inn was really nice but also very expensive. We also went to the La Sagrita but I did not like it there. In the end, we decided to stay at the Maharani Guest House. The room is old and smells like chemicals. It does not look that clean too. I must however say that the location is really nice. However, I enjoyed the Lodhi area better because it was peaceful and the restaurant at the Indian Habitat Center is the best!If you have hired a car and a driver, I suggest you go find another place. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Good value for money with great location Stayed here a few months ago and found it to be good value for money. The location is very attractive and central. Rooms are clean and comfortable. People expecting all the amenities of a 5 star hotel will be dissapointed...note that this is a quaint guesthouse, and serves the purpose of a good nights sleep and some small snacks. Will recommend this place and stay again. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Decent hotel We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2007. Decent place for the price ($70). The location in Sundar Nagar is excellent and close to India Gate. But I recommend hiring a taxi all day (about Rs 1200) as most Indian cities are not great for walking, the traffic, dust and fumes are a bit overwhelming for my taste.The rooms are large (we had Double rooms) and the bathrooms are large/sufficiently clean.Be careful about the breakfast. I recommend masala omlette rather than the fixed breakfast menu. Avoid Orange juice and go for for well boiled coffee.For the first time travelled, I also discourage staying in Pahar Ganj, Karol Bagh or any old Delhi areas. Stay in New Delhi which is suprisingly clean and beautiful.Given the lack of decent hotels in New Delhi for under $100, I think Maharani is a good choice. They also arranged a car for the trip to airport (Rs 400). We arranged all day taxis on our own from Kumar Travels listed in Lonely Planet.The hotel has too many people on staff and they all expect a tip. When we asked for a towel at 1am, TWO people arrived with one towel and expected a tip ! On the way out, I counted about 10 people helping us load our bags in the taxi. I simply paid Rs 100 at the front desk to keep everyone happy. "
maharani guesthouse ,"Do Not Stay At This Place! We stayed at this hotel for three nights while we were in Delhi and would never stay here again. We arranged for airport pickup through the hotel and our driver took us on some scam diversion to a &quot;travel office&quot; where we urged to pay MORE money for our hotel even though we had already paid with a credit card. After this long diversion, we finally arrived at our hotel room to find that the bathroom was not clean--no need to go into details but I'll just say that it had been used before our arrival. The next morning we got up at 5:00 am to catch a train to Agra and almost fell over the staff who was sleeping in the hallway. It was bery clear that the staff sleeps lined up in the hallway every night. Enough said, DO NOT stay here! "
maharani guesthouse ,what a dump! i thought this hotel was a dive. really really over rated and over priced by 50% at least. for a little more money you can find a lot better than this dump. 
maidens hotel ,"Right Place to stay First hotel of twelve we stayed in on our trip to India. Set back from a busy road in its own grounds, it was a very nice place to stay for a couple of nights. We were upgraded to a suite which was clean, comfortable, with a beautiful bathroom. One of the best beds we slept in all holiday with great pillows. There are 2 restaurants, both of which served good food. If you don't like your curry too spicy the chef will happily tone it down for you. Good buffet breakfast. "
maidens hotel ,"thre are nicer places to stay in Delhi Don't confuse this hotel with the 'Oberoi Maidens'! The service at 'The Maidens' is not brilliant - very slow service in the restaurants/ garden bar. Staff almost seemed not to notice you were there. The indoor area of the garden restaurant was characterless. Our room was a decent enough size but did not have any windows so was very dark and a bit musty smelling. The local area is not one you want to walk around really - very smelly. We have stayed at Claridges before (much better accomodation and service, and in a much better area where you can walk around) and would go back there next time. "
maidens hotel ,"Garden oasis in rambling Delhi The maidens hotel is a great choice to stay in Delhi for people who like heritage hotels and enjoy gardens. Garden is huge and there is also a pool. Standard rooms are a bit uninspired, but provide all the amenities (central a/c, sat tv, big bathroom, comfy beds, minibar etc). The garden is the biggest asset of this hotel- which other hotel has a similarly big garden in delhi?? probably none. In my eyes, the hotel is fair value and the service is very good, very attentive and kind. I could be worthwile to opt for a superior room if you stay for honeymoon. Garden terrace restaurant is a lovely place to have dinner. Relax while staying in a bustling multimillion inhabitants metropole! "
maidens hotel ,Loved heritage property with good parking space in heart of Delhi with excellent ambience 
maidens hotel ,"An Oasis in Old Delhi The hotel looked beautiful on-line, but we weren't sure from some mixed reviews. This is the place to stay in Delhi! The staff are warm and attentive, the back garden and pool was like heaven after a crazy day on rickshaws and the beds are so comfortable. When we arrived they had even baked a cake for our honeymoon. Wild peacocks often sit on the back fence and overall you could not want more from a hotel. We loved The Maidens! "
maidens hotel ,"Beautiful interesting heritage hotel We arrived at the Maidens very late after they confused our airport pick-up. (I notice this happened to someone else recently....perhaps they should note the theme.) Once we arrived, they were very helpful, and they settled us into our comfortable rooms. We had a delicious breakfast buffet each morning, which was included in our room package. The pool was beautiful, and the gardens were amazing. While some travelers may perfer ultra-modern 5-star sleekness, I significantly prefer the lived-in and comfortable charm of the historic Maidens. Also, I'm sure you could not find friendlier staff or better service (aside from the airport problem.) Another great attribute of the Maidens is that it is located very close to the metro station, so there is no problem quickly getting around town.I highly recommend this hotel, and I will definitely go back whenever I have the opportunity to return to Delhi. "
maidens hotel ,"Old World Charm Things got off to a bad start when the hotel failed to send a car to pick us up from the airport as arranged. After enduring an hour taxi ride with a driver who got lost (and this using the pre-pay taxi stand in the airport!), we eventually got to the hotel. The first task was to actually convince the staff that we had booked a car at all! When they eventually checked their details and realised their mistake, they upgraded us to a suite which looked newly re-furbished. After this bad start, things got much better. The hotel is a vague throwback to a bygone age. A nice cold Kingfisher in the Cavalry Bar to take the edge off the heat of the day is a very acceptable way to spend time. The lunch buffet in the main restaurant is pretty basic and not worth the money - stick to eating in the terrace cafe. The staff were very friendly and very helpful and, when we stayed there again at the end of our holiday, they put us back in the same suite room at no extra cost. The room itself was quite modern with flat screen TV's in the bedroom and the living area and the biggest most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on. The bathroom was well appointed with a large walk in shower and a nice big bath. Everything was spotlessly clean and, after the early difficulty, it was a joy to stay here. "
maidens hotel ,"diasppointing I was all excited to enjoy this hotel, as it looks really nice from the pictures. And it actually may good potentials, if you do not mind being about 8 kms. from New Delhi. I decided to go all this way from New Delhi, but, it has been a disappointing experience. I was put into a room that had no windows, as the only source of natural light was a small window made of frosted glass that was giving to the corridor !!! As a moring surprise, I wanted to use the kettle and it did not work. "
maidens hotel ,"Terrible old rooms but wonderful new ones The superior rooms look terrible, without windows and not renovated. The better rooms are wonderful with old fashioned, beautiful bathrooms, and stylish decorated rooms with an extra living room. Complain, it's worth it!The breakfast's not bad, nothing special. The location in the north of delhi's ok, but it's actually better to stay in the south, closer to the centre. If you're planning to go to Agra with the train - highly recommended - than this is the right place for you, because it's not too far from the station and the train's leaving very early in the morning. "
maidens hotel ,"Comfortable elegant hotel We had booked superior rooms for our three day stay, (not sure why they're called superior as they were the cheapest rooms!), however we were delighted to be upgraded to deluxe suites, which were lovely; a huge bedroom with TV, ensuite luxury bathroom, and a large walk-in wardrobe as well as an even bigger lounge, with sofas, another TV, tea &amp; coffee facilities, minibar etc. All rooms had large windows, but with frosted glass, as they opened onto a wide communal veranda, but as the rooms were light and airy this did not bother us at all. The hotel dates back to the &quot;days of the Raj&quot; and is a lovely old white building, but the interior furnishings although very smart and plush and all immaculately clean were very &quot;corporate chain hotel&quot; style, no real flavour of India inside at all. However as we were to discover on the rest of our trip, traditional rajasthani beds are very hard, so the Maiden's well-sprung mattresses, crisp linen sheets and fluffy pillows were a luxury we missed later on! Travelling with two young teenagers we wanted to have a relaxing holiday as well as enjoying the cultural highlights, so throughout our trip we chose hotels with pools where possible. After a cold wet March in Kent and a long overnight flight, we enjoyed our first day in India relaxing in the hot sun by the Maidens hotel swimming pool. It was deserted apart from us, beautifully warm and clean and set in charming lush gardens. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly, helpful and welcoming. They helped us plan our excursions, arranged transfers and gave useful advice. We did not use the restaurant much as it was ridiculously expensive for India. Of course, big hotels do charge over the odds, but 4 burgers and cokes cost £40. When you have to rely on bottled water for all drinks and cleaning teeth we rather resented paying £1.50 a litre, when it was about 12p in the local shops. Having said that the food and service were both very good. "
maidens hotel ,"Lovely Old Hotel We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a custom tailored tour of India. We had a suite room which was very large, which included a double bed, 2 flat screen TVs, desk, couch, chairs, tables, huge walk-in closet, and huge bathroom. Amenities included robes, slippers, bath products and daily newspaper. Beautifully landscaped gardens and a large outdoor pool. The hotel has lots of security, both roaming and stationary. All cars are checked before entering hotel grounds. Our breakfast was included with the room each morning and was served in a small room overlooking the gardens. Breakfast included eggs cooked to order, toast, pastries, fresh fruit, juices, coffee and tea, and several local Indian dishes. While we were only in the hotel early mornings and late evenings, we thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and service. "
maidens hotel ,"A great choice in Old Delhi There are few places worth staying in Old Delhi but Oberoi Maidens is an exception. The staff were very accommodating in trying to organise an early check in for us and as a result we got one of the suites with a separate living space. The room is very well appointed, as is the bathroom with a separate walk in shower. We found the staff to be very helpful and loved the location of the hotel just minutes from the noise and bustle of Old Delhi. There is also a pool which offers a refuge when it all gets a bit too much. My only criticism is that the restaurant, though good, is incredibly expensive for India - and not that far off attaining London prices. "
maidens hotel ,"nice building very poor service Stayed for 3 nights in a suite in Febuary this year, we had windows, but poor view of the car park. the room was great, with lots of space, however the service at this hotel is terrible, reception staff dont seem to care, did not tell us when messages were left for us,the breakfast room is too small to cope with the number of guests trying to use it, we asked for lemon for tea, 3 times 3 different waiters and then it was taken to the wrong table. Room service took 90 minutes, an hour and a half to get a pizza, they said the kitchen burnt the first one, they just forgot to send it.we are going back to Delhi later this year, but wont be staying at the Maidens again. "
maidens hotel ,"Most rooms do not have windows! The Maidens Hotel is a lovely place, however we were surprised to find upon arrival that the rooms (with the exception of a few suites) do not have windows! Luckily we were upgraded to a very nice room because of a mistake made by Expedia, but the windows in our room were covered with a film. The building feels a bit like a former military site for high ranking officials. "
maidens hotel ,"Peace and Quiet...huge room The most peaceful hotel I stayed in during my tour in India. Carpeted hallways and thick stone walls keep all the noise out. Our room was huge. Almost too big! Staff was very helpful. They helped us make phone calls and arranged to ship us a sweater we left in our room. The restaurant is delicious. We ordered a la carte, which was a bargain and delicious food. Breakfast is good, but special orders take a long time. "
maidens hotel ,"Great Choice in Old Delhi Highly recommended, gracious accommodation and super service. Great value compared to The Imperial or The Taj. Super rooms, go for a premier room, worth the extra.Well located for the attractions of the Old City, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, etc. Not so good for nightlife or restaurants, but Delhi sprawls and nowhere is good for everything. "
maidens hotel ,"Greatest hotel ever The Oberoi Maidens is a old colonial house, a heritage. It is situated near to the station an Old Delhi, but very calm. The service ist great, very friendly. For breakfast there is a big assortment of continental and indian foods. The restaurant has great indian food with very delicious sweets. Because I stayed here in winter time, I couldn't use the pool outside. But the rooms were heated well. They were very clean, noble in space with marble in the bathroom, which was as large as other whole rooms in a hotel. To stay in the Maidens Hotel is a little bit like a great Step back in the history with all security of today. "
maidens hotel ,"Beautiful Hotel I stayed here at the beginning and end of a 16 day tour and was impressed with this hotel. On the first occasion I was upgraded to a suite (room 402) which was consisted of an enormous sitting room and equally large bedroom and had a truly luxurious ultra modern bathroom with marble walls and venetian style mirrors. The shower was enclosed in a glass wetroom. Even the loo was in its own glass cubicle. Everything was spotless. I ate with our tour group in the restaurant and the food was very good and service outstanding. It is part of the Oberoi group, so it lived up to expectations. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants modern accommodation in a colonial building. "
maidens hotel ,"Good City Choice We have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel as part of our holiday in India. The hotel is situated in Old Delhi about a 10 minute taxi ride from the Red Fort. A hotel in the old city is further from the airport than any located in the new part of Delhi. We arrived at the hotel at 4am in the morning. I may have selected a hotel in the new city to avoid the extra 30 minutes or so drive from the airport.The hotel is in a very quiet location and very clean, which were important considerations for us. Our double room had been refurbished to a high standard and was very spacious. This included a good sized, new bathroom which is not always provided in these hotels.The room had tea making facilities. As we had an early start we ate at the hotel restaurant. The service was excellent and the food reasonably priced. However the menu was limited and or average standard. "
maidens hotel ,"Nice but quirky Older, typically British-style property. As noted by others, no exterior windows, but this didn't bother us. If you're used to the 4 Seasons, then this not for you. If you like older hotels with different types of rooms, and willing to put up with poor a/c and noisy wedding party (on weekends only) then try it. You might like it - we did.If you don't like the first room assigned go look at others. You eventually (with persistence) will find an acceptable one.Buffet breakfast above average. "
maidens hotel ,Lovely hotel but very expensive restaurant Our first stop on our first holiday to India. Had a lovely room but all the windows of all the rooms seem to look out onto the coridoor which makes them rather dark.Didn't really have much time to explore as our two days were taken up with guided tours but the swimming pool looked very nice!The drinks and the restaurant food were double the price we paid at other 5 star hotels in India so suggest you get a taxi to dine out. Chor Bazaar in New Delhi is excellent and great fun! 
maidens hotel ,We expected something better This hotel was a disappointment as the rooms were very dated. We had a TV in an old cabinet from the 70's. The room was large to the point of being too large for the amount of furniture in it. There was a room for our suitcases with metal cabinets like we had in high school. The bathroom was nice. We had a room with a window to the hallway. The restaurant was very expensive. Breakfast was pretty good. There was nothing near the hotel in walking distance so we took a tuk tuk. The outside and hotel lobby were nicer than the rest of the hotel. I would probably look for a different hotel if I was coming back to Delhi. We asked to break some money and the hotel could not change a 500 rupee for smaller money. 
maidens hotel ,"Slightly disappointed I stayed at the Maidens in Old Delhi at the start of an escorted tour of Northern India. Having read the guide books and reviews, I was keenly looking forward to this particular hotel.I must say that the hotel did not come up to expectations. Although the hotel is clean enough, the plumbing is quite out of date and is in need of renovations. Many of the rooms are small and have no windows. The Garden Terrace restaurant offered poor food and breakfast in the same restaurant was not up to Indian standards.The reception staff I found off-hand and unhelpful. I appreciate that there is an atmosphere at the hotel that puts it above the 'cold' comforts of the international chain hotels, but I had hoped for a better experience. "
maidens hotel ,"Absolutely fine - but lacking soul We stayed here for the last two nights of a two week holiday in India - and maybe that was the problem. We'd stayed in such amazing hotels, full of colour and life along the way, that the Maidens seemed a little characterless. It's a lovely looking building , and the suite we had was, large, well equipped and comfortable - though it had no outside windows which made it feel a bit oppressive - and it lacked any homely touches or decoration. And we never did master the air conditioning so were a bit chilly at night! We ate in the restaurant both nights as there didn't seem to be a handy alternative. Again the food was OK , the service pleasant if slightly chaotic - but we had much better elsewhere. Breakfast was fine - though again a bit chaotic with lots of toast burning going on! The pool and pool area were pleasant and peacefulSo absolutely fine as a first or last night hotel. If you're staying longer in Delhi you may want somewhere with a bit more soul. "
maidens hotel ,Not impressed This was an extremely disappointing end to our holiday in India. Whilst this looks like an impressive hotel from the outside we were very unhappy with our room. Anyone staying here should note that their so called 'superior rooms' on the first floor are all internal (we were in room 207) with a frosted glass window into the corridor that lets in very little light. This may not bother some people but I found it extremely claustrophobic. The room was also badly in need of a coat of paint and the bathroom was a litle dingy. I think what really made me angry however was the disinterested and apathetic response from staff at the front desk. They were less than helpful when asked to do anything and when we enquired about changing the room we were told that &quot;most of our rooms have no windows&quot;. That was that. I would have expected a higher level of customer service from a hotel in the Oberoi group and to have at least been offered an upgrade which we would have considered. The breakfast buffet was very poor compared to previous hotels we stayed in and the hotel itself was located far away from the centre of the city/shops etc. 
maidens hotel ,"An oasis in Delhi The pool area is lovely &amp; relaxing with friendly staff. Could be doing with controls for air conditioning in bedrooms as we were cold at night in them. Found the food expensive -e.g..575 r. for a room service toastie ^ for my son &amp; dinners were more expensive than everywhere else we went.As this was our first stop in India, we felt we'd no choice because no alternative within walking distance locally.There were no real windows in the bedrooms as just frosty overlooking the corridor.On the whole, the pool &amp; little cafe area made this a good place to stay for 3 nights whilst travelling around Delhi area &amp; we wished we were back there when we ended up in the City Park Hotel later in the tour. "
maidens hotel ,"superb location This hotel is in a great location. It is minutes from the fantastic Delhi Metro station Civil Lines. It's SO easy to ride the metro a couple of stops to the central areas of Delhi.The rooms are large, quiet, comfortable and good value for money. The pool is a decent size and the garden a nice place to retreat to for a cool off.Staff are extremely helpful should you need any advice or help. I would definately stay here on my next trip to Delhi.I particularly liked the fact that my room had a seperate seating area that I could retreat to after putting my 4 year old to bed. "
maidens hotel ,"fantastic We stayed at this lovely place three separate times in the month of December 2007. Staff was fabulous ... especially front desk and breakfast waiters. We stayed in three separate rooms, and highly recommend an upgrade to the newly renovated 4th floor executive suites.Travel in India can be tiring, and having a wonderful place like Maidens Hotel to relax in made our stay in India FABULOUS. "
maidens hotel ,great hotel Spent 2 nights at this lovely hotel. Everything about our stay was enjoyable. Food at breakfast and dinner was excellent. Nice big rooms although a little faded. Great pool area. Service throughout the hotel was first class. They are great people. 
maidens hotel ,"Historic Charm I found the Maidens to be a great hotel. If you are visiting Delhi as a tourist, this is the place for you. It is full of colonial charm, great service, and has beautiful grounds and landscaping complete with roaming peacocks. The room was very large with traditional décor. The breakfast was good. Architecturally the building is a delight. It lacks some of the modern elements you would find in a business hotel- it is a historic building with some creaks and old fashioned elements, but that is what I found best about it. It is a relaxing oasis that connects with India’s history and is also near the Red Fort and other attractions. On the same trip I stayed one night at one of the modern business hotels downtown where I paid more and wished I was back at the Maidens. "
maidens hotel ,"Disappointed with the room We arrived at 04:00 hrs at the Maiden Hotel, it looked very impressive. Very clean and grand considering what lay in the streets outside. We were given a room on the ground floor which was huge, albeit a little on the sparce side. The bed was a king size but the matress was as hard as nails. We had a seperate dressing room area and a large bathroom. On the whole it was clean but it could have done with a lick of paint. I didn't like the fact that there were no windows, only two frosted ones that if opened would look out into the corridor.On the whole I was relatively pleased with the room until I saw my dads room. It was beautiful. He had a marble shower with gleaming gold taps, fluffly towels and dressing gowns. The bed was like it was fit for a princess. As we were on a VJV tour and had all paid the same money I was a little put out about this. I got my husband to ask why we had a basic room and he didn't. We were told that he had had an upgrade!! I accepted that and tried not to moan anymore. Breakfast was a real treat. Boiled eggs were made to order and the spread of fresh fruit was mouth watering. The breakfast room over looked lovely green well kept gardens. The staff were a little on the aloof side, but very attentive.The evening meal was a buffet, the food was hot and plentiful.The surrounding gardens were well kept with an ambundance of flowers. The swimming area was secluded but the water covered with dead flies!!!On the whole a good hotel, if you pay the price for an upmarket room to complete the experience. "
maidens hotel ,"Two nights at The Maidens I spent two nights at The Maidens, upon arrival in Delhi. Nearly everything I'd previously read about the property, turned out to be my experience exactly. The frosted window facing the courtyard/walkway gave one the feeling of an inside stateroom, on a cruise ship. Some what confining. The room &amp; bthroom were both large. There was a terry cloth covered step you had to use to enter the tub/shower because of it's height, plus the &quot;rising&quot; shower curtain when one turned on the shower, was some what of an inconvenience. Beautiful bathroom, but everything ended up WET because the shower curtain floated. The lack of individual temperature control for the air was not good. The electrical power fluctuated and went off several times, during our visit, leaving one in the dark. Overall, the property, grounds, etc. are well maintained, be it somewhat antiquated. Breakfast (furnished) was merely breakfast, nothing to write home about. Would I return, yes. Location not ideal, but the hotel was very nice. "
maidens hotel ,"Good hotel but rooms could do with a little renovation My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights at the start of our holiday. The public areas of the hotel are well maintained and have a colonial feel to them. The food was good and the staff friendly and courteous. Our room was large with a separate area for storing cloths and where the mini bar was located. I would say that it could have done with a little work as the decor did seem a little tired. Our room also had no window, but I don't know if this is true of all the rooms at the hotel. We had a wander outside, but there is very little within walking distance in the way of bars and restaurants, so we ate exclusively at the hotel. Prices, as you would expect, were expensive compared to eating out in Delhi, but still cheaper than you would expect to pay in England. The Red Fort is close by. Over all, I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. "
maidens hotel ,Lovely old hotel with character and colonial feel Lovely old hotel with character and colonial feel in old section of Delhi. Large rooms. I ordered from the menu in both restaurants and found the food to be excellent. 
maidens hotel ,"Pleasant Hotel The Maidens Hotel is a very pleasant colonial style hotel in Delhi. As other reviews have said, there is not much within walking distance but in a city as massive as Delhi it’s impossible to be central to everything. The location is fine and everything you could possibly want to see is a relatively short taxi ride away. The hotel rooms are huge. They are well kept and well cleaned. Nothing too fancy but certainly above standard for India. There were no real windows in our hotel room but we never felt as if we were boxed in. The frosted windows to the hallway serve their purpose and there is plenty natural lighting and windows throughout the hotel. We found the food in the hotel to be rather pricey but of above average quality. The hotel bar is small but a very nice place to relax and have a cold Kingfisher after a long day of sightseeing in the hectic city of Delhi (talk to the bartender “Richard”, he’s a fun guy). The morning breakfast was great. They have a nice mix of traditional English breakfasts and Indian cuisine plus endless cups of nice strong coffee. They also serve some great fresh squeezed watermelon juice.From what I gathered, the entire hotel was filled with older (senior) British tourists. There was nothing wrong with this but you may feel more like you’re in England than India at some points while at this hotel. That said, there were a number of Indian functions taking place while we were there (weddings. parties, dinners, etc.) so it must be well liked by the upper class locals.The hotel staff (more so the front desk) is a bit inept. They just seemed to be missing a beat but I’ve never been one to get overly agitated with hotel staffs. Be assertive when you need to and they will accommodate your requests. Just a heads up, they will have no recommendations for eating outside the hotel. Definitely make it a point to research some restaurants if you plan on eating out. Moti Mahal was a very good restaurant. Don’t let the surroundings scare you away. Overall it’s a pleasant place. Don’t let negative reviews make you think this place is cockroach pit. The hotel is clean, the food is good and the staff is average. "
maidens hotel ,Old fashioned India The Maidens is a lovely old-fashioned hotel. The rooms are large and very clean. The breakfast that came along with the room was ample although not terribly exciting. The hotel staff was very helpful and the backyard of the hotel often has a wedding going on which is quite fun to watch. You cannot walk anywhere from the hotel but taxis are easy to get and there is a subway stop somewhere not too faw away. 
maidens hotel ,"Colonial Charm A colonial hotel, a little frayed at the edges, near old Delhi. Huge rooms (without a view, but light enough) and even more huge dressing area and bathroom. Needed a lick of paint, but for character, service and charm, was absolutely fine. "
maidens hotel ,"Tired Dirty and overrated Arrived late at night from UK - long transfer across Delhi to get to the hotel. The public areas are ok - but the rooms are very poor - no air conditioning - just a vent in the top of the ceiling. Our room smelt of damp and had cockroaches! Not a great welcome to India! Also most of the standard rooms have no windows - just a frosted window to the hallway.We then had a series of hotel staff knocking at the door at 1am trying to show us round the room etc all wanting a tip! It is really annoying when all you want to do is shower, unpack and go to bed.The breakfast room and food offering were below average and the staff were barely interested in helping.We were really disappointed as we expected a smart colonial style hotel that would be clean and friendly. We were only in Delhi for 2 nights and out sightseeing during the days but dreaded returning to the hotel.This really is nothing like the rest of the Oberoi hotels which are all amazing! "
maidens hotel ,"Luxurious but flawed There's a lot to like about this hotel. We stayed in one of the suites (no smaller rooms were available), which was simply and attractively furnished and very spacious. There was a little noise from the road, but this is inevitable in Delhi. The disappointments came with other features. Breakfast was notably poor - not enough seats in the small breakfast room, and the worst choice of food we had anywhere in India. The bar was also disappointing.We visited some friends at the Imperial which seemed like a very impressive hotel all round, and I think we would stay there next time. "
maidens hotel ,Great last night in India We booked this hotel through a travel agent after selecting from the trip-advisor web page. The hotel made a nice change from the multi-storey variety and has the real feel of what an Indian hotel should be. The room was spacious and comfortable and the staff at the front desk really helpful.The restaurant/coffee bar was no great shakes but adequate and there was a lovely swimming pool in the gardens.As we had an early flight a superb continental breakfast was served in our room at 5am!! Highly recommended. 
maidens hotel ,Comfortable and Spacious This was a lovely end to our stay in India. The hotel provided an excellent breakfast and had clean spacious rooms. The room was clean and had very comfortable beds. The hotel staff were very friendly and happy to engage in conversation. 
maidens hotel ,"Not bad for the price in Delhi I had to go to Delhi for a few days for a trade fair and chose the Maidens hotel as it seemed to be a decent 3-4 star hotel from whatever info I could find on the web. New Delhi hotels can be a pit pricey, and I had managed to get a good package deal here. The hotel upgraded me to a suite room for 1000 Rs. extra. While the suite was huge the furnishing was just about decent, nothing fancy. There was only one tv in the living room and you cant watch TV lying in bed. Also the windows of the rooms had frosted glass and hence it makes you feel more lonely esp. if you are travelling alone. Staff was friendly and cooperative. The hotels location is not great, but they arrnange for taxis instantly at the hotel. Food is also good, though theres not much too choose from at breakfast "
maidens hotel ,"so and so the hotel is charming, but not so much.rooms are large and comfortable,BUT: if breakfast is not included, they charge for it too much money.the location is not so good,because it is in old dehli,too dirty and noisy. "
maidens hotel ,"A very Colonial Hotel This was our first stop in India, arriving at Delhi airport late at night, the journey across Delhi was an experience to behold in itself, it took about an hour but at least our driver knew where he was going. The hotel was clean and comfortable, plenty of hot water, the room was large although a bit dark. The air conditioning worked well if a bit noisy, the windows didn't open which was a bit of a nuisance but I don't think we would have had much of a view anyway. The food was good, the staff helpful especially in the restaurant when choosing Indian dishes. All our trips and cars had been pre booked so we didn't have any problems in that area. The hotel was efficient at changing our travellers cheques. The hotel is a bit out of the way, the street outside is very busy but the people are friendly. Delhi is a sight to behold in its self, but so worth a visit. We didn't see any monkeys in the area. "
maidens hotel ,"OK but not much more Spent 2 nights here.The room was large and the beds comfortable, but the style was dated 70's and didn't match the elegant exterior of the building. We never had any problems with hot water, and enjoyed the breakfast , and the evening buffet meal. The pool is a good size and deep too. The hotel is out of the way though, being neither in New Delhi or the old city. That means a tiring and hectic taxi ride to get anywhere. As a tourist this was a pain- if we return to Delhi I think I would choose a more conveniently situated hotel "
maidens hotel ,"Not satisfying We stayed here for tree nights in December 2005 and were very disappointed as well. While the reception area doesn't look bad, the rooms are very old-fashioned, dark and do not seem to be very clean. Also we had a problem with the cold, and all we got was this small heater as well...Staff was very very slow, especially the concierge at the front desk. Everytime we asked for something, it took them hours, even if it was somethin very small...The location of the Maidens Hotel isn't a pro either-the biggest problem is, that barely no Taxidriver knows the place and they always mixed it up with the Oberoi-Hotel, After having had dinner at The Park we really regretted that we didn't stayed there-but next time.... "
maidens hotel ,"Colonial Charm The Maidens Hotel was the first and the best hotel (of four) that my wife and I stayed at in India on honeymoon. Out of the city centre, it suited us perfectly as it proved a wonderfully peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of Delhi at large.The staff were both helpful and professional and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them. The food was equally fantastic and provided a introduction into the subtlety of Indian cooking (in hindsight, I only wish that I had been braver to eat more of the meat dishes).As for the rooms, they were luxurious and spacious. I say rooms as we were lucky enough to get upgraded to make way for an Indian wedding party - itself a spectacle to behold.An amazing experience. "
maidens hotel ,"Average overpriced and far away This is an average hotel. I was charged $150 for a room, but was told by the hotel clerk that the room goes for $180. I felt sorry for myself that I paid $150 and sorrier for the fools who pay $180. If you are going to choose a hotel in this price range and this far away from the center of things, you are better off choosing a room at the Intercontinental at Nehru Place or The Grand New Dehli - two great hotels. The rooms and hallways at the Maidens are shabby, and restaurants/services are limited. My flight out of India was delayed for several days, so I stayed at several hotels. Maidens ranks as the most expensive and one of my least favorite. "
maidens hotel ,"A beautiful escape from the chaos! The Maidens is a bit isolated, which can be an advantage if you're tired of the constant sensory overload of the city. I spent the last 2 nights of a 30 day stay in India here, and it was a delightful way to end my trip. The staff are professional, the hotel is very well maintained, the rooms are enormous and very cool (almost cold at night). The grounds are lovely, including a large pool and outdoor cafe.When I wanted to go anywhere, taxis were waiting onsite. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit. "
maidens hotel ,Atmospheric Hotel We arrived late at the Oberoi Maidens and were upgraded to a suite (we'd booked a standard room) The staff were extremely helpful and we particularly enjoyed the ambience of the hotel - it is a real throwback to the days of the Raj and the dining room is hung with fascinating photographs. Historical interest - Lutyens stayed here when New Delhi was being built - and it was a favourite dining place for the British during colonial days. Food and service were good and the grounds are pretty with an attractive swimming pool.We also stayed at the Park in New Delhi (excellent) but the Maidens has a very individual character. The surroundings are not particularly attractive but this is Old Delhi and don't you want to see the 'real'India?

marina hotel new delhi ,"Scandalous! Scandalous! We were told this hotel had 4 stars it´s not even worth 1. Unclean, soiled, worn down and we saw cockroaches in the diningroom. Terrible stay, nothing in the hotell fit the descriptrion we got beforehand. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Disgusting Never ever is the word.Do not stay here, it is disgusting, from the dilapitated outside to the towels with holes as big as your two fists. Everything about this hotel is terrible. I don't know where to begin. The only thing I can say is that this made me feel as if I am in a dingy hotel in New York City in the 70s and lots of hookers have slept on the bed that I slept on that night only I am India. I wore a long tank top, a hoodie (that I stretched out so my face don't have to touch anything), sweats and socks.Musty room, stained bedrest, food dried on the wall, broken tiles in the bathroom, non-draining shower and the plastic in the bathroom is yellow. And no, I did not dare try the food. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Horrible Horrible and Horrible I am extremely disgusted with this place. Worst place I have ever stayed. The hotel is 4-star rated but frankly, I have stayed in places better than this which are not star-rated. Rooms are damp, smelly, rotting, cracks on walls. Toilets are disgusting. Absolutely horrible place to stay. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Not THAT bad! I do agree with other reviewers that this hotel has seen better days and the claims of being 4* are pushing it a bit, but I didn't think it was that bad. My room was clean and tidy, and the location is really central - easy for exploring and handy for the metro stations. The breakfast was ok, and they have a 24 hour cafe on the premises, handy for getting bottles of water whatever time you get in! On reflection, whilst I certainly wasn't knocked out by the experience, it was a perfectly good place to stay for a couple of nights in Delhi. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Bad end to great India trip We paid S$200 (about US$130) to the travel agency to arrange for this additional 1-day stay in Delhi, thinking it would be a good end to a great trip traversing Kashmir, Ladakh, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, having been assured it is one of the better hotels. To our dismay, the hotel looked dilapidated from the outside when we arrived (see photo), though it was in the heart of Connaught Place - the shopping area in New Delhi. There were only 2 levels (with the ground level consisting of only the bell-reception area and lift). A small hotel, it was dirty and the bell-boy was a middle-aged grouchy man who dragged our luggage and did not bother to talk at all. The reception personnel was, however, polite and helpful. Our room (standard) floor was small, dirty / sandy and un-carpeted, and there were cigrette butts in the bathroom floor. The room is on the same level as a walkway (which our window opens to) used by the staff of the hotel. This made it neccessary for us to keep the curtains closed, which the poor lighting in the room made it look dinghy. Our breakfast was reasonably ok, consisting of Indian and Continental fare. The dining area was, however, a made-shift one in the conference hall, and it was not very clean. Besides the reception staff, the only other saving grace is the location - right smack in the heart of Connaught Place. If you wish to avoid travelling much and yet get some shopping and meals done, I guess it is not a bad place, though you would have to put up with the other bad points about the hotel. Definitely not worth the money paid, and not 4-star as claimed (maybe only 2-star). (Am not sure, however, if there is really a vast difference in standards and expectations between the Indians (the recommenders) and foreigners (the reviewers), which led to this and many other bad reviews, when the hotel is claimed to be a government-sanctioned 4-star one. Guess one needs to either pay more for good hotels in Delhi, or reduce the expectation.) "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Very delapidated looking hotel The only good thing about this hotel was the staff who were very helpful and considerate. The room was below average (even for India), the food average and the food service poor. I would never stay in this hotel again "
marina hotel new delhi ,Should not call itself a Hotel. Absolutely terrible. This hotel was booked thru a travel agent in Delhi. I love to travel and never used a tour agent before and thought I would give it a try. (She told me it was a 4-5 star hotel.) Big mistake. WIll never use a tour agent again. Room was damp and musky. Tthe AC didn't work properly and was noisy. The fan that was in the room was dusty and broken. The bedsheets looked liked the should have been discarded 20 years ago. Felt like bugs were in the bed with me sleeping. The toilet was disgusting. The service was terrible. The bellman who carried my bags griped about my tip. Lucky it was for only one night. When the hotel is charging 5000 Rupees ($100 US) then it should meet western standards or at least be clean. I stayed at hostels that charged a fraction but a million times cleaner and friendlier. Didnot want to waste my digital camera taking photos of this dump. 
marina hotel new delhi ,"A liitle bit noisy old utility Before travelling to New Delhi, I looked at reviews about this hotel at TripAdvisor, and it was very helpful.At check-in, I requested a quiet room not facing streets to avoid noisy traffic and in the middle of corridor.I could avoid traffice noise but I was in bad luck and awaken by the loud noise of some barking dogs at night for an hour. Also, I could hear loud sound of foot steps when people walked in the corridor at night. There was no carpet in the hallway.Fundamently the hotel was designed without sound-proof windows.Hot water pressure of shower facility at bathroom was so weak that I could barely take warm shower.The floor of room was not cleaned every day, but it was cleaned when I requested.The line Internet was not installed, the hotel provides wireless Internet, but the signal was so weak that I could not use the Internet.With regrad to other things that were rased by reviewers at TripAdvisor, it was improved.Bed linen was clean, TV was good with many channels, and breakfast food was good. New carpet was put in breakfast restaurant. There were no bugs in room or restaurant.The hotel staff said that they are renovating it, but I do not know how soon it will be. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"NOT WORTH ONE STAR recomended by india tourist office where we paid our fee for deluxe hotel room, we were shown to our room, which turned out to be a standard room with view overlooking back alley behind hotel the bedcover was filthy and in a disgusting condition and the room smelt of urine. upon ordering a cuppa from room service it arrived and was served in cracked cups at night the corridor sounded like piccadilly circus and woken several times by the noise the buffet breakfast was cold and inedible and on the last morning both eggs on my plate rotten staff although efficient and friendly were always pestering for tips. my personal advice steer clear its yeuk!!!!!!!!!!!! "
marina hotel new delhi ,"An absolute dump This hotel is an absolute dump and should be pulled down. We were booked to stay 3 nights at the Marina but only stayed 1 night. The hotel had supposedly been renovated - it certainly had not started when we were there in October 2006. The toilet leaked, the shower leaked, everything was filthy dirty.It may be acceptable if you paid $40AUD and rated as a 2 star hotel but to pay $170AUD and be rated 4 star is daylight robbery.We experienced 5 rooms before being upgraded to the suite - each was as bad as the other, including the suite.Don't waste your money. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Nice warm hotel in the heart of Delhi Booked a room at the Marina by contacting them directly. Reservations were easy enough and available at short notice, with a 25% discount on the list price. The best part about this hotel is the location and price. Rooms are clean and open on to a balcony. Plus the hotel has a nice warm feel to it!! "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Worse than any hotel I've ever stayed in I traveled as a single parent of a teenager to India as part of a last-minute package tour during the peak tourist season (Christmas break). Hotel Marina was where we spent our first two and last day before leaving India. It was the only hotel available when the tour agency made arrangements for Delhi, and cost more than $200/night, so I assumed it was a decent place.We landed, exhausted of course, in Delhi and were met by our travel agency and transferred to the Hotel Marina. I had expected India to be dirtier than we are used to, but nothing prepared me for the Hotel Marina.The desk staff completely ignored me for more than 3 minutes as I stood there in front of two chatting men at 5am. When a gentleman approached the desk to check out, the desk staff was immediately helpful and solicitous. So I will rate the friendliness of the reception staff as &quot;Okay, but some problems&quot; based on its effort, but inability to deal with a single woman.We were given 144, which was at the absolute end of a labyrinth of corridors and overlooking the busy Connought Circle (which is a cacophony of horns even at the wee hours). I have found cleaner restrooms on the motorway. The shower did not have a shower curtain, and was a spigot over a drain in the bathroom floor. There was no cold water. There was standing water in the corner by the toilet, which was humorously banded with a paper &quot;Disinfected for your Use.&quot; There was no top on the toilet tank, and we had to reach in and pull the ball up to flush. There was mold on some of the walls, and it was black and thick on the tiles of the shower area. The TV did not work, half of the various lamps/light bulbs in the room were burnt out, and the room smelled so strongly of mold that our noses started to stop up within an hour. The noise from the street was so strong, it was as if we were outside with the thronging masses.We asked to change rooms.In the new room (see pictures), at least we had a tub with shower curtain, but it was a very small step up. There was still mold everywhere, and the room hadn't been swept in a long time. The dust bunnies were huge and really disgusting, and rolled back and forth around the floor like tumbleweeds while the oscillating fan was on.At breakfast, we realized how clean our rooms actually were. The floor was carpeted, but it is hard to tell what the color was - it was the color of a million stains and pieces of lint and crumbs. I truly believe that the carpet had not been vacuumed (let alone cleaned) for years. We left our things at one of the three non-smoking tables and approached the buffet. A waiter lifted a tray with watermelon juice to us, and a large cockroach ran up one of the glasses and started scurrying across the top. I turned him down quickly and he simply brushed the bug onto the floor and it scurried away. At the buffet, I turned to my son and told him not to eat anything that wasn't cooked and that didn't have a high flame under the chafing dish to ensure that it was being kept very hot. He reached for a bun, and another cockroach emerged, crawling over the same bun that he wanted. I motioned to the waiter and pointed out the new offending bug, and it was (again) brushed off the table and onto the dark floor where it disappeared in the mottled mess.Sickened, I grabbed my kid and we left. We found a McDonalds across the street and down one block.That evening, while I was brushing my teeth (with bottled water) in the hotel room, my son screamed. I came out to find him on the bed pointing at the largest palmetto bug (a large winged cockroach) I had ever seen crawling across the floor towards his bed. I grabbed an ashtray and trapped it, and slid it across the floor and out over the threshold for someone else to deal with.The room was stuffy and smelly, so I decided to open the window. At once, I realized that the price of a private room was a room overlooking the alley/trash cans. I quickly shut the window again. The room across from ours and the room next to ours had some sort of group of male merchants (clothes hanging on racks), and lots of men sitting on chairs chatting with cups of tea could be seen through the open doors any time we walked by. At 1AM, however, the noise of their boisterous conversation was driving us crazy. The halls are not carpeted, and act as echo chambers for any movement, and their conversation wasn't quiet. I knocked on one of the doorjambs and asked if they would please close their doors. One merely waived his hand dismissively saying, &quot;Sorry sorry.&quot; and I went back to my room. At 2AM, when the noise continued, I called reception and asked for help. After hearing him come to their room and converse for a moment, he left. The men then came to my room, pounding on the door and screaming, &quot;Crazy madam!&quot; They returned every half hour or so to remind me that I was crazy.I was unbelievably relieved to leave the hotel the next morning. It was a very unpleasant experience, and as one traveler said, it was a very disappointing introduction to India. We were only there for a few hours on our departure, and after personally calling around trying to find a hotel with rooms, I gave up and convinced my son that it wouldn't be so bad, and promising him that we'd eat at McDonald's.Stay away from this horrible place!!! PLEASE!! "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Not the best introduction to India Stayed at the start and end of an Explore holiday in India.Positives: helpful staff, bar drinks and food okNegatives: room smelt musty, damp patches on wall, bathroom v poor: dimly lit, ancient cracked tiling and fittings, only hot water, dodgy looking electrics (but all working in our room at least).Not recommended as an intoduction to India "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Not what it says on the tin Stayed here twice with some 18 other group members as part of an Explore holiday. The hotel has little resemblance to the way it describes itself on its website. It is located on a main road and hence the nearby traffic is very noisy (even for Delhi). Some rooms are very poorly maintained and dirty, others are adequate (but no more). Hot water and air conditioning are erratic. Breakfast is poor, meals ordered off the menu are average or poor depending on your choice. The bar is good (the beer is cold) and the hotel staff try to be helpful. Money changing at the hotel is erratic so best to change at the airport.Although I did not find it as bad as many of the reviews, given a choice, I would seek to pay more for a better quality hotel. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"utterly dreadful marina hotel. This was an appalling hotel. It was a totally filth-ridden tourist rip-off foul heap of a decrepit overpriced grimy monstrosity. Our rooms (212 and 216) were filthy and the toilet leaked. We all got nasty food poisoning from the vile unhygienic excues which passed for a kitchen. The telephone bill was criminal extortion - the equivalent of 40 UK pounds for a 10 minute call to Britain. This was robbery. We knew this and were were told so by the tourist office on Janpath, members of staff at the university, and the British High Commission. Do not go to this hotel it is dreadful. You will be ill, and all your money taken from you, and you will end up feeling depressed, low, and that you have just been in a terrible place and that you want to go home. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Probably the worst Despite the promising address of Connaught Circus, when the taxi pulled up on the pavement outside this dirty, dingy address, we knew we were in trouble. As one of the other reviews had advised us, we asked for a room away from the traffic noise, but to no avail. Our room was very poor, but the worst point of this hotel was its rstaurant where one was forced to have breakfast. What a dirty dingy hole!My advice is to pay a bit extra, and get a decent hotel. This one is rubbish, and its web-site ought to be repeorted as being downright misleading "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Could do better I recently stayed at the Marina Hotel on two seperate nights as part of a package tour in India. Both rooms I stayed in weren't without their flaws. The bathroom, while being made of marble, was in need of a clean. There was alot of mould in the shower recess and the shower nozzle sprayed in all directions. The towels were old and worn out. The sheets were torn and stained. I opted to sleep in my sleeping bag liner instead. The hotel lobby was definetely in a better condition than the rooms. The staff were friendly and porters delivered and collected our bags quickly. Try to request a room not facing the street as these are considerably quieter than street front rooms, where traffic can be heard around the clock. "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Acceptable but bring your linen The hotel was an acceptable option because it is extremely hard to find anything worthwile in Delhi in the mid-range section. We paid around 70 USD per night. Marina is rated four stars but it is on a one star (maybe 2 stars) level in Europe. Hotel is in a shabby state and the lobby looks better than the rooms. The first night we were there the room was very noisy because of the refrigerator which was making a terrible sound. When we turned it off, the water was leaking to we had to suffer. Next morning they put us up in a different room and this was OK. Linen did not look too clean so we put up our own. Bathroom is mouldy and the shower is not working right. Breakfast buffet was substandard (Indian food, toast, some fruit). Staff is OK. Do not take the rooms on the second floor at the end of the corridor (for example room 245 and similar). These rooms have not been used for a long time and have a funny smell. (These are facing the terrace). "
marina hotel new delhi ,"Stay away from this hotel If we had not arrived at midnight, we would have walked out right away. The building and the rooms are run down, services are unfriendly, our rooms are dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the phones could not call out. Could not sleep well at all after 7 hour flight and we are so bothered that we are leaving first thing in the morning. "
marina hotel new delhi ,pessimo pessimo 
marina hotel new delhi ,Marina hotel accettabile 
megha palace ,Delhi Looks like an apartment converted to a Hotel.Interiors are decent and well maintained.But no good support from reception regarding travel or tourism.Food provided is not good enough and not on time. Probably getting from some other source.No other activity in the hotel when you come out of the room. Overall a congested feeling. 
megha palace ,"Good service The hotel is ok, clean and have good service. The staff was very helpful, and everytime we had questions they helped us imediatly. We booked a 4 days trip with them and thaught it was very good. We had our own guide and driver that we were very satisfied with. We could enjoy our vaccation and see the real India in a way that we could not do by ourselves. "
megha palace ,"Warning:-The SUCKS I had booked a super deluxe room with the hotel for one night, since i had to board a train back home from my honeymoon trip.I reached the hotel at night around 23.00 and was led up to my room. The room had a torn bedsheet which I told them to change, upon removing the bedsheet we saw a gapping hole in the mattress cover too.The replacement bedsheet had oil stains on it and looked pretty old from the blue stains.The bathroom had two torn towels, in fact it seemed they had been used for more than they should have, since they were nearly thread bare.The refrigerator was kept in a wooden closet and at one corner you could see a large damp patch due to improper drainage of defrost water.The AC had a front panel that was stuck on with CelloTape.The room was too small to be comfortable and felt suffocating,even for normal rooms charges, i would have not booked it, had i known about it, leave alone &quot;Superior Deluxe Room&quot;.The elevators moved with a jerk as if it was to giveaway any moment now.We were dog tired from our trip and since it was for a night, we had to put up with the hotel.I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody since they are cheating people by giving fancy names to rooms which by any standards are inhospitable.A huge THUMBS DOWN for this hotel. "
megha palace ,"Disgusted! - in league with one of the commision scammers After we hopped into a taxi at the airport (pre-paid no less) who conveniently couldn't speak English when we gave our hotel address, we were whisked off to a so called tourism office who then showed us Megha Palace.The sad and dreary reception is manned by a surly, sour and rude man who was reticent to provide us with fast or friendly service. After he huffed through the sign-in process we were shown the stuffy rooms. We were shown our room by a sleazy character who would not leave us in peace and confronted with filthy linen, grimy and paint peeling on the walls, exposed wires from light fittings, leaky plumbing, abused and dilapidated furniture. I didn't expect much in Delhi, but this was the pits for the US$35 night they were asking....I can unreservedly say it is way too much for what it is, and what it is, is extremely poor.When we tried to checkout the following morning the managers attitude had not changed. He in fact told us to sit while he quietly called the so-called &quot;tourist information man&quot;, or otherwise known as commison/scammer. who intercepted us. We were promptly whisked off again to try and make bookings for tours we did not want. Thanks Megha Palace!AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS! We have stayed in some low budget places, and this one is not value for money nor is it an ethical operation. "

megha palace ,"An unreliable unprofessional hotel My wife and I had reserved a two-night stay at the Megha Palace, including free airport pickup (which is offered if you stay two nights or longer). In our email we clearly specified the dates of our stay and the arrival date and time of our plane from Europe. The hotel confirmed our room and airport pickup bookings. But after going through the airport formalities and picking up our luggage (it was around 1:45 am), we found there was no one from the hotel to receive us. Lots of other hotels had drivers waiting for arriving passengers. You can imagine how bad we felt not seeing anyone holding a sign with our name. When I called the hotel up, they said they had no reservation for us for that night, but told us to take a pre-paid taxi to the hotel which they would reimburse. Naturally we assumed they had a room available. The taxi driver had a hard time finding the hotel - and we ended up having to call the hotel on our cell phone, which meant a long-distance call from Europe to India!! We gave the cell phone to the driver so he could get directions. When we got to the hotel at about 3 am, it turned out they had no room booked for us for that night and told us we needed to wait until 5 am when one of the rooms was supposed to be vacated. Why didn't they tell me this on the phone when I called from the airport?? We were very tired and sleepy and naturally wanted a room right away. So they booked us a room in another hotel in the area, but it wasn't that close - and we were told we had to vacate the room by 8 am!!! Having no choice, we proceeded to the hotel in the same taxi. After a sleepless few hours in the second hotel (accompanied by a few cockroaches and the constant noise of people talking, shouting and moving about), we went back to the Megha Palace (they sent a car for us). The second hotel had no rooms for the following night. The Megha Palace is adequate (though, like the other hotel, it was fairly noisy at night and there were some roaches in the room), and they did reimburse us for the taxi, BUT why did we have to go through all this??? We clearly specified the dates, and the hotel confirmed our room booking and the airport pickup. This is unacceptable. I was later told by an Indian relative that it is best to book by phone. I would recommend calling the hotel you've booked the day before to make sure they know you're coming. But...in Delhi please don't stay at the Megha Palace, Megha Sheraton or Madonna hotels (which belong to the Karmesh group)! "
megha palace ,"travelling alone in India I organised my travelling in India, 25 days, with the help of Megha Hotel since it provided appropriate room and service for the price, and returning time to time back from the trips, I had the feeling to return back home to the hotel. I got excellent help in organising my trips both by train, sleeping trainand by car and driver, with prebooked hotels of good quality in several villages. Special thanks for respecting by budget for the trip, I felt trust, I was safe, and picked up, and dropped at the railwaystations during the night as well. I had the pleasure to meet people from India, on business, and to speak to local people knowing well the traditions, and sights. in the hotels.Thanks for Mr.Pintou for the organisation, help, advice and care.

megha sheraton ,"basic budget hotel I booked at this hotel because they arranged what sounded like reliable taxi service. I came in late and left early. I could have made the taxi arrangements myself but was pleased to have someone else do it. Was also pleased that the arrangements were on time. I'm disappointed that budget hotels in Delhi are pretty highly priced compared to other places in the world and for the amenities they offer. This is a budget hotel. You'll get what you pay for (according to Delhi rates).Nevertheless, the hotel delivered what they said they would: taxi service (priced higher than if I would have arranged it myself but that's o.k.), wake up call, and agreed upon room price. That all goes a long way. "
megha sheraton ,"nice place to stay when coming to Delhi That was my first visit to Delhi.I arranged with Brother Naresh ( that s how we call each other now ! ) through Internet . Room nice , services nothing to complain about, very friendly staff, especially Mr Kashmeera , the Driver , and the night security . Friendly advices from the Boss who is around almost round the clock ! . The nearby snack , OMELETTE , is fantastic and nice staff very helpful.

"
megha sheraton ,"Meghagood When I first came into the hotel, I was bedazzled. It was more than I expected. It was nice, and why? First things first, the reception are energetic towards their customers and are ready to offer help. Second, the rooms are small but comfortable and the beds are enought o make you sleepy in the cold winter nights of Delhi. The owner of the hotel is a firendly man and he would arrange car services whenever tourists want a tour of the city. When it comes to Delhi, the owner of Megha Sheraton can give the guests valuable advice and has access to the latest information about Delhi and himself having connections and friendships with high-ranking people in India's capital.The only negative feeling I experienced is that the bellboys can hover around you for quite a long time and expecting guests to take their services for the sake of tips. But I guess this is common in India. Other than that, the boys can be helpful and ready to talk to you in case of service. Also, the television can have some antenna problems and hot water can be limited during the winter season but the television has great programmes and one can feel relaxed after a nice hot bath. Overall, this hotel is a great stay for those visiting Delhi with helpful hotel staff and a caring owner. This great place is ideal for backpackers, small families, couples and even business people. Besides, it is wlakign distance to some good local restaurants and sidewalk shops. "
megha sheraton ,Megha cool Hotel Megha Sheraton is a really nice place to stay for some days in Dehli. The rooms are clean and full equiped. The staff is friendly. The boss is a nice and friendly man who give good advices and organise really interesting tours with car and driver.

His response was prompt and we booked in for a period of two weeks, including our stay here and tours of Haridwar/Rishikesh and Agra/Jaipur/Pushkar. Mr Bhatia's professionalism, ambience, support and efficiency are most commendable. The hotel staff are also most friendly and efficient.

megha sheraton ,"Free Airport Transfers at the Megha Sheraton Megha Sheraton is a standard Indian business class hotel. The same company owns two other hotels in the area. I stayed for 4 days, which gave me free pick-up and drop at Delhi Airport. This bonus was the main reason for choosing the hotel for my first few nights in Delhi. The driver was waiting at the airport (very useful as many international flights arrive and leave late at night) so I could avoid the taxi touts. The hotel is well located, being within easy walking distance of the inexpensive and efficient Delhi Metro, though it wasn't well known by taxi drivers (get a hotel card). The affable manager will make tour arrangements for you in advance if you wish (I took a day trip to Agra, and a bus tour of Delhi). The free breakfast is offered at the Madonna Hotel just around the corner. The hotel isn't as well maintained as it should be, but I found in the next 6 weeks that that is a common problem with hotels in India. It was reasonably clean. I paid US$55 per night with breakfast and the free airport transfers. Contact from the website and e-mails are responded to promptly. "

megha sheraton ,"Sure To Return The hotel rate in India especially in Delhi is getting higher and higher due to an economic boom. However, this hotel (I stayed 3 nights at Hotel Megha Sheraton) offers much higher standard than the average hotel with such room rate could offer. Staff are very kind and hard working. The hotel arranged the efficient tour for me who stayed and visited many places for a short time. Especially for me who is looking for the best investment places in Delhi and suburban area like Gurgaon, Noida as well as Ghaziabad, I am very much thankful for hotel owner's advice and very reasonable cost to hire the car. The cost of hiring car with good drivers was much lower than all other hotel could provide. I could save my money quite a lot. I really thank for owner Mr. Naresh and I promise I return again with my son.NY and son "
megha sheraton ,"Serviceable They picked us up at the airport...the first big plus. Would not want to negotiate taxi at night to unusual location at Delhi airport.When I booked on the internet site, they said Mehga was full, so pushed us into the Madonna for the first night, which is more expensive. However, the rooms are identical. Then we switched back to Megha. It might have been a ploy to feel the Madonna. The rooms were pretty clean . The breakfast was pretty good. The location is great. In a pretty wealthy area, but it wont look like that if its your first stop in India. They arrange taxi. Also, its a short walk to the metro, which we found more fun as being on foot frees you from the tricky taxi drivers and allows you to see more of the street life. I would recommend doing the inner city sites by metro and foot. Its a very safe city once you realise that there are always a thousand eyes watching each other.The room was quite pricey for what you get (even by 2 star 1st world standards) and especially so compared to the rrest of india. But that is Delhi unfortunately. Would I go back? Probably, mainly b/c the rest of the stuff in the price range sounds terrible and b/c of the good location and b/c I felt safe. P.S. The rooms at Megha and Madonna are identical in quality...there is just a higher price at Madonna and a tacky but newer foyer. Also, I got bitten by bed bugs at the Madonna hotel the one night we stayed. "
megha sheraton ,"Budget traveller It was through my elder brother's recommendation that i considered Mega Hotels in Delhi. Being a budget traveller, i came to Mega Sheraton and to my amazement found it to be really really good. The rooms were clean, spaceous and averagely decorated. The hotel has got all the facilities -Cable TV, phone, tour packages, laundry &amp; room service etc. The staff are well mannered and informative. The Best aspect about the Mega Hotels as compared to any other hotels in Delhi is the entertaining, friendly , warm ,cooperative and helpful persona of Mr. Naresh Bhatia! Understanding my student budget restraints , he expertly come up with a complete 11 days detailed tour plan that made my very first travel experience of India to be thrilling and memorable! All in all for budget travellers - do not hesistate to stay at Mega Sheraton and for VIP's i recommend Mega Madonna!! "
megha sheraton ,"Fine enough for cheap Delhi hotel I have mixed feelings on this hotel... On the plus side - it was cheap, which is tougher and tougher to find in Delhi; they picked us up from the airport right on time, which can not be overvalued, especially early, early morning; they arranged a good sightseeing tour for us that was such a nice surprise; they had a TV; the manager was really friendly and personally helpful; it was reasonably clean.On the negative side, and most of these are to be expected at this price point... the bed was a rock (common in India); the street was loud (seems like all of Delhi is); the bathroom was dirty-ish (no where near western standards); the food was the worst we had in all of India, by far.That being said, I'd probably stay there again... for ~$60us, it probably can not be beat in delhi.

They did a nice job arrange for an airport pickup for my parents after their international flight, and were courteous and helpful throughout the stay.Karol Bagh was a little out of the way and hard to access by taxi in the middle of the day, which was a bit of a draw back, particularly when shlepping across traffic, after a rickshaw wallah just gave up trying to get us back there. "
megha sheraton ,"Depending on the price could be a good value Pluses: the hotel is clean, and the rooms have comfortable beds, tv, and some basic amenities. The location -- unknown to me from my previous visits to Delhi-- is actually pretty pleasant. It is a short cab ride to attractions, and the neighborhood has many shops and services that you can walk to while being (amazing!) pretty much free of touts and hawkers -- one of the most normal areas of Delhi I've stayed in.The staff was extremely helpful to me, and the breakfast was very nice. There were a few dubious things -- when I asked them for a cab to the airport, they offered me one for $12, but when I later booked one on my own for 400 rupees, they told me that they could arrange one for 350.Minuses: the public areas of the hotel are pretty shabby-looking.Room walls are thin, so you get noise both from the street and from other guests. It was cold at night, and the room had no heat (although perhaps they would have brought me a heater if I had asked). The bathroom worked well-enough, but there were some oddities (why is there a large bucket underneath the shower head?). If you are in Delhi between flights, then you shouldprobably pick a hotel that is closer to the airport.My impression is that this hotel was once terrible, and thatit has gotten much better under new management. It still has some ways to go until it is actually nice, butI was satisfied with my stay. They delivered exactly what they promised, at the price (60 US) that I had been looking for. On the other hand, I have heard that this hotel charges foreignerssignificantly more than locals, and the other reviews on this site seem to confirm this. If you are interested in staying here, I would advise getting a hindi speaker to make the reservation for you. "
megha sheraton ,Great place to stay We have a wonderful stay at this hotel recently. We were picked up at the airport which was fantastic and driven straight to the hotel to catch up on some sleep. The next nmorning we spoke to the Manager of the hotel who then boked us a car and driver and accomodation for the next 2 weeks travel around northern India. It was simply a wonderful trip and just so easy thanks to the staff at the Megha Sheraton. The hotel is very clean and very friendly with value for money and a very safe area. I would recommend it to anyone and would advise you to talk to the Megha tours operators and get them to organise your holiday for a fraction of the price we were quoted in Australia for the same trip. 
megha sheraton ,"Ok for its price Background: Paid USD65 for my parents and me to stay for one Sat night. Review: For its price, it is a rather good option. It's abt 4km away from Connaught Place (where the action is), but cabs/auto rickshaws are easily available outside the hotel. The hotel, although located within a residential area, looks safe enough. The manager/owner of the hotel was also kind to drop us for dinner at a nearby location. The only grumble i have about this place is that i spent the first 5 mins in the room killing cockroaches! The toilet was not in a good condition and the pillow cases are stained and lumpy. Verdict: It's a place to stay only if you are really low on cash, not afraid of insects and is totally no-frill. "
megha sheraton ,"Good service reasonable rates humble but correct accomodations We spent four nights at the Megha Sheraton. The hotel would be too basic for many people's tastes, but at 2000 Rs it was an excellent value and served our needs just fine. You won't see many foreigners in Old Rajender Nagar, but being in an &quot;authentic&quot; neighborhood was part of the appeal. We used the airport pickup/dropoff service (four trips total) and recommend it.The biggest attraction is the tourist assistance provided by manager Naresh and the a/c hotel cars and drivers that are available for hire. Naresh's service is great, his advice is excellent, and the rates are VERY reasonable. We hired one of the hotel cars for the day (7 hrs for 700 Rs) for a tour of Delhi and a quick drive by the sights of New Delhi. (Three of those hours were actually on a bicycle rickshaw arranged by our driver.) Naresh also arranged a tour of Agra (daytrip by train, with car/driver for the day).We had Indian breakfasts in the little restaurant at the adjacent sister hotel Madonna. Western breakfast also available. "
megha sheraton ,Excellent service We arrived to Delhi without too many plans and didn't really know what to expect from our stay. The Megha Sheraton is a good starting point for any journey in the northern parts of India. Thanks to Mr. Naresh Bhatia (the hotel's manager) our two weeks in India were some of the best weeks we have ever experienced. He organized a fantastic tour for us through Rajasthan and Agra (Taj Mahal). We had a private car + driver with us and saw some very beautiful places. All promises were kept and everything was according to expectations. We can warmly recommend the Megha Sheraton for you. 
megha sheraton ,"Mega good service!! This hotel is such a find! As a single woman, life can be difficult in a foreign country. But not at Hotel Megha Sheraton. I was brought here by an Indian friend and from the moment I arrived, I was treated with the utmost respect and kindness. Everything was provided for me, unlimited Chai and Indian coffee and interesting chats with the affable owner, Mr. Naresh Bhatia. His kindness and personal service are second to none. Nothing is too much trouble and honesty and friendliness are the keynotes of this home away from home. I always felt safe and secure. The room service is prompt and freindly. The room service waiters never hassle for tips and for me this is a first for India. Anything I wanted was available to me. My business cards were made for me on the same day as my CD was sent out from the hotel. I felt totally satisfied with all this hospitality. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and in India and I would honestly rate Hotel Megha Sheraton as No.1!!! Also, the food sent by room service was always delicious and fresh. What more can I say? "
megha sheraton ,"Megha Sheraton - Value for money We contacted the proprietor through email with apprehensions after having searched the net . Mr. Bhatia responded quickly with the rates and availability of the rooms. The rate was Rs. 1800 for an A/C room and sufficient to accommodate our two kids, aged 11, 6 years. We opted to be picked up from the airport. We were picked up from the airport and reached the hotel which is located in a residential area in about 45 minutes. The rooms are clean and tidy. Mr Bhatia arranged for our tour to Agra and Jaipur which we enjoyed thoroghly. Downside: The hotel does not have an in house restaurant but food is made available through the nearby sister Hotel Madonna "
metropolis tourist home ,a place where leisure and comfort coincides. it's a wonderful place to stay and enjoy the city. at the end of the day u get a good food and a lovely place to sleep. 
metropolis tourist home ,"Great stay !! Date 19th June, 2009We booked the room , market facing in the bustling street. The hotel is nice and has homely comforts. Moreover, the in house restaurant is the best in the area. We felt safe and comfortable. Highly recomended. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Not luxurious but excellent for Paharganj This is not a destination hotel. You wouldn't go to Delhi just to stay there. But if you like Paharganj or at least its convenience for the train station, metro, etc., Metropolis is about as good as it gets. Be sure to request rooms 109, 110, or 111. They are in an entirely different league from all of the others.Paharganj is bustling and virtually none of its hotels are quiet, and this is no exception, but with the a/c running it's manageable.Also, do not ask the front desk to arrange pick-ups, cars, etc. for you as they will charge nearly double what others in Paharganj charge. I bargained them down for one particular trip but I had to start over every time I returned to the front desk to confirm or change the time, with the attendant not believing I had bargained it down with someone else before. There is a travel agency immediately across from the front door of Metropolis that will give you much more reasonable prices for everything. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Filthy absolutely filthy! I've been eating at the Metropolis for years, but hadn't stayed there since it used to be a cheap but quality hotel for backpackers back in 1993. The reason I eat there is that it has an alcohol licence (the only place in Parharganj, that i know of), and although a bit expensive for India, the food is good, the beer is chilled and both the downstairs and rooftop restaurant tend to attract a decent crowd. It is a great place to meet people or to have a business lunch.Both the hotel staff and restaurant staff always were, and still are, extremely hospitable, polite and very helpful when it comes to getting tickets confirmed or booked, organising things and so forth. The staff are great.So, it was with this in mind and travelling to Delhi for the first time with my newly acquired wife, i booked in for a double, en suite room room with television.Now, what we got was indeed a room, with a double bed, television, en suite bathroom, AC and a fridge....but the room clearly hadn't been cleaned since I last stayed there in 1993. The fridge was worse than the fridge that my mate Dave used to have in his student house shared with 9 other stoners, and both myself and my wife preferred to stay out of the bathroom. It was a complete horror show. It didn't need cleaning - it was way past that stage - it needed to be completely burnt out and started over again.Having raved about Delhi to my wife, i was quite embarrassed to have taken her there. We only stayed the one night, and unless somthing changes there, given the choice of cheaper and better quality rooms available through Parharganj, i am not likely to stay there again.You will still find me up on the roof top restaurant in the evenings though. Stop by and say hi. "
metropolis tourist home ,"The Best choice !!! My mate and I stayed here Three times during our time in India, we tried a variety of rooms, ranging from okay too &quot;Top shelf&quot; for the $$$$.. oops Rs.Rooms were all clean, as well as bedding, although the usual Delhi plumbing rumbles from time to time.The Rooftop restaurant had more than a few visits from us, each time sampling something different, with no complaints.Breakfast was always a pleasant experience, not only the food but also the helpfullness of the staff... Very charming, courteous and always willing to help with directions, language translation etc etc.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to any friend or budget traveller looking for a very safe and trustworthy place to stay. Everyone From the Front Reception to the Sharma family management, are exceptionally friendly and proffessional. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Noisy scruffy but a real taste of Delhi The Metropolis provided a realistic introduction to India for the first-time visitor. The Metropolis is in the maelstrom of the lively market district, with all the colour, noise, dirt, bustle and confusion that that entails. A shock to those used to well-ordered suburbs, but exciting and a real taste of India.Our room was small, scrufffy with temperamental air conditioning, of no character and very noisy - packs of barking dogs as well as the street hubbub! Avoid a room at the front if you can.The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful, and the restaurants - breakfast downstairs, lunch and dinner upstairs - in the open air or under cover upstairs as you chose - provided a variety of excellent food.We survived a week there - it proved a good base for exploring the city and we came to feel at home. Nevertheless, on our return to Delhi for our last nights in India we did chose a more expensive hotel in the south of Delhi to ensure sound sleep, though we did return to enjoy a last lunch at the upstairs restaurant.Given that you don't go to India to experience the anodyne, this hotel is good value. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Disappointing experience This was our second stop over in Delhi so we decided to upgrade ourselves from the previous guesthouse in the middle of Pahar Ganj, and chose this hotel based on appearance.Despite booking our stay using the hotel website, and receiving email confirmation, we were annoyed to find the night manager had no knowledge of our reservation when we finally arrived at 01.00 am. However he did manage to find us a room (albeit on the small side, but we were in no position to argue as this was all that was left). Our room was fairly clean but had obviously been well used, and the whole hotel could do with a spruce up and although we were given a discount for the inconvenience at check-in, we did not feel that this booking gave value for money. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Shabby place The hotel is well located in Paharganj, a lively quarter in Delhi. The rooms are not very nice, with poor lighting and dirty-looking bathrooms. Our room was even very noisy, as we could hear our neighbor in the bathrooms next door, spitting, toilet noises and the lot. Breakfast was not on the roof but in the hotel lobby. Avoid the pancakes, mine had a terrible taste of egg... "
metropolis tourist home ,"Better than reviews We thought this hotel was the best to the Paranga (main bazzar) region and a little more expensive for good reason. If u want cheap and cheerful then try the Lord Krishna, if not here was good, a/c not noisy, big clean room and sheets and towels. Will do a deal if not busy and airport taxi only 300R, much less than out previous 'budget' (smylee inn - dont go there) hotel that charged 520R for our pick up.Lively and best place to stay in Delhi to experience real city life. Haggle hard, but dont be mean and enjoy the surroundings. plus the metro is just over the road and only 6R to Connaught place. "
metropolis tourist home ,"nice hotel I've just stayed at this hotel and felt obliged to write a review so you know what you're getting. My friend and I spent quite a while reading reviews of this and other hotels in the mid range of the lonely planet, and there were good and bad reviews for each place, it was difficult to make a choice.The hotel is at the better end of the bazaar, where the street is a bit wider and not as grimy. Its still the bazaar though, so its dirty and busy all the time, so be prepared for that. Our room was a very large room at the top, it was quiet, with AC, a couple of fans, and even a fridge. The room itself was ok, plain with no character, but sheets and walls were clean. The staff were the friendliest that i came across in India, and seemed interested in helping us with advice on various things. We ate at the restaurants upstairs and down, and thought the food was good too. This place is by no means the Ritz, but for Delhi i think its really ok. MY first night in Delhi was spent in a smaller, cheaper hotel in the middle of the bazaar and it was quitre a nasty experience, a tiny room which felt very dirty. "
metropolis tourist home ,"Overpriced bad location I stayed at the Metropolis Tourist Home in november 2006 and didn't like the place at all. The rooms are clean, but there are no windows, no hot water and the airconditioning is very loud and doesn't really work. The rooms do have a fan aswell, but I was afraid it would come down from the ceiling and since i was lying underneath it....... The rooftop restaurant is good. But the worst thing about the hotel I found was the location. I thought Paharganj was cramped with hotels and guesthouses. People constantly hassle you. If I would return to Delhi (which I don't think I will) I would stay somewhere in the southern part of town. It is further from all the sightseeing spots, but in a hectic place as Delhi I think the relative calmness of a suburb is a necessarity. "
metropolis tourist home ,"overpriced and overhyped I have been to the Metropolis tourist home in the Paharganj area since i wanted a mid range place and this one was supposed to be one the best in this category according to Lonely planet.I paid 1400 rs/night(24 euros) for a very mediocre room poorly furnished. There were no amenities at all in the bathroom, there was no hot water most of the time and the shower pressure was really weak.It was impossible to adjust the air con since it was broken.They give you only one sheet(good thing that i had mine) .There was a tiny tv.On the good side, the room was clean and big and the rooftop restaurant is good.Overall i had the feeling that this place was overpriced(2star price for what is really a backpacker guesthouse) and i will probably not come back to this hotel. "

oberoi new delhi ,"Great Service I stayed at Oberoi last month for a training workshop and was floored by the service and hospitality of the hotel staff. The facilities were superb and arrangements awesome. The staff would always greet you with folded hands and a &quot;Namaste&quot; - irrespective of where and how many times you met them during a day.The cleanliness of the hotel was immaculate as well. The conference rooms, where we spent most of our time, were well maintained and comfortable even for a group of 60.Depending on the room you had, you could have a view of the lush green Delhi Golf Club - this amount of greenery in the heart of an Indian city is unparalleled.The food was great and covered the entire spectrum of Indian, Eastern (e.g. Chinese) and Western (e.g. continental) food options. Although we ate at special buffets organised for us, the one time I ate in a restaurant - the experience was equally great. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Loved it! We had a great time at the hotel. Service was great, the conceirge was really helpful. Presentation and location of the hotel is amazing. "
oberoi new delhi ,Delhi at its best The entry lobby is nicely decorated. The staff is very supportive and smiling. The food is of the great taste and the rooms - big and warm. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Only Hotel I ever stayed in with a Butler Service I spend the last day of my stay in India at the the Oberoi for a bit of luxury and relaxation. In spite of this being primarily a business hotel I enjoyed my stay here very much. I got to know various services previously unknown to me here - such as the butler service in the hotel rooms or the remote (handed to the guest at the pool) for calling service. And in contrary to many other hotels I have stayed at in India, people at this hotel is able to answer for themselves instead of always having to ask some senior person before giving a qualified answer. Rooms and food are excellent. "
oberoi new delhi ,Loved the service and cleanliness The service was perfect. everyhting was good. the behaviour of staff was very co-operative. We enjoyed each and every second at hotel. 
oberoi new delhi ,"An excellent hotel Just got back from a 9 day stay at The Oberoi and I have to say we could not fault this hotel. This hotel is an oasis of calm in a chaotic city. We had a room overlooking the golf course so I cannot comment on what it must be like at the front of the hotel where there is quite a busy road. Breakfasts were superb. Security was reassuringly tight, although we were concerned about why it needed to be so tight, but you only have to look how close Delhi is to the border of Pakistan to get your answer The hotel staff are all uniformly charming especially on the concierge desk where they will organise anything for you. Great pool. Our room rate included airport transfers; very much essential as dealing with Delhi taxi drivers is a skill you acquire! You cannot walk from this hotel to anywhere in Delhi, you have to take a taxi. Our final bill was a bit eye-popping as drinks, laundry etc don't come cheap at the Oberoi! I would recommend this hotel unreservedly, but wild horses won't drag us back to the dubious delights of New Delhi. "
oberoi new delhi ,Big name but rooms outdated A classic in Delhi. Overall nice hotel but they need to upgrade their rooms. Other facilities excellent. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Great Service Wonderful service and although it is not known to be a fancy and luxurious as the other oberoi's in India we thought it was still way above most over city hotels. The staff is attentive, management and restaurant staff greeted you by name. They even helped us arrange taxi for outings and plan our daily activities. "
oberoi new delhi ,New Delhi's finest This is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at. Service was great and the grounds are an oasis from the grime of New Delhi. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Oberoi Delhi fantastic service and food with 5 star property but rooms a little tired The service matches the best hotels in the middle east and far east. Restaurants are very good and so is the pool and spa area. The rooms are 5 star but could be a little better - they are a touch tired and the bathroom could be bigger and better appointed. However, I would certainly go back again. "
oberoi new delhi ,"The best hotel in New Delhi I have been fortunate to stay in a few hotels in Delhi, including the Taj Mahal and Oberoi New Delhi. I don't have any hesitation in saying that the Oberoi is the winner in that battle, hands down. I am a seasoned traveller and I have never felt so passionately about reviewing hotels before, but feel the need to rave about the Oberoi experience. The rooms were lovely, the service was unparalleled, the food/drink establishments were excellent and leisure facilities fantastic. Stay here... you won't be disappointed! "
oberoi new delhi ,"An Oasis in Delhi I have been coming to Delhi for five years now, and I always stay at the Oberoi. The staff is so attentive and courteous, and the condition of the hotel is impeccable. In my mind, there is no question that this is the place to stay. "
oberoi new delhi ,"A fine hotel but not as good as other Oberoi hotels Spent 3 nights here with my family and we were more than happy with the luxury rooms and the facilties. The hotel had a great buzz with many locals visiting the restaurants and cafe for lunch and dinner. The restaurants are excellent but very expensive. We avoided the Japanese restaurant for that reason. The staff are quite helpful but obviously tip driven. Check in and paying the bills were slow. Overall this hotel lacked the superb high standards of the Oberois in Agra, Jaipur and Ranthambore. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Hospitality is the name of the game I have stayed a few times now at this Oberoi (on Dr. Zakir Hussain Marg) in New Delhi. The most recent being May 25-28, 2009. They were there to pick me up at the Airport (DEL) in a car and driver provided by Avis. Driver was courteous and a very careful driver. My room was ready, clean, internet ready and complimentary, with roses, fruits, chocolates in a room that overlooked the Delhi Golf Course (8th Floor). Food was great at the 360. Security was impressive with luggage and body scanners.Staff bent out of their way to be helpful. In particular, the concierge, despite the lack of support from the local Lufthansa (LH) office, was able to help me redo my booking with a marathon series of phone calls. Net result was that I was able to leave DEL a day early albeit on Austrian (OS) as opposed to LH, which proved to be a blessing in disguise anyway. "
oberoi new delhi ,"The best business hotel I've ever stayed in Everything about my stay here for a fortnight was PERFECT. Staff, food, Pool, Gym, Room, Butler, Everything. Simple as that! "
oberoi new delhi ,Excellent service The staff at this hotel are exceptionally courteous and are always at your service. The hotel has a beautiful poolside and the food is awesome. The breakfast spread is amazing with combination of both continental and traditional indian food. Even the simplest of the menu is made to perfection. Try the Dal Makhani and you would be transported to a different world. The rooms are spacious and well lit and the king size beds are far too comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel for any kind of visitor. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Tranquility in New Delhi Very well organised and service focused hotel. Even though it gets a lot of business traffic there are a variety of restaurants and pools so that it is a good base for exploring Delhi.

A great place to stay for a special treat. "
oberoi new delhi ,"great service The Oberoi was one of the citys first luxury hotels. The exterior still bears the 60's-70's design, and is a bit dated, but the Oberoi in Delhi is a hotel with a reputaion.The rooms overlook the greens of the Delhi Golf club on one side, and Humayuns tomb (a world heritage site) on the other.Baan Thai and Taipan, two of its restaurants serving oriental cuisine, are very popular and serve great food.The hotel is in charge of the lighting up of `Humayun's tomb', which is a world heritage monument, and nearby. The lights come on post sunset and its a fabulous view from some of the hotel rooms. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Excellent service but a bit too plain I like the understated service of Oberoi, but the Oberoi, Delhi is a drab looking property from outside and a bit sleepy from inside. Would recommend it though if you are on a business visit. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Exceptional Overall I always prefer the gorgeous but in simple way of behaving. I found it in Oberoi New Delhi. Their welcome desk to the final day bell boy services, are really deserves the appreciation without asking any question. I found it exceptionally good for its money exchange, travel, in room services, facilities to a business traveler and food offerings to the guests. Swimming pool and health center is really good and state-of-art to attract guests. To me it is the SMILE from STAFFS all around that invites me for the second time. But only complain it is overbook always. But I miss its golf course view and sky line limits. It is really amazing. "
oberoi new delhi ,unexpectedly bad service.. very bad It was a dim-sum lunch at the roof top restaurant at oberoi with my family of around 12 ppl.. so there were around 8 ppl taking the dim-sum buffet and 4 ordering Ala crate. when the starter were being served one of my brothers took a bite from me who had ordered Ala crate so this lady who is apparently the manager there( a very bad 1) comes and tells him &quot; Sir please restrain from eating as sharing is not allowed&quot; I mean what the [--] is wrong with u this is unacceptable how can u ask ur guest to not taste something and use this language .. I am a regular at this place but after this have decided to never go back there again... the manager is from mumbai was very rude and knows nothing about hospitality.. very sad didnt expect this from oberoi's. and will make sure to spread this around and inform about this information to as many ppl as i can.... 
oberoi new delhi ,Enjoyed stay at Oberoi Delhi The hotel was a breath of fresh air. Very clean lines and a cooling atmosphere. The bedrooms were beautifully appointed. The meal in the restaurant was a little disappointing but the breakfast the following morning more than made up for it. Unfortunately I. only had time to stay one night 
oberoi new delhi ,"terrific service My wife and me stayed for 4 days in March 2009. The hotel is outstanding and we have never experienced such incredible service before. Each room had personalised butler service (including packing / unpacking!!!). Hotel staff at all venues were very cordial and helpful. Infact, the crew at the 360 degrees coffe shop made dining a better experience. They were always smiling and helping us with selection etc. Also, i must mention the housekeeping staff who were brilliant. Infact, my wife left her t-shirt behind which was returned in my next trip. The food at the 360 degrees was simply outstanding. I think the finest breakfast spread ive ever had. We were just expecting nibbles but breakfast was a delicious spread spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc. Restaurants are great. Taipan, on the roof, is very smart.The rooms are very comfortable with a variety of pillows to choose for your comfots. Although, internet was not complimentary and too too expensive. Wish the same was made complimentary, especially for frequent visitors like me.Overall, excellent value and great comfort. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on a business trip. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Just amazing service and hotel a combination of excellence and elegance One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff were exceptional with a level of service that I have so far found hard to beat. Not over the top, just attentive with the sense that to serve was an honour. I loved the fact that everyone smiled at you in a gracious way The food was good; the breakfasts were excellent in particular. The spa and swimming pool (indoor) were a haven of peace. In the chaos that is New Delhi, congratulations need to go to the manager and his team for maintaining such a high standard. Could so do with Oberoi in Canada. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Oberoi probably still the best business hotel in New Delhi Oberoi is probably still the best business hotel in delhi. Great restaurants, especially 360, newly renovated gym, spa and pool and unbeatable location next to the golf club. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Loved the cozy bed I stayed at the Oberoi with my uncle when he had visited Delhi in 2007. The bed was really cozy and the mattresses gave you the feeling that you are sinking into it. I dont think I've slept so well in my life ever. Though the rooms were slightly towards the smaller side, the grandeur of the Oberoi is unmatched. Also, the Oberoi is a paradise for luxury brands: Louis Vitton, Gucci, Bvlgari "
oberoi new delhi ,"Business Travel to Delhi A good and convenient hotel for business travellers.The rooms are business traveller friendly with all the facilities that one requires to conduct business efficiently - internet access, business centre and CNN and BBC World television channels offered to keep in touch with international news.The staff are very friendly - in true Indian style and always welcoming and always willing to go an extra mile with its service.A good hotel that I recommend for all travellers. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Paradise in the centre of chaos I travelled to New Delhi at the end of March on a business trip and selected the Oberoi Hotel on Trip Advisor recommendations. It is the most fantastic luxurious hotel with first class service at all times and thoroughly deserves it's five star rating. When I arrived in the early hours of the morning after an over-night flight I was immediately given a room &quot;to rest and relax in&quot; until my designated room was ready. My booking was for that night but I was moved into my room within an hour of arriving. It was on the fifth floor of the hotel overlooking New Delhi golf course and the &quot;old&quot; pool and was beautifully furnished and pristine clean. During my week's stay there the bed linen was changed every day, the towels twice and sometimes three times per day and the bathroom cleaned both morning and night. I sampled meals in all the restaurants and the quality of food was superb. All in all I felt pampered and spoiled during my stay there. One minor point is the cost of drinks whether it be wine, beer or bottled water. The charges are eye-watering but are similar in all the hotels in the area.From the very efficient door/security people to reception staff, waiters, housekeeping staff and cleaners the level of service is truly excellent. Tipping is actively discouraged during your stay at the Oberoi (you can tip at the end of you like) and several times when I tried to tip for excellent service it was politely refused unlike at several other five star hotels which I visited where hands were out all the time.The &quot;new&quot; Oberoi pool looks amazing, set in landscaped gardens surrounded by shrubs and trees and the pool service is again superb with iced bottled water and cool towels being provided at regular intervals. The only downside is that the pool has no handrails, the steps are not very visible and apart from nearly falling myself I noticed several other bathers having similar problems. I agree that it would not look as amazing with rails sticking up but maybe the steps could be made clearer.Outside this haven of tranquility is utter chaos both in traffic, standard of driving and beggars. I found it quite distressing to witness the level of poverty in New Delhi but when I asked my business contacts about it they just shrugged.If you have to stay in New Delhi then I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great Hotel Wonderful Service! I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Oberoi New Delhi twice during a recent visit to India. On both ocassions we had a very well appointed Executive Suite whcih although a little dated was more than adequate enough. The new pool area is awesome and the service there si as good as in the rest of the hotel; bottled waters and sunscreen included. We spent a total of 5 nights at the hotel and so we gfot to enjoy msot of the facilities inclduing the Threesixty and Travertino restaurants, service and food were great at both of them. the spa was also very enjoyable and the prices were not too bad. i would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if I ever have the chance; although the imperial hotel looks very nice I doubt the service would eb up to apr with the Oberoi. "
oberoi new delhi ,Wnderful and worth going again because of the hospitality and service I went with my wife and stayed there for two days and one night and it was really a very good experience. We had a very good experience of good hospitality and best Services ever dreamt. The staff was so humble and well behaved and mannered that you cannot expect anything better than this. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Good business hotel service makes the difference I stayed here for 3 nights in a Luxury Room. I used to stay here on business in the late 1990's, when it was the top hotel in Delhi. The business service is still excellent, but the rooms feel shabby &amp; the Indian food is very average; it's great as a business hotel but may be disappointing if you're looking for something special on a holiday.The hotel is extremely well located, which is one of its best features given the bad traffic in Delhi; it was convenient for me to visit both north &amp; south Delhi. The front desk, concierge &amp; business center staff were in general excellent - professional &amp; efficient. However, the concierge did not seem to know much about shopping destinations (I asked how long it would take to get to a few different places &amp; ended up calling the stores directly myself) - perhaps they really only get business requests? The service in the cafe was not good - slow &amp; unenthusiastic, though friendly enough - while the food was the worst on my 2-week trip in India, heavy &amp; bland. The room service Indian food was only marginally better.My room was pretty clean but felt shabby, with worn woodwork, light blue carpeting &amp; a very small bathroom with a narrow combination tub/shower. There was also a faint odor of cigarette smoke. In all, serviceable but forgettable, though the open view over the pool &amp; park next door was nice.In summary, while on holiday I would still choose to stay at The Imperial, which has character, feels more updated &amp; has excellent Indian food. But it's hard to fault The Oberoi for business needs. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Awesome One of the best hotels in the city. It has everything that a customer would ask for great shops, great food and amazing rooms. "
oberoi new delhi ,Very comfortable big city hotel with all the expected amenities A very high end city hotel with some resort ammenities. Everything you would expect from Oberoi. Prices comparable to hotels of this caliber in major North American and European cities. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Fantastic city hotel Expensive but perfect. Impecable service - the staff always seem to remember you, great restaurants, comfortable bedroom with great view of Delhi. (make sure you get a room in one of the higher floors). Fantastic pool to relax by. They even provide guests with suntan lotion! and a bell to call for assitance. If you want to stay in the hotel has a selcetion of free DVDs to watch. "
oberoi new delhi ,loved the foodspaservice and the room Just before new year i was down in delhi and like always stayed in the oberoi which is the prime 5 star hotel in delhi.I always enjoy stayin in th sweet as they have one of the best sweets in india.Their resturants serve amazing food and i always enjoy the spa..The location is also perfect .... 
oberoi new delhi ,"Needs some refurbishment but still great A year on from my last visit, the New Delhi Oberoi is still a great hotel, but the rooms are looking tired now. I saw rooms on three floors (2,3,4) and all were similarly down-at-heel, frankly. Bed was still very comfortable - perhaps the mattresses are replaced regularly - and everything worked, but dents and chips in the woodwork and scratched, worn furniture are hard to ignore. Inevitably (after the event at Mumbai) security is much tighter, but is conducted with the usual grace and politeness. This year I stuck to the 360 restaurant, having been unimpressed by the Italian and Chinese restaurants last time. As I was only there for four days, there was enough variety on offer, but it would get tedious after a week or so. Room rates MUCH lower than a year ago... push for a deal at the moment and you should manage under £150 per room night with breakfast and internet included. Excellent value at that rate, but how long it'll be so low is anyone's guess. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Expensive Local Line Charges The Oberoi is a wonderful hotel with good rooms, great service and fine food. But local line charges are 200 rupees per minute or $4 per minute. That is a higher rate than charged by other Oberoi Hotels in India. The rates apply to any international collect call or international credit card call. These rates are only known if you inquire and management is rather defensive regarding these charges. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great hotel This is exactly the sort of place you need to retreat to in the bustle that is Delhi. It's conveniently located, well-appointed, clean and has superb staff. I've stayed here for a total of three nights, and enjoyed them all. The rooms are large and the beds comfortable. The hotel is also spotlessly clean. There are a variety of restaurants that you can dine in. There's an oriental one on the top floor (which I didn't eat in) a very good (if expensive) Italian on the ground floor, next to which is the 360 Restaurant which serves a huge array of different foods (all of which are of a good standard). The 360 restaurant is also where you have breakfast, and despite being a large space you are made to feel welcome and service is friendly and efficient. There is also a nice bar area just to the right of the main entrance. However, this is not open all day, which is a shame. The spa is tremendous. Well worth a visit! I would have no hesitation about staying here again. "
oberoi new delhi ,"World Class This has to be one of the best hotels in the world for business travellers. The service is amazing, rooms well appointed and very comfortable, facilities excellent, fantastic Spa run by Banyan Tree, and great restaurants. The location is also very convenient - not far from Connaught Place, Janpath, Khan Market etc. I have stayed here around 10-12 times and never have i been disappointed. Book ahead though - the lack of hotels in Delhi means prices can be unbelievably high at times. one negative - they do not have any loyalty reward program. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Doesn't live up to its name When you speak to anyone about luxury hotels in India, two names are invariably brought up: Taj and Oberoi -- in the context of how they set the standard. Even without such word of mouth, you would have certain expectations of 5 star hotels. Alas, Oberoi New Delhi falls short -- by either measure, and on many counts.First, I was surprised upon entering my room to see how dated it looked. It's well maintained but the furniture and fittings were evidently not recently installed. With its heavy wooden furniture and trimmings so typical of hotels 2 eras ago, the room was entirely incongruous with the common areas (lobby, gym, pool, restaurants) which were clearly refurbished in recent times and sport clean modern lines. I guess they decided to spend the renovation budget on the high visibility areas?Second, there was neither toothbrushing nor shaving kit in the room! I had consciously omitted to bring my toiletries on the assumption that every 5-star hotel would provide its guests with certain standard items. Not this one. Sure, housekeeping promptly brought me a toothbrushing kit upon request, but it shouldn't have been an on-request item in the first place. Then, upon wanting to iron out some creases in my business shirt, I discovered that room didn't have ironing facilities either. At that point, I just decided to live with a creased shirt.Now, the thing *REALLY* got my goose happened in the hotel's all-day restaurant, &quot;threesixty&quot;. Obviously, the restaurant manager told the staff, &quot;We're really proud of new special promotional Japanese set dinner -- be sure to recommend it to every single guest.&quot; Or more likely, he said, &quot;These are lean times and we need to squeeze every dime out of our guests, so plug this expensive $80 set meal like your life (or livelihood) depended on it!&quot; Either way, he must have forgotten to add, &quot;But exercise some restraint and discretion; don't [-] off any guests in the process.&quot; 'Cos, boy, did they hard-sell or what. After the third waiter who walked by my table tried to convince me how I really wanted to order the &quot;special&quot; instead of ala carte, I was on the brink of saying something rude or walking out. And when they finally gave up and allowed me to order a main course ala carte, the waiter practically forced me (&quot;You don't understand, sir...&quot;) to order an appetizer to go with it!! This, in a 5-star hotel.Stay there again? Not if I can help it. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great stay made possible by a superb staff I spent 4 nights here; two over a weekend and two during the week. The management is obviously doing something right with this hotel as every employee seems eager to meet your immediate needs and even attempts to anticipate them. No waiting to check in or check out - every station is fluidly staffed as required to make sure no one is kept waiting. This is not an inexpensive hotel but the given the level of convenience and service provided by the staff, the quality of the room accomodations and hotel ammenities it is a good value for the price. Fresh fruit daily in the room along with butler and shoe shine service was a nice touch. The hotel provides nice cars and great drivers at a price about three times higher than a taxi, but you do get seat belts and airconditioning and at least when first arriving, the comfort of knowing you will be met by a hotel representative at the airport and introduced to your driver who will safely and reliably get you to your hotel - in Delhi's traffic, heat and smog this is no small consideration. Before retiring your first night, make sure you check out your breakfast options since the hotel is often late to open its restaurants. The room service option is probably the best choice for early risers. "
oberoi new delhi ,ok it is a great hotel and the attention to detail is second to none but i wish they could not be so stiff and lighten up a bit i had just come from the taj in mumbai and they were so much friendlier.also if you book on the internet be careful you only book once.they tried to charge me for two rooms .they need to sought that out.they got quite agressive with me and it spoilt my stay 
oberoi new delhi ,"Top-notch hotel I stayed at the Oberoi several times this year and thought that it was an excellent hotel. Attentive service, good restaurants, nicely-appointed room. Either side of the hotel has nice views, and the spa/health club is excellent. Close to shopping and business centers. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great start and in finish in city haven We stayed here at the start and end of our tour of India. A modern business hotel with good attention to detail and professionalism (including welcome/ welcome back letter and complimentary bottle of wine on both arrivals). But the staff were not as friendly as in the Oberoi leisure resorts. We had a good size luxury room on the 8th floor room with views over the golf course (rooms at the front can be noisy due to location near a busy road). The bathroom was a little on the small side though and had no separate shower. Great butler service - a few minor room issues (for example a faulty hairdryer) and the need to replace a flat camera battery all resolved immediately and with minimum fuss. The jet lag massage was a great way to unwind after a long flight and the hotel has installed a great new pool in full sun. Whilst there do not seem to be very many sunbeds for the size of the hotel we always found the pool area to be very quiet (probably due to the predominance of business as opposed to leisure guests). The concierge also arranged some great tailor-made excursions with an excellent English speaking guide (Shipra Rathi). The main restaurant (360) had a huge selection of buffet and a la carte (Indian, Japanese and International) for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the lobster was one of the best we have ever tasted. Good service too. We also had a fabulous meal in the top floor Taipan Chinese restaurant. We were not impressed by the Travertino Italian restaurant - food quality okay but the service did not match the other restaurants. "
oberoi new delhi ,"A comfortable Oasis to start or finish your trip Hotel situated on New Delhi Golf course. A modern purpose built business hotel. Set in own grounds and not located in a 'walk around area'.Ensure a room at rear as if at front road noise.Furnishings heavy quality comfortable rooms. Excellent service in rooms .Very pleasant staff.Hotel restaurants '360' poor and plainItalian ,blandChinese, excellentIndian very goodA good oasis to start or finish your trip.Unless you have a reason two nights in Delhi at start of trip are enough. "
oberoi new delhi ,A great pleasure It is graet pleasure to date with my girlfriend i n oberoi hotel. It was very clean and beautiful hotel for such purpose. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Fantastic Hotel We only stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as it was the first destination of our 8 week round the world honeymoon.We found the hotel to be very good, nice size rooms, beautiful decor and very good restaurants. The staff were friendly and polite.I would recommend this hotel "
oberoi new delhi ,"Expensive but great Paid more for a single night than I've paid in my life before.With dinner and breakfast it was around $600US!! But the service was perfect and the food amazing. The pool's pretty good too.However I have to say that for the money I would expect fellating on arrival and a slightly posher pool. Also the exterior looks like a 1950's council block.Having said that it was certainly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in and if you want a nice night in a plush hotel after backpacking around India for a couple of weeks I thoroughly recommend it if you've got the cash.Breakfast was the best aspect. An amazing buffet and international stuff that normally we'd turn our noses up due to the environment, local economy etc, but on this occasion we decided balls to it.Unfortunately if you want a posh place to stay in Delhi to finish of your holiday your options are limited.If you're there on business then go for it. Price is the only thing against. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good business hotel The New Delhi Oberoi is fine, you won't have any regrets staying here, but you won't remember it as a particularly special hotel either. It's a fairly typical 1960s building with a shopping arcade attached to the lobby, smallish rooms, decent service. We found the restaurants very busy, and so a little slow. The food was good. The gym is pretty good. All in all you might as well be in Manhattan, and maybe that's the point. Internet service is slow. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great Luxury Hotel Great service, the staff is amazing , will take care of everything- Top rate. The room is nice and the decor is classy. The restaurant was great, food was really delicious and the design of the restaurant was striking. The hotel and restaurants are very happening at night with a up-market clientele . Definitely the place to be and be seen. The hotel is in a great location away from a lot of noise. Quiet with a nice garden and pool area.Would definitely recommend when staying in New Delhi. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Business hotel good for a short stay I was participating in a large training programme at this hotel and stayed here for 2 nights. It seemed a little strange for the hotel to be right next to a flyover! However, having once entered the hotel, I was quite at peace. It has all the comforts of a business hotel without being in your face. The staff is efficient and friendly but not over friendly. I did have a few issues with my room but it was handled quickly and efficiently. The chinese restaurant is quite nice and they used to have a nice deli. It is not right in the city centre- bit of a cab ride really- so you might not be able to stumble home from the bars! "
oberoi new delhi ,"An excellent business hotel Thoroughly recommended as a business hotel. Great service, good restaurants and very comfortable rooms. Oberoi have clearly invested heavily in the property, in particular the new outside pool area.Would definitely consider this to be one of New Delhi's best hotels (after the Imperial). "
oberoi new delhi ,Excellent city hotel An excellent city hotel with wonderful restaurants. The staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous. An oasis of elegance and tranquitity in frenetic Delhi. Note all the Oberois have international plus in every room - very useful! 
oberoi new delhi ,"Nice but the hotel has problems Lobby, Restaurants, Pools and other public areas are very nice. The pool could use a few more chairs. The spa is smaller, with just one shower in the men’s locker area. The workout area is superb with excellent, brand new equipment.Rooms: The rooms have a musty smell. While everything in the room is nice and updated, I think the carpet needs replaced and is causing the smell. I viewed three rooms during our stay and they all have an odd smell. The views of the rooms that look at Humayan’s tomb were nice as were the pool/golf course views. The staff were not as nice as other Oberoi hotels. In addition, they were a little slow with requests for ironing board, room service, etc. Pool service was also slow. In addition, the drains in both of our rooms were broken and it took quite awhile for someone to come look. The restaurants were excellent in food and service. The lobby bar is not as nice as the 360 restaurant bar, use that one instead. The drinks there were top notch. Sunday brunch at 360 is excellent, as is all the food, including the Sushi. The internet is VERY expensive at 800 rupees per day ($20) and sometimes did not work. There were adapters in each room for foreign plugs. Overall, I would NOT stay at this hotel again, I would try the Taj Palace or Imperial. Our flight was not until 11 PM, they extended check out until 2 and offered to hold our bags until we were ready to go and let us use the facilities: Spa, pool, etc. until we were ready to leave. That was one plus of the hotel… "
oberoi new delhi ,"LOVED it My husband, daughter, and I stayed at the Oberoi New Delhi for 2 nights. We were so extremely impressed with the experience. The room was beautiful and the service was 110% outstanding. We couldn't sleep and checked emails at 3am. 2 persons were there to assist us with getting online and serving us a snack! My husband exercised, he was given a bottle of water, and they then offered to carry the water to the room for him! Everyone smiles and greets you, and you wont have to lift a finger for anything. They leave chocolates and bottled water in the room for you. The only very minor problem we encountered were the bed linens. The first night the pillows were dirty and the second night the linens were put on the bed not fully dried. Both problems were remedied. We really did not want to leave this place. "
oberoi new delhi ,"slightly disappointing.... Overall, this was quite disappointing and did not live up to what I would usually expect from an Oberoi hotel. Views from the 8th floor room were simply stunning, but the room itself was old and tired. Breakfast, although similar menu to other Oberoi hotels, was tasteless. The 'famed' 360 coffee shop was pretty crapola... but the bar was excellent with a great wine and drinks list. (the Bloody Marys were far too good!). The pool, gym and spa were astounding and Harish in the beauty salon does a great pedicure! Very buzzy, seemed like a great place to meet friends or work colleagues. lots of casual meetings seemed to be going on. "
oberoi new delhi ,"new pool is really nice I have stayed at the Oberoi several times and enjoyed it. The difference this time was that the new infinity pool has been opened - and it is really lovely though not very deep. Also there is a nice landscaped area around the pool, with sun loungers. If you sit there the staff will bring complimentary bottles of cold water.The &quot;old&quot; pool was closed as I think it is being re-done. But the indoor lap pool was still open.Two things I don't like about this hotel: the breakfast buffet is not a particularly good selection of food for the price charged, and the service at breakfast (bringing toast and butter) is pretty chaotic.Also the gym is too small for a hotel of this size, and it can be hard to get a machine early in the morning - and I was visiting during the off season.But all in all the Oberoi is a great hotel - very helpful and friendly staff, lovely rooms, and the 360 degree restaurant is fantastic (best pizza in town, for example). "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good Quality Hotel We stayed at the Oberoi Hotel at the beginning and end of our tour of North India and found the hotel to be a pleasant stay. We arrived early at the hotel and they arranged an early check with no issues. Breakfast had a good range and quality of food. The hotel is very business traveller orientated. The Italian restaurant was average, but of course hotel prices. The sunbathing/pool area was lovely, nice touch with the free water, suntan lotion and service button.The exterior of the hotel building does not do it justice inside. The location does not really allow you to wander around the local tourist sights.We also stayed at the Oberoi Hotel in Agra and Jaipur and they were far superior to Delhi on all accounts. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great Anniversary We stayed at the Oberoi Delhi on the 8th April to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary as part of our 2 week tour visiting family.All I can say about this hotel is - the service is fantastic. We where picked up from my aunties house in a quality car, where we had cold towels and mineral bottles to cool us down.Once arriving at the hotel, we where greeted by the staff with such style as they used our surname, which I like as it's nice and personal. Once stepping into the hotel, was greeted with a nice Indian tradition where one staff heled a diva in her hand and wished me and my husband a prosper and happy life... We where taken straight up to our room where we had a complementary cake, champagne, flowers and chocolates - which again was such a nice surprise. After we checked in the premier suite, I had a appointment booked at the beauty salon - which I have no complain about. Following my treatment, me and my husband had a body scrub and massage booked at the Banyan Tree spa (we both huge fans of Banyan Tree - especially after experiencing Maldives Banyan Tree). All I can say is wow - amazing with no faults at all...We dined at the Chinese restaurant - where the food was lovely, they kindly let us on the terrace for a romantic stroll where we where over looking the whole of Delhi (well part of it). Overall the stay was lovely - will definite recommend you to stay at this hotel. The bar is very trendy - also if you like shopping they have Gucci,Louis Vutton, Dior in the hotel - which was great for me as my husband bought me the watch I have been eyeing up for while :) Pricey but if you can afford worth it. :) "
oberoi new delhi ,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Oberoi We have just returned from a trip to Rajasthan &amp; stayed at the Oberoi both at the start &amp; at the end of our trip, a total of 3 nights. The Oberoi is a real oasis of calm in the middle of hectic New Delhi and whilst it is a short taxi ride from Connought Place (the big shopping area) it does overlook a huge green space &amp; the Golf course, making it feel very peaceful. One side of the hotel does overlook a busy road, so make sure you ask for the golf course view!The service at the Oberoi is wonderful and very personalised, despite it being a large hotel, and we had excellent response to any query made of the staff. Whilst very elegant and beautifully appointed it is also quite casual &amp; trendy, and the wonderful restaurant is a big attraction to well to do Delhi young crowd, making it buzzy &amp; fun. Reception staff were great, gave us very good restaurant/shopping recommendations &amp; you feel at home from the moment you step out of the car to be welcomed by the smiling uniformed doormen.In a nutshell, we loved it at the Oberoi &amp; would definitely stay there again. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great modern hotel in Delhi My wife and I were in New Delhi for New Year's Eve and stayed here. We've been to New Delhi many times, and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed at here. It's an excellent modern hotel with all the amenities you expect from an Oberoi property. The rooms are large, well decorated, and have flat screen TV.They also have great restaurants here. Taipan is rated the best in New Delhi - yummie Dim Sum. Three-Sixty has a great mix of cuisines - but the brunch buffet was over priced. We had wine at the enoteca, but did not try the cuisine.Not much nightlife in this hotel - very quiet and sedate. It is also a bit out of the way - the Taj Mansingh has a better location and nightlife. There is a Louis Vuitton store located in the shopping arcade. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great service lovely hotel I have stayed at a number of hotels in New Delhi over the last five years, and would return first to the Oberoi. The service is excellent, the rooms nicely appointed, the pool and gym top quality, and the breakfast buffet the best around. The location is fine, with views of what is a surprisingly green expanse of city. The prices... well, prices in 5 stars in New Delhi are out of control, so no matter where you go, get ready to pay through the nose. But if you are paying, you should get the kind of serice the Oberoi provides. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Nice business hotel in the city Nice business hotel. Conveniently located next to Humayun's Tomb, which was one of the reasons we chose to stay here. The other reason was that we were going to the Amarvilas in Agra, and we booked car transfers between the two hotels.Very nice view from our room. Large and comfy room with all the amenities. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Fabulous stay at the Oberoi This is by far the nicest hotel I have stayed in. I was in New Delhi very briefly for business and enjoyed every minute I spent at the Oberoi.Little things in the room, like the pillow selection menu, showed that this hotel is always trying little things to improve the guests' experience. The bed is amazingly comfortable and the shower pressure was fabulous. The food was excellent - both Indian and Italian. When I wanted to go do a little sightseeing, the staff was very helpful about recommending what I could see in the little time I had. When I asked if I could walk to Humayun's Tomb (distance-wise, it's only 1/2 km), they said no because I would have to cross a main highway - and then called a metered taxi for me that took me there, waited for me for over an hour and drove me back - for about $2 plus tip. At other hotels I have stayed at in Delhi (this was my 3rd time there), I was pressured to take high-priced hotel cars, but the Oberoi was too classy to try that. And yes, it is very expensive. (And yes, despite the high cost, internet is an additional charge, which was the one thing I had a problem with). But, if you book online and get lucky, you can find a 'run of the house' rate that, well, is better than the usual rate... but still about $300. "
oberoi new delhi ,"A nice hotel but outrageously expensive. I stayed two nights in this hotel in November, 2007. The room was beautiful, the hotel was really nice for sort of a business-oriented hotel, but in no way was it worth the $550 I was charged one night, and the $700 I was charged another, the first night being booked over a month before I stayed there.The service of the hotel staff was excellent, ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner and found it to be very good. But again, I'd say it's more of a $300 a night place at the rack rate that you should be able to get for less at a negotiated corporate rate. "
oberoi new delhi ,A great 5* hotel We started our trip to India in this hotel and thought it wonderful. We had a large and very quiet room overlooking the golf course. The food in the restaurents was good and the service excellent.If we return to Delhi this is the only hotel we would consider staying in. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Good hotel and helpful staff I agree with previous reviewers that the hotel is excellent but more business-like than other Oberoi hotels. The view from our window was lovely - we could see nothing but forest (looking down we could see the pool). The staff were particularly helpful as I got ill with gastroenteritis. They called the doctor, and on our final day provided a room to rest in before our flight (for no charge) after we had checked out, and made sure they brought me tea and biscuits (which I could not drink or eat unfortunately). The restaurant seemed very good, and breakfast was excellent. All in all, I am glad I got sick at the end of my trip and in a hotel like the Delhi Oberoi. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Fantastic experience but pricey I have stayed at this hotel more than once. The best part of returning is that the staff address you by your name. The experience begins with the pick-up at Delhi airport, the car is always there on time and the driver has a sign with your name on it. There is drinking water in the car which is a big relief. The check-in takes less than a minute, they have all the details, all you have to do is sign and let them get an impression of your credit card. Someone shows you the room, explains how things work while the luggage comes up. The rooms are always clean, everything works. The staff are polite, discreet and very helpful. Wireless internet access is available in the rooms by the hour or by the day at moderate prices (compared to the room rate). Usually there are complimentary fruits in the room. The check-out is quick and hassle-free and the airport drop is ready on time.The only drawback is the price. During the winter (November to March), the room rates are so high as to be almost unaffordable. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Haven in India Stayed at the Oberoi on my first business visit to India starting a two week journey throughout the country. Began with a limo pickup at the airport which was a blessing since it is havoc at the airports. The driver was beautifully professional and very considerate of our needs. The hotel was a haven in the midst of chaos and humid 100 degree temperatures. We were greeted with incredibly hospitable doormen, staff at check-in and shown our beautiful room. The beds, facilities, television, bathroom and amenities are all first class and the service is impeccable.The restaurants in the hotel are world class and food is excellent which you have to be extremely careful of in India. Very modern decor, clean and excellent choice of foods to choose from.Would highly recommend anyone stay there without an ounce of hesitation. It is no doubt one of the best if not the best hotel in New Delhi. "
oberoi new delhi ,Very Nice Place Went with a group to tour the golden triangle. This was a very nice place. Rooms were noce. Service was great. Loved the chocolate shop in the loby. Overall a very pleasent stay. 
oberoi new delhi ,"A disappointing stay We flew from Jodphur to New Delhi for an overnight stay before travelling on to Shimla the next day. Our trip had included stays in the Oberoi Mumbai and Udaivillas in Udaipur and so we assumed that this hotel would be of the same high standard. Sadly this was not the case.When we checked in it was chaotic to say the least, the pre printed details on their sheet were incorrect and they didn't seem to know what they were doing. We requested a non smoking room which they gave us, but the room left a great deal to be desired. The first thing that struck us was the musty/damp smell and the second thing was the bathroom which was tiny and tired looking with wonky light fittings etc. We resorted to spraying perfume in the air to try and alleviate the smell! Our room overlooked the road - not recommended. I queried with reception whether the room was a premier room and was assured that it was - I was not impressedWe ate in one of the restaurants - the service was at best chaotic and at worst inadequate, although to be fair the food was good.Our train left early in the morning and we were told that we could order a picnic lunch which we did via room service. When we collected it the following morning we were told that the food we had requested was not available and that we had been given a sandwich, muffin, drink and crips in lieu of breakfast........... very strange.All in all a very disappointing stay - thankfully for only one night. Had we been staying longer we would have moved to another hotel. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Hmmmm It may have been because the President of the Phillipinnes was staying at the hotel but i did experience problems; safe didnt work, lights kept being switched on and off and no explanation until i complained (electrician repairing fault by messing around with fusebox) emergency exit opened mistakenly, setting alarm off which resulted in security men shouting outside my room, aIrline rang hotel to confirm flight; left messages on voicemail and with reception, neither me or my colleagues got a single message!!!And finally, my room overlooked pool but the Filippino entourage hung out there to smoke late at night and crack of dawn talking very very loudly!On the positive;large bedroom, extemely comfortable bed, quiet effective air con. Excellent food and cocktails in 360 restaurant bar. Good value and high standard hotel car.(Better than rip off ITC Sheraton)Lobby area soulless, wouldnt recommend for single traveller "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great location nice hotel Had opportunity to stay at this very nice hotel on 3 seperate occasions in the space of 2 weeks and always found it to be a real haven in the bustle of Delhi. Location is great but get a room on the golf course side to avoid road noise (car horns). Rooms lovely, cool and well appointed. We were holidaying and not there on business and made good use of the pool, cafe, restaurants - especially Threesixty which has great contemporary food and ambience, and the designer shops. The staff were very helpful with all our arrangements. The location is great, close to Khan Market which is a great shopping area. Hotel organised a taxi for us so we didn't need to use hotel car and three hours cost around 300Rs! Nice to have the taxi waiting for you and willing to take you anywhere. Really liked this hotel and would definately stay here again. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Competent business hotel This hotel has none of the boutique feel of the Oberoi chain's other properties, and is very much a business hotel, with a lobby that is permanently full of suited Australians to drive home the point. However, as business hotels go, this is one of the better ones I have stayed in. The rooms themselves are indistinguishable from those of any other large corporate hotel, but they are clean, adequately proportioned and supplied with all the usual ameneties. Views are either of the golf course or of a busy road with Humayun's tomb in the (far) distance, and are nothing to write home about. The restaurants are all very good, and the pool is generally neat and clean, and large enough to easily absorb a large number of guests and still leave room for a proper swim.The hotel's really standout quality, however, is its staff, who suffer from none of the aloof surliness that I have come to associate with this class of hotel. A more charming and helpful group of people it would be hard to find, which is all the more surprising given the hotel's policy of actively discouraging tipping. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good Oberoi Oberoi is one of the best properties in Delhi and which is why we decided to stay there this time. In the past, we have stayed at newer properties likes Hilton, Le-Meridien and Shangri-La.Oberoi is a happening place compared to some of the other comparable hotels. Despite its poor entrace approach, it is a bustling place. Service is good but more business like - you are served well but it lacks the warmth of eastern hospitality. Restaurants are good but not exceptional as you would expect at a place like this. Coffe shop is extremely over-rated - quality is average but the service is poor - they don't even have decent coffee cups to cary your drinks. Chines restaurant, Taipen, is good.ah - also watch out of breakfast charges that show-up on your bill when you checkout even when the breakfast was complimentry. "
oberoi new delhi ,"You must stay here ! I have very high standards and am easily disappointed by most so called 5 star hotels . This I happily have to say is the exception , you won't find one flaw in Oberoi's product , from the bloke at the door to the lady who takes your room service order excellent five star service . The views are wonderful over Delhi's parkland , the pool area is spacious and clean and staff are always on hand to ensure you enjoy your stay . Although in a modern building there is no getting away from the fact you are in the capital city of India , tasteful decoration and aterfacts from around the country add to the ambience of the hotel .We tried three of the four restaurants and the choice and food quality is excellent .I highly recommend staying here on you Business or Pleasure visits to Delhi . "
oberoi new delhi ,Can't recommend it enough We arrived here after traveling from NZ via KL before starting our journey on the Palace on Wheels tour (different review). Staff in the Oberoi were attentive and went the extra mile. And no tipping allowed! The buffet breakfast was fantastic. We also ate here on the evening and I ate a la carte and my husband had a buffet. Both were excellent.It was our 25th wedding anniversary and they had put huge bouquets of flowers and a cake in our room. It was a lovely surprise. We always stay in 5 star hotels and this is an excellent hotel. Definitely 5 star plus. 
oberoi new delhi ,"A Classy Hotel but quite pricey The Oberoi Hotel in New Delhi is located in a very pleasant and quite area of the city. Have stayed here a few times and this time I found the hotel somewhat expensive, especially for food (Chinese restaurant on top is very overpriced for very average food). The bar was also expensive even by European standards(USD 10 equiv for a pint of draft local beer). The fitness center and outdoor pool are excellent - among the best. Rooms are nicely furnished and very comfortable. And the staff service is exceptional. "
oberoi new delhi ,The Best! I've stayed at the Oberoi several times for business visits to Delhi; it is one my my 3 favorite hotels in the world. I can't say enough good things: the service is truly outstanding; the restaurants are wonderful (especially love the breakfast); the gym is state of the art; a good large pool. it's an oasis of peace and quiet amid a sometimes exhausting city. Get a room overlooking the golf course if possible. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Nicest taxi-drivers are at the Oberoi! We had a wonderful experience one evening when I took two young kids to the large Sikh temple in Delhi - our taxi driver from the Oberoi happened to be a Sikh and he personally gave us a tour of the temple. He was clearly very proud of the temple (rightfully so - it's beautiful!) and showed us where to check our shoes, helped the kids with their headscarves (there's a basket of these for visitors), got us going in the right direction, explained the significance of the sacred books and walked us around the stunning, enormous pool which was surrounded by a marble pillored courtyard. The kids loved it and our experience was made so much richer because of the kindness of our driver.Okay, back to the review of the hotel!Our room (252) was very nice, albeit not huge. Service was sparkling. The business center and gym state-of-the-art. I could've sat in the threesixty bar and just people-watched all day! All manner of interesting and beautiful people seemed to meet at the Oberoi for breakfast/lunch/dinner/drinks/functions. The only drawback of this hotel is that you can't walk anywhere from it. It's an island surrounded by busy roads. But the taxis are cheap and plentiful. We also rented a car and driver for an afternoon (booked through the concierge) and that made shopping/sightseeing very convenient!Did someone say shopping? The Oberoi is near the Khan market which has several fun shops (Anokhi, FabIndia, Good Earth) as well as pharmacy, English bookstore and toy shop (found a great Indian Barbie here - complete with sari and bhindi - she made a nice gift for a friend's little girl in America!)One tip - if you arrive at the Delhi domestic airport and are not on your own, have one person get the luggage while you get the taxi ticket from the taxi kiosk inside the baggage hall. This will save you having to wait in a long line. A non a/c taxi to the Oberoi cost us 200 rupees. "
oberoi new delhi ,"World class hotel This is a truly good hotel, a real five star from the rooms, to the food, to the service. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed on arrival to discover that the hustle and bustle of central Delhi's street life was not on my doorstep. However, after experiencing the full-on bedlam of the tourist haunts it was a delight to be able to retreat to the relative tranquility and superb air conditioning of the Oberoi and slip into its cool pool. The downside is there is nowhere to walk to in the evening but the hotel has a taxi rank of trusted drivers who use meters and will whisk you to the bright lights for around 100 rupees plus tip or you can often find an auto rickshaw outside the gates, the price of which you should negotiate ruthlessly before getting in. As a guide, I negotiated 50 rupees and dropped a decent tip. I asked the hotel to arrange a car to pick me up from the airport and was glad I did. At midnight it was bedlam but the hotel's friendly and serene airport representative greeted me from the flight, showed me to the car and I was on my way within minutes. Having arrived tired and minus baggage it was worth every penny not to have to run the gammut of touts and negotiations. Hotel check in was warm and efficient, the room beautifully decorated and equipped, including tea/coffee making facilities, a hair dryer and a powerful hot shower and that was just the deluxe room. Surprisingly, no iron/board but there is a one hour pressing service that won't break the bank. Staff were not only courteous and efficient but were genuinely friendly, often stopping to chat and enquire how I was. Great restaurants in the hotel, too and plenty of them, including Chinese, Indian and Italian, with the 360d restaurant offering a more varied menu. The breakfast buffet was very good. As well as the pastries, cereals and fresh fruits there is also a full cooked breakfast buffet. The 360d also offers an excellent lunchtime buffet that covers everything from Japanese Sushi, to Meditteranean, to a variety of regional Indian dishes which were particularly yummy and a great way to try out new foods from the host country. Some of the dishes on its evening menu were truly inspired but there is also plenty of choice if you want something simple. The bar and restaurants appear to be a favoured hangout of Delhi's wealthier classes and watching the social interactions is fascinating for the people watchers among us. Would I choose the Oberoi again? Without hesitation. "
oberoi new delhi ,bad location Overall: good hotel but awful locationRoom: We arrived late and went to bed quickly - but no way to find sleep... our room was facing the highway with much traffic (as half of the hotel rooms) ... after a night without sleep we claimed and were moved to a room facing the garden/golf court for the 2nd night which was wonderfully quiet. The room itself was well kept and nicely decorated as you would expect from a 5* The lady at the reception was very professional. The restaurant is in the cellar () but food and service was excellent. The Spa is ok but nothing special (I had an average massage) Generally the hotel is a bit far away of the interesting parts of Delhi and I would suggest to spend a bit more and go to the Imoperial. 
oberoi new delhi ,"A very good experience: I recommend The Oberoi is expensive, even for Delhi, but it is classy and the staff are very very nice.The pool is just great-beautifully clean, cool water-I dove in after a great steam in the men's locker room.The health club is a bit small, but great equipment, all clean and latest issue.The food at the 360 restaurant is expensive, but very tasty.It is peaceful at The Oberoi.We enjoyed it. "
oberoi new delhi ,great hotel We stayed at the Oberoi in March with 2007 with our 4 and 2 year olds and found the hotel excellent and the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. A special mention goes to the Concierge Parikshit who admirably organised a number of our travel arrangements beforehand through email correspondence.Throughout the hotel everything was clean and well maintained. The room we had was no exception and had a great view over the city including Humayans Tomb.Western and Indian food was well prepared and very tasty. There was also plenty to feed the children.The airport transfers were efficiently arranged and the cars modern and clean. The only gripe we had was the car transfers the hotel arranged for us to and from the railway station which involved quite a few frought moments.This is a Western style business hotel so dont stay here if you want the 'real India' but all in all a super hotel which we will stay at again. 
oberoi new delhi ,"Pretty Good! I typically like staying in the Oberoi chain. This one was no exception. The rooms were well-appointed, albeit old. Wifi was good and strong. Bathrooms were well maintained. The best part of the hotel is the fitness area - the pool is beautiful, spa is great, fitness centre very well equipped and a nice 20m indoor pool. My only grouse is that Oberoi hotels should start putting LCD TVs in their rooms. "
oberoi new delhi ,Superb hotel. The Oberoi pays attention to detail. Everything is done extremely well. Service is superlative. The restaurants are excellent. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The staff is unbelievably well trained. The business center is run flawlessly. The gym and spa are fantastic. I could go on and on about this hotel. 
oberoi new delhi ,"A Very Pleasant Experience I was expecting a great stay at this hotel because of it's reputation and we were not disappointed.The service we received was outstanding. Highlights for me were the Italian restaurant, a superb meal as good as the best in Italy, the buffet breakfast and the pastry shop.A choice of pillows with different fillings and bulk was a nice touch. The travel shop downstairs was very helpful and friendly and sorted out my onward travel in India. The hotel is in a good location for the sights.The only downside for me was that there was some noise from the road which was a little intrusive. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great Hotel Awesome service We stayed at The Oberoi over christmas specially to check out the Spa, which is run by Banyan tree. The experience was simply amazing. Buffet Lunch at Threesixty restaurant was value for money and service was good. Must visit the Chinese resaturant on the rooftop - good ambience and a great view on the city. Our room was overlooking the golf course and very comfortable. "
oberoi new delhi ,"the hotel of my dreams this is the hotel of my dreams...perfect in every way...I would come back here just to be pampered, use the spa, and feel like I am a Maharaja. Has the best Chinese restaurant I have ever been in. Great service throughout the hotel "
oberoi new delhi ,"OK but not 5 star service. Just returned from a trip to India. Stayed at the Oberoi for 2 nights. Over all a pretty good hotel, but certaily not 5 stars. Service was lacking. When I arrived to check-in around 11pm was informed that my room on the 7th floor was ready. Since my brother was also staying there- on the 4th floor, I asked if it was possible to get a room on his floor. I was informed that there were no rooms available on his floor and that I could get a room on the 3rd floor. I declined this offer. I was handed the key-card and made my way up to the 7th floor, only to discover that I had been given &quot;keys&quot; to a room on the 3rd floor. When I went back to the front desk, the staff, including duty manager Sharda, insisted that there never was a room on the 7th floor for me (even though the receptionist had earlier, taken out a folder with my name and 7th floor room number on it)! Well, that was there story and they stuck to it! The lack of honesty was quite dissappointing! Otherwise, great location, decent rooms (somewhat worn), and average service. Would try the Shangri-La next time. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Loved the Oberoi!!! Excellent hotel and great location in Delhi. Impeccable service -- the best I have ever experienced AND the staff is not waiting around for a tip (gratuities are given at the end of the stay). Excellent Indian cuisine and superb breakfast buffet. The spa facilities were outstanding (practically new -- four months old), but the massages were lacking. The rooms were nice but needed updating. Expensive but worth the splurge especially for a foreigner on a first trip to Delhi. All the Western amenities are offered. Louis Vuitton and other chic boutiques are located in the hotel. I highly, highly recommend the Oberoi, New Delhi. I look forward to staying at an Oberoi on my next trip to India. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Oberoi New Dilhi New Delhi: The Oberoi New DelhiNovember 2006Tripadvisor member from UKThis Hotel was outstanding.The Service above expectations and the food delicious. Definately try the Italian restaurant at the hotel.Rooms were immaculate especially the Suites which were the best I have stayed in for a very long time.Staff very friendly. This hotel, in my opinion is better than Maurya Sheriton which is supposed to be the best in the city.Expect to pay a lot more than other 5* hotels. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Okay hotel... One of main reason that I stayed in this hotel is for business because it's close to our off shore office in New Delhi. This is the second time I've stayed in this hotel and it has gotten slightly better since they have added a new spa and gym.Checking in takes a little bit of time. The room are dated and needs renovation and bathroom needs a REALLY good scrubing! I wished they had update the rooms instead of adding the new spa and gym (even though I've used the spa and the gym which is TOTALLY different experience than the room and if they had updated the rooms to that of the spa, I would've gave an excellent rating). Breakfast is good but takes time to get what was ordered and staff seems a little lost half the time and seems like they need training considering this is a 5 star hotel!Only if they could just upgrade to the current 5 star standard in ALL areas.... "
oberoi new delhi ,"Perfect hotel-stay here! My husband and I stayed at the Oberoi for 2 nights. The Oberoi is a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable, with the Oberoi staff going out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are beautiful and the pool alone is worth the stay. The spa is the ultimate in luxury (I had the Oberoi massage). Also, we ate twice at the 360 restaurant and the food is fabulous. Room service is the same price as eating in the restaurant, which is nice for a change.We started our holiday at the Claridges Hotel and then switched to the Oberoi and we wish we'd just paid a bit more and stayed only at the Oberoi. There is no comparison between the two and it is well worth the money. "
oberoi new delhi ,"The best in New Delhi by far. The Oberoi New Delhi was a heaven of peace and tranquility far from busy and polluted roads of the city. New Delhi was the first stop in my tour celebrating our first wedding anniversary. We arrived late at night on arrival we were welcomed by the Oberoi people in the airport and were transferred to the hotel. Just filled a from and were shown to our room.It was modern, cozy and was nicely furnished. The bathroom has a bathtub and good water pressure. Our room faced the gold course, nice view.The staff were nice and welcoming. My wife tried the SPA which was run by Banyan Tree, she was thrilled, and not to mention it was fairly cheap, about US$ 50 per one hour session.In the time I was there the Oberoi was expanding their SPA and there was some building work going on, this did not disturb us at all.I was really amazed on how the staff took every gust personally asking them about there preferences and their experience in the city.A very fine hotel indeed, long live the Oberoi! "
oberoi new delhi ,"Enjoyed our stay at the Oberoi New Delhi The service at at the Oberoi was excellent, starting from being greeted by a hotel rep at the airport and then driven to the hotel in one of their fleet of cars. Their reception staff, bellboys, concierge and drivers were all courteous and helpful.The food was excellent at both their Indian and Chinese restaurants. At the 360 restaurant, the breakfast buffet was very nice and by night, its a happening place to be, with the young, affluent people of New Delhi having drinks, sushi and pizzas from their wood-fired oven.On our return to New Delhi, after 10 days in India, the Oberoi staff met us right in front of our train car window, on the platform, to take us to the hotel. The new spa and gym had just opened up; the spa was gorgeous and the gym was very well equipped.We thought it was a great hotel for us, just pleasure travellers, but it also seemed like a busy business hotel. We'd definitely stay there again. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Not as good as we hoped. We stayed here in Feb 2006. On arrival at 3 am we were told that they didnt have the 2 rooms we had booked as they were full. We( 2 adults and our 15 and 12 year old kids) had to share a room with (uncomfortable) put- you- up beds for the kids. Not the best start! We ate at the 360 degree restaurant for the buffet lunch the next day- the food was really fabulous but it was HUGELY expensive- it was the most expensive meal we had in our trip, and that I have ever had while in India. We ate at night in the hotel's Indian restaurant ( which was complimentary because of the fact we had had to share a room the previous night). The food there was disappointing. The bedrooms were clean and well decorated as were the bathrooms. A problem with the kids toilet was quickly fixed. The staff were all very helpful. The lobby area is attractive. The shops are top end, and expensive.Overall it was fine- but I will not stay there again. We stayed at The Claridges on a previous trip, and even although its not as upmarket as The Oberoi, I found it more relaxed, better value for money, and would stay there in preference. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good but not the best I recently stayed in the Oberoi for two nights and had overall an enjoyable and pleasant stay.My room was on the 16th floor with very nice views over the Marine Drive and the sea. The room was of average room size, was very clean, tidy and comfortable. The furniture seemed outdated and a bit old fashioned. The same applies to the bathroom.Staff at the hotel, including the very efficient and friendly buttler were polite, helpful and accommodating. I was dissapointed by the small and unimanigative pool area, squeezed between the Oberoi and it's sister hotel, the Hilton Towers. The Hilton pool at least is larger and the area does not feel so squashed.There is a variety of restaurants and bars in the Oberoi. It is also possible to use all outlets of the Hilton next door.I tried some of the outlest and was highly impressed with the Champagne lunch at the Italian fine dining restaurant at the Oberoi. Starters and deserts are chosen from a buffet, whilst soup, pasta and main course are chosen from a large menu.The food was outstanding and I enjoyed every single course. Champagne, Wine and Vodka as well as certain soft drinks are included. The price tag for the lunch is rather hefty (INR 3000 - roughly USD 65) but the meal combined with the super effiecient and friendly service as well as the live jazz music make this a well worth it treat.I also tried the Tepanyaki dinner at India Jones and enjoyed this a lot as well.Overall the Oberoi is a pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in New Delhi. However, compared to some of the Super Deluxe properties like the Rajvillas in Jaipur, this hotel does not live up to what I would have imagined. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Could have been better Belonging to the generally hyped Oberoi chain, we had greater expectations from this hotel but was disappointed with the result. The service quality was mediocre, with the staff rude and unhelpful. We informed the front desk about our morning departure at 10.00 am the night before and were disturbed three times starting from 08.00 am, twice by the minibar staff and once by the housekeeping to let us out. The rooms were small, amenities standard and the comfort level average. Nevertheless, compared to other New Delhi hotels, Oberoi seems a better choice despite the negative factors. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Very Nice Hotel I recently spent 3 nights at the Oberio in New Delhi. From airport pickup to checkout, it was an extremely pleasant experience. The rooms were very nice with comfortable beds and extremely clean (not like the Imperial). The concierge desk was very helpful arranging tours with a hotel car which were new Toyota cars with leather seating and great A/C. Having stayed at the Imperial and Taj Palace on this trip I can say that the Oberio's rooms were far superior to the others. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good but not great The Oberoi hotel is nice, but for the rates they charge, I have to wonder if it is worth it. My room was nicely decorated, but small. The bathroom tub was not working properly and when I called to get it fixed it took at least one hour before someone came to fix it. Also, they did not fix it properly. 360 restaurant is a pleasant retreat from the rest of the hotel. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. I had a massage at the spa and it was nice, but the showers and common area were not as clean as I would have preferred. I told the front staff and they sent someone to clean the locker room area, but still I did not feel comfortable using the showers. Overall, the hotel is elegant in its own way, but the staff seemed to want to charge you for any assistance they provide. This is a good hotel to stay in if you are familiar with New Delhi and are not looking for geographical convenience. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Business Hotel In the price range and star rating, hotel stay was just above average. Room size was rather small compared to other hotels I've stayed in SE Asia. Pool wasn't very attractive and needs to be updated. No gift shop but &quot;high-end&quot; stores for shopping. Limo from airport to hotel was $55US. Taxi would be 10% of that. On the positive side: Butler sevice was very attentive. Food was very good. Buffet breakfast was 800 rupees. Coffee an extra 225 Rs. Lunch was 1500 Rs. Not recommended for families or tourist as its rather out of the way (although a short cab ride) from the city center. Stayed in other Obeori's in India with better sized rooms. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Very nice hotel The executive floor (7th?) was very nice with a butler and an adequately sized room. The front desk and service are all very good although the butler was unable to solve the wi-fi connectivity problem and attributed it to a &quot;firewall&quot; in my laptop. The gym is nice but has old treadmills - only two - but very attentive staff.food in the lobby restaurant was very good but the staff misled me with regard to availability of non-smoking tables - they have only three stuck in a corner. When I came in to eat they ushered me to a regular area saying that there would not be smoke only to find within a half-hour that there was a pall heading my way,Concierge is very good and they arranged a car at short notice - exceptionally good driver. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Great comfort and peace in a chaotic city It was my first time to India and I was lucky to have been lodged at the Oberoi by my employer. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which helped counter the jet lag. The restaurants were very good, and one of them was trendy and a pleasure to have breakfast in.The hotel's gym has two treadmills, two stationary bycicles, one rowing machine, and two elliptical training machines, as well as Nautilus machines and dumbbells. There is a small spa as well as a nice swimming pool.There is also a small bookstore where you can get gifts to bring back home if you don't have time to shop. There is also a Louis Vuitton shop.The hotel is not located in the center of things. In that sense, I would rather have stayed at the Imperial Hotel or Le Meridien where I could have walked to Connaught Place in the evening after business meetings were over.The only sour note comes from the checkout. The computers were down, and when I reviewed the faxed bill, they had overcharged me by $10 for things I did not take from the minibar on the last night of my stay.Other than that, it is highly recommendable for business travelers, but a bit boring if you are a tourist. "
oberoi new delhi ,"Good Business Hotel Spent 6 nights for business in Executive Suite at rate of $350 USD per night. As a point of reference, I travel world wide frequenlty and typically select higher end hotels. This was my 4th visit to India so I am very familiar with typical business accomodations, culture and potential language barriers.2 room suite consisted of living area with table for 4, wet/mini bar, sofa, chair, coffee table, cabinet with 27&quot; tv and dvd player and a desk with fax machine. Bedroom area was king size bed (very comfortable), another 27&quot; TV, dresser and dual closets. Bath was standard with single sink, tub/shower combination and commode. By business suite standards I would say that the room was cramped with too much furniture and decoration to be functional. The bathroom was also very small and would have been a challenge for 2 people to share. View from the room was over looking pool and partial golf course. Overall space was average for a suite and bathrooms in particular should be larger.Service at this hotel for the most part is top notch. Suite comes with very accomodating butler service 24 hours per day. Front desk, concierge, cashier and business center were all very helpful with any inquiries or needs. I had 2 experiences with the hotel lounges and both were average. 1st night, we ordered a bottle of wine and wanted menus for food - had to ask three times to get the menus and waited about 15 minutes when requesting the bill. Also went to the piano lounge one night about 30 minutes before closing and felt as though the bartender wanted to go home instead of serving drinks. Our drinks were served with a clear &quot;last call&quot; message.The spa at the Oberoi was outstanding. I had 4 massages over the course of my stay and every therapist was very professional and went out of their way to make you comfortable. The facilitites themselves were nice but the main attraction is the treatments themselves. Great value and service provided. Workout facilities were also very nice.Pool area was beautiful and very well kept. Security is more than adequate with guards on each floor at night as well as throughout the hotel and grounds. Overall, I was statisfied with my stay and would reccomend the hotel for business travelers. I only saw the standard room from the hallway but it looked to be satisfactory as well. I am not able to comment on the location for tourism as I visit 2-3 times per year and only work during my visits. Hotel is about 40 mintes from the airport and in an affluent part of Delhi.I would stay at the Oberoi again but if the room itself is important, you may want to consider the The Grand. Although in the same price range for a business suite, the room is far superior. Service, location and facilities however, are not as good as the Oberoi. "

pablas international hotel ,Poor run down A very rundown hotelOnly basic amenitiesRestaurant was very basic as wellCleanliness - passable 
pablas international hotel ,"Avoid Pablas at all costs! We arrived at Pablas International around 10pm, dragged all of our luggage into the lobby, and someone named Arif greeted us and asked how our trip was. The hotel lobby was nice and we were happy to finally be there and get checked into our rooms. Then Arif broke the news that he didn't have any rooms for us at Pablas. He said that he had &quot;better&quot; rooms at a hotel down the street called &quot;Ranouk&quot; (I can't get remember the exact name, but it was something like that). I asked why he had us unload our bags from the car if he didn't have rooms for us - how annoying. It became clear that Arif was giving us the run around - he just wanted us to come to the hotel and make sure he didn't lose any commissions. It was late and we didn't have too many options other than to stay down the street - so we loaded our luggage back into the car and went to the other hotel - and boy was it a dive! We found a different hotel the next day. We got a refund from hotels.com and Pablas didn't dispute it. I ran into another unhappy traveler at the &quot;hotel down the street&quot; and he said the same thing happened to him. It looks like a nice enough hotel, but what difference does it make if they don't have a room for you when you make a reservation? "
pablas international hotel ,Passable Pablas This place was ok - the rooms were big but not necessarily clean - nicer than a hostel though. The staff were mostly helpful but quite rude if you weren't to take them up on their 'city taxi tour offers'. The buffet breakfast was ok but sometimes cold and not necessarily value for money. I was moved to a different room each night of my stay - so perhaps best just for one night stopovers! 
pablas international hotel ,Occupied despite credit card guaranteed reservation We had made a reservation trough an internet booking agency (hotel.de) guaranteed by credit card. All rooms were occupied at check-in time. The obvious reason wasthat all individual reservations were cancelled to accomodate agroup of 20 people that arrived shortly later. 
pablas international hotel ,"Hot water please! I returned from New Delhi, India on December 19, 2007 and I just wanted to give my overview of my 10 day stay in Hotel Pablas International. On the positive side, the staff there were very accomodating and friendly. The hotel itself had the basic amenities that you would expect in the US. There was Internet access, cable stations and shopping geared towards tourists. However, I thought that I would describe some of the differences that made our stay less than favorable. For one thing, we had to request new linen and that our room be cleaned. None of the staff really explained to us how room service worked. And after 3 days the room was in desperate need of attention. Another issue was the roach infestation on my first night at the hotel. When I couldn't tell whether or not we were in the roachs' room or he was in ours, I assassinated the creature and contacted the front desk. Soon thereafter, a staff person came to the room and simply threw the remains in the trash, nodded to me and left. I was too exhausted to debate the issue. Then, a couple of days later I saw another insect. And, I guess that other guests complained to the point that the hotel management decided to spray all of the rooms with a pesticide. This would have normally been good news except that none of the guests were warned about the indoor crop dusting and we nearly suffocated. Another thing to be cautious of is to know how much US money you are actually tipping taxi drivers or hotel staff. Unsavy foreigners can be tricked and duped if you don't negotiate carefully. Another good rule of thumb is not to give the women and children that surround the hotel any money or food unless you are prepared to be swarmed. You will quickly learn how to say nay nay. I was also unprepared for the surcharge for using the Internet. The last inconveince was to not know how long it would take to get hot water. This was my second trip to India, therefore, I was prepared to wait for hot water. But, we had so many problems with our hot water that we had to use the shower in another room. Last but not least, this hotel listed that it had a doctor on staff but after I woke up one morning with a golfball sized bump on my calf, I asked someone at the front desk about a doctor, I was told to try going to a drugstore and to get an ointment. Overall, this hotel was not that bad but there are some issues that can be understood and some that definitely need addressing. If someone asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be not really. "
pablas international hotel ,"Reasonably priced accomodation in New Delhi At the beginning of a GAP Tour of Northern India, we stayed at Hotel Pablas International in Karol Bagh in New Delhi.The hotel's rooms are sparse and ours had no window. However, the room and bathroom were clean.The room was better than we expected and had a colour television with satellite and an air conditioner and fan.The fourth floor had a very good restaurant with very reasonably priced dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Each day's charge includes breakfast.Located in one of the busiest markets in New Delhi, you can find anything you want by wandering around. But, the area is not the safest, so watch out for pick pockets.Overall, the hotel was reasonable. "
pablas international hotel ,"Avoid this hotel Luckily we only stayed for 1 night at this hotel. We paid £19 for the room but it was not worth the money. I lifted my pillow when getting into bed and discovered a cockroach underneath it! I then saw another scurrying across the floor! We moved rooms to one with only twin beds. There was no outside window which made the room very dark in the morning. There was only one dirty towel for me and my boyfriend to use. The bed linen had stains on it and holes in it and the shower could only be described as a dribble. There are lots of other hotels in the Karol Bagh area so look around, don't stay at the Pablas International! "
pablas international hotel ,"Cheats and abusive people who should not be in business I had a very bad experience at Pablas International Hotel, Karol Baugh, Delhi. I was travelling to Delhi from Bangalore. And I booked this hotel from [-].in site by the credit card.I was charged $6/- for booking. 1) First of all, the booking had advertised that the hotel provides free pickup from the airport. The advertised pickup from airport is not there. After calling the hotel a number of times, they told me that I should take a prepaid taxi from the airport and they will refund me the prepaid taxi fare. I really dont know why the [-] in gives false information.2) When I landed at the hotel (and remember the rates at the hotel are close to Rs. 2000/- (around $40/- per night), II was taken to another hotel as this hotel seems to have been booked. I dont understand how the [-] and the hotel confirmed booking for me at the hotel, if there was no room. Some excuse was given that one client at the hotel who was supposed to leave fell sick.3) Finally the worst thing. They won't give you a proper receipt for the money paid. All they did was give a handwritten signature receipt. This is probably a con -- they are trying to save taxes4) At night 10 pm, one guy comes to ask for money for room stay. I refused to give him the money in the absence of receipt. Next day his boss comes to me and says that I abused the guy the earlier night. Further, the boss abuses me left, right and center.Further, the guy lectures me on how he has experience in worldwide hotel business. I travel widely and visit US every year, and there is no where in the world, they dont give receipts. He started saying that the &quot;money due' printout that I got via the web reservationitself is the receipt blah blah blah. The next day morning itself I changed my hotel.I dont know why these people are still in business when they treat customers this way.I suggest everyone avoid this hotel at all costs. regards,Dr. Samir KelekarBangaloreIndia.samir_kelekar@yahoo.com91-98450-44403 "
pablas international hotel ,"Good hotel After booking on Expedia then seeing the other review, I wasn't looking forward to staying at this hotel. However, there was certainly nothing wrong with the room we got or the service we received.The deluxe room was just that....large, good bed, clean, working air con, satellite tv and running h&amp;c water.There were no cockroaches or bedbugs to be seen and the room was gleaming. They stored my bag (at no charge) while I toured India for a couple of weeks and arranged a taxi to the airport after I asked them to. There was no pressure to buy anything through them and the taxi came at the time I had asked for.It's not the Ritz, but it was a perfectly adequate hotel for the money. It's a 5 minute walk through busy Karol Bagh to the metro station and there are a million autorickshaws available to transport you to the sites.I'd stay here again without complaint. "
pablas international hotel ,"Avoid at all costs It is a cheap hotel but there are so many cheap hotels in New Delhi it is easilly avoided. We paid for a deluxe city room and got a view of a wall but much worse than that, there were cockroaches everywhere, and i mean everywhere!!!! they lived under the bed and after moving rooms three times gave up in the end and counted the seconds until we could leave the place. Also, our flight was 4 in the morning so we had to pay an extra nights stay, we didn't want to leave until 1pm but at 12 middnight the men came to get our bags and they kept ringing and knocking the doors for us to get out. we then had to wait downstairs for an hour with another couple who had also paid to stay in the same bedroom that night while the cleaners quickly gave it the once over!!!! unbelievable. They also work extremely closely with a tour operator and it is just about impssible to have any peace unless you agree to pay them money for taxis and tours.AVOID!!!!!! "

pamposh guest house ,"This is not a very good hotel with a location to match... We previously stayed at the owners other guest house in Gurgaon, a suburb on the outskirts of Delhi for a friends wedding, but then we moved to this hotel to be nearer Delhi city centre.Good - The room was clean and a decent size, with a good size bathroom and also had air conditioning. - The owner Bobby was extremely helpful in answering any questions that we had.Bad - Although the hotel is clean it was very dark and dingy. - The staff do not understand and cannot speak much English making communication very difficult and time consuming. - The location of the hotel is too far away from the Delhi centre and the main sights. - There is nothing near the hotel in terms of night life; restaurants, bars etc. - We asked them to book a bus for us to Agra (as the train was fully booked) and they booked us onto a day-trip tour of Agra full of locals!OverallThis is not a very good hotel with a location to match.

pamposh guest house ,People You Can Trust We stayed for 12 nights in Oktober 2008 Everything we wanted was perfectley done We can recommend this guesthouse Good vallue for your money We just wanted a clean and safe place to sleep and that is exectley what Pamposh offers.ThanksHenk and Sytske NijlandHolland 
pamposh guest house ,"Great Location and Comfortable Stay This is my second visit to Delhi and found this Guest House from their website. This is located in great, nice location. Surroundings have a nice green park, Dominoz Pizza, Subway and Ruby Tuesday Restaurants. Rooms are nice and fully western style with great service. Nice for family stay and teenagers. This is located in the shopping center, so no worries to travel for shopping. "
pamposh guest house ,"Bad experience at this hotel We came to the hotel with the intention of staying 2 nights but only stayed one night as we were very disappointed with its facilities and couldn't bare to stay longer. First of all, the hotel outside didn't even look like the picture I saw on its website. It had a small board with &quot;Pamposh&quot; written on it with a single door leading to narrow stairs up to the hotel reception area. We booked two double rooms. One of the rooms was on the top floor. That means we had to walk out through the balcony that had no roof in order to get to the room. As I was walking up the stairs (only had minimum lighting) to the top floor, I hit my head so hard as the concrete ceiling above the stairs was too low for someone of average height.Each room had a portable heater that was not enough to keep the room warm enough for the cold weather at the time we visited Delhi. Hot water was not available to our satisfaction as we would only get a bucket of hot water and then it would stop. You would then get only cold water. You have to wait a long time for the water to heat up before you get more hot water (they have a switch in the washroom that you need to turn on to heat up the water). The colour of the water was brown for the first 10 seconds after I opened tap in the shower. We complained about not getting enough hot water. One of the staff came to investigate, pretended like he was trying to fix it, left the room and never returned. It was late and we were tired after a long flight, so we just went to sleep with the strong intention of checking out next morning as early as possible. It was our first visit to Delhi and booking this hotel was a big mistake and booking it on the first night of our vacation was even a bigger mistake. If you are traveling with family/kids especially, don't stay at Pamposh. If you want a reasonable hotel in Delhi, don't book anything too cheap. If the price for the room seems relatively too low for Delhi, then don't go for it. "
pamposh guest house ,"nice location new rooms Hey i read the reviews in this website and wanted to take a chance to explore this place. Thx to Dimmy83 for updating the information of new rooms. Yes this place has new rooms with nice decoration, and i think its under new management and thats the reason all bathroom are new. I was lucky to get Super Dlx Room for Dlx Room price. stayed there for 3 nights, loved the location and my favourite Subway and TGI Fridays near by.Hope they continue with this maintainence and renovation.Thx Trip Advisor "
pamposh guest house ,"Clean and looking forward for better after renovation I got the information thru their website, it looked nice and clean.Paid advance amount to book the room and was sent confirmation ticket with 5% discount they offer for all customers online booking. Was picked up from an airport and came night 11pm. First encounter was street dogs barking, not near hotel but about 500 meters away from hotel, that made me little upset and scary. But things were better when reached the guest house. Guy helped to get my luggage, even though he did not understand english, but managed to understand whatever i said...SURPRISED ME...!!!!! I went to front desk and showed my confirmation ticket and was escorted to top floor room. Nice room looked newely rennovated and i was right...it was rennovated few weeks before. Bathrooms was absolutely clean with nice beige tiles and with nice band of decorative tiles to show elegent. Towels were new and liked their bathroom sleepers for walking around the room coz i forgot to get one along.In the morning, I was introduced to Mr. Vishal, Manager who was very nice and curtious and helped me to plan my day to go around Delhi. He gave me few tips to deal with auto rickshaws, shopkeepers for price bargaining...IT REALLY WORKED. Guest house is located in around nice restaurants like SUBWAY, DOMINOZ PIZZA. Across was a taxi stand and car mechanics working on denting, painting on cars. Well it did not borther me as its common in Delhi. First i was scared to find good place as told by my friend in USA. Power outage was a bit concerned since with the power backup A/C does not work only fans works...but was not long with power outage. Really liked the FREE WIFI Access.Planning to visit next year to see the newely renovated rooms. "
pamposh guest house ,"Basic to the Floor rich and poor rub shoulders I chose it from seeing their website and it was booked by our agent. It was a little bit too cheap.The Pamposh is-just as you see it, you get it: bedsheet spots- this would not be star rated at all in the UK, unfinished edges-Nice location in an allround way, the squalor is the one side; and right next to the poverty rubbing shoulders with the 'posh' part, is a good resid area, where there are a couple of modern yoga studios where people well off enough to employ the others as servants can go. The nearby taxi station lies beneath a tarpaulin tent roof, in the squalid market road corner with food vendors cooking up something vry unappealing. On the ground level of the guest house is a Dominoes pizza, that's okay, you can so easily walk it up to your own room.There is also a Paratha restaurant which is highly recommended in South Delhi, but not vegetarian - it smelt terriblt to me, like the outdoors squallor quite inescapeable for Delhi newbies. This is a S.Delhi heartland with modern shops nearby;the 24 hour ATM by the entrance is actually only a local bank card taker- so I was told; there is a delicatessen like 24-7 supermarket, where I saw organic soya milk, and many better quality Western brands, but unremarkably at western prices too. The much cheaper indian type of supermarket, as in the UK is also nearby. The entry (not for disabled/steep flight of stairs to reception) up between shops ( as pic.) S.Delhi noise resounds around here by day, hotel is no retreat; sound of aircraft only, at night, no worse than Earl's Court. Location of GK is not far from Nehru Place and Lotus temple. The bonus, if that is one. Internet wireless connection possible from bedroom by day/evening only. The odd electricity failure and sound of noisy background generator was timely also, but the worst thing was the lack of towel rails and coat hooks, which brought our the ugly workmanship and lack of decor, to make more obvious the odd tile missing in the bathroom, lack of room servicing- in terms of inspection and then necessary cleaning.If you want to respect and rub shoulders with those living here in poverty, without dangerous rides on rickshaws and an unhealthy interest in sweeping your feet through market areas, here's a better option, contain things to a manageable level within the hotel, and ignore it outside painlessly. Auto taxi into town, tour e.g. with our 'VacationExperts' good, in excellent car, much needed to fit all sites into a couple of days. Recommended if you want to put everything in the perspective of price, and a middle of the road viewpoint.Taxi call service very good, 300-400 IRs for a 4 hour/or 40km max journey distance. Eg Connaught place AND BACK in about 30 mins eachway, I day ( 6 hours) Vac Exp driver (and recommended guide extra) 800RPs/80km max. i.e. driver waits in car park, while you visit, paying entrance fees.erspective of price, and a middle of the road viewpoint.

petite hotels ,"Don't believe the website and beware of attempts at rip-offs Be very sure that this place will suit you before you commit to staying here. You will be required to pay at least 50% of the tariff to confirm your booking, and you will have trouble if you change your mind about the period of your stay. You will also be asked to pay the full amount at check-in, and I would strongly recommend that you resist this request, because you will have a lot of trouble getting a refund if you decide to shorten your stay. I would not recommend that anyone book here sight unseen, because, despite all the hyperbole on the property's website, a lot of the information there is misleading in material ways. I booked 3 rooms for a party of 5 adults, and was initially shown a couple of bedrooms that could not be accessed independently. One could only get to the second bedroom through the first one. The bathroom could only be accessed across an unpaved outdoor courtyard. To get to this bathroom, the people in the first bedroom would have to pass through the second bedroom. When I suggested that this arrangement was not suitable, the owner claimed that the bathroom configuration was clearly stated on the website. I answered that the website described all the rooms as having attached bathrooms, and the owner said the site described these rooms as having an “adjacent” bathroom! At the time of writing, the website still states, under “Facilities”, “All rooms with exclusive attached bath/shower”.There were 2 other bedrooms where the bathroom was accessible only through the second bedroom, although in this case, at least the bathroom was under the same roof. The best room is the one on the roof, and although I pre-paid for this one we were directed to a more expensive room downstairs, and told that we would be charged at the same rate as the upstairs room. At check-out, this arrangement was forgotten. We ended up occupying the suites described on the website as the Emperor Petite and the Empress Petite. Although a small point, the advertised complimentary mineral water, chocolates and fruit basket did not materialise.The rooms were cluttered with all manner of knick-knacks, acting as very effective dust traps. The bed in the second bedroom of the Emperor suite was squeezed up against 2 walls, and although there was a small closet, it could not be used as there was no room for the door to open. There were also television sets in the bathrooms, but given the permanently wet surfaces caused by leaking plumbing fixtures, it is not advisable to turn these appliances on.The locality in which the property is situated is a very quiet and pleasant residential area, with a number of bungalows on large allotments. But there is no convenience shop within walking distance to meet travellers’ needs, such as drinking water. The metro station is 800 metres away, from where Connaught Place can be reached in 8 minutes.Despite reference to a cafe on the website, the only eating option is room service. Although the menu is extensive, only a very limited number of items is available. Due to the lack of eating places in the area, we cut our intended 5-day stay by 2 days. We informed the owner of our decision to check out early 24 hours in advance. His response was that we would lose the discount because discounts were only given for stays of 4 nights or more. According to the website, we should have been entitled to a discount of 15% for a stay of 3 nights. At checkout, the owner demanded an amount which did not include any discount, but included the higher cost of the downstairs room, and also a “retention fee” of Rs 9000. The retention fee was because we were checking out 2 days early, although the owner did not mention it when we notified him of our intention the previous day. We did not agree and eventually negotiated a sum which we considered fair. In a country with more advanced consumer protection laws, the owner’s pricing practices and service descriptions would attract the attention of regulators.The best thing about this property is the cheerful staff, especially Harish, who is on duty for extraordinarily long hours. "
petite hotels ,"Not a Gold Standard B Found this place on the Incredible India website in the gold category of B&amp;B. Travelling as a family of 4 adults, we needed 2 bedrooms, and so I opted for this sort of homestay accommodation (trying to keep the cost down at the same time).Having confirmed the booking, I discovered that breakfast was charged as extra! But perhaps that was because I got a 20% discount for staying 4 nights and they were trying to recoup the 'discount'.The place is very tired and in need of serious updating. The website pix do not bear resemblance to actual. A tiny sitting area, two bedrooms, one with creaking bed every time you turn over. There's no room to swing a cat, and you have to walk through one bedroom to reach the shabby bathroom with filthy shower curtain. Dodgy old wiring (my son's rather expensive NEW camera recharger and my NEW ipod recharger stopped working after we stayed there). A very old fan heater supplied in one of the bedrooms.On the plus side, the owners were helpful; they recommended a local taxi and we ended up using the driver for 3 days. They also told us where to go to get a bag repaired, phoned ahead to the shop to check its opening hours, and instructed the driver on where to take us.The real gem in this place is Hari, the houseman who attends to all your needs - making 'bed tea', breakfast and delicious evening snacks (his French fries are to be recommended). He is always smiling and cheerful.Be careful how many slices of toast your order - when we settled our bill, we discovered that we were charged per slice! "

radisson hotel delhi ,"One-hour for check-in at midnight despite arrangements to minimise check-in time I booked a room for my husband using one telephone call and more than 5 e-mails. All e-mails communicated clearly that (a) the room was essentially booked so that my husband could sleep well for a few hours, (b) he was arriving at midnight after having been on continuous travel for two days and he needed as much rest as he could get before leaving in the morning and (c) i would do what is possible to reduce his time on check-in and check-out formalities, just so that he could sleep a few minutes more. My credit card details were given via phone and i received a confirmation document as an e-mail attachment. As per my understanding, the room was now pre-paid.However, on arrival at midnight, my husband spent one hour just to check-in. After failing to convince them that he had a pre-paid room, my husband called me, then in Mumbai. I called the Manager who wondered why i had not accompanied my husband. I wondered in my mind how a person who did not understand the words 'single room' and 'my husband' had that job.The Manager told me that my credit card had not been charged and only used as a reserve to confirm the booking. When i asked the Manager why this info was not made clear to me before-hand when i have communicated the need to minimise my husband's time with check-in and check-out formalities, he had no answer except that he was following standard procedures. I called my husband back and asked him to make the payment. He did so and it was only after that, that he could go his room.Over the years, I have booked hotel rooms in different parts of the world in different ways and know that hotels who only use the credit card as a reserve mention this clearly. This clear communication removes scope for misunderstandings. Therefore, while booking with credit card, check whether your room is really pre-paid or just been reserved. This will save everyone's time and energy. Assuming that the hotel should inform us, is perhaps too much to expect, regardless of the price one pays for efficient service. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Best hotel near airport We stayed in Radisson Delhi for an overnight, we chose it only because it was the first one we found in our price range (10000 Rs maximum) near the airport.We were very suprised to find a real Palace, with top quality service (not even seen in higher priced hotels in India!).The rooms are modern, spacious and the beds are the softest I've seen in my life.The food is also very good, with the best breakfast I've eaten in India. Will definitely return there for my next overnight in Delhi.Only drawback: everything is occidental-styled, nothing looks Indian... "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Convenient location fantastic service at the restaurants and banquet rooms I was here to attend a conference for 1 week. The location is more appropriate for business people who have business/ meetings in Gurgaon. Its proximity to the airport is a big plus in my books given the unpredictable Delhi traffic.Admittedly, I was rather concerned after reading the not so favourable reviews. But my experience here was really quite good. The standard of service at the restaurants and the banquet rooms where the conference was held was fantastic. The food is wonderful which was a good thing for us as we ate in at the hotel the entire week. The reception and housekeeping end could be improved - I had requested for a late check out for a fee when I checked in but it was never inputted into the system. There were also days when I didn't get a laundry bag but apart from these small hiccups, my stay here was wonderful. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Highly recommended for business traveller needing to be near airport and Gurgaon A very pleasant stay. Rooms are well-furnished, comfortable, and clean. Collection from airport went without any hitch. Conference went smoothly, and events staff are to be highly commended for their service and attention to detail. Good selection of food from the three restaurants on-site - even after a week here without the opportunity to leave the hotel, I did not feel bored with the selection. Excellent wireless connection. Full service spa/salon on-site - a nice extra you don't often get in other business hotels. All in all, very happy with my first time stay at this hotel. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Great experience....but you pay for it. I have stayed at the Radisson severl times in the last few years and always have a fantastic stay. The staff is welcoming and accommodating and the food is great. It is certainly one of the nicer hotels in Delhi, but you pay for it. To compare this hotel to a similar hotel in New York or London, the cost should be much less, but isn't. If you can afford the rate, you won't be disappointed in the service and the property. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"loved the decor We have just returned from a week at the Ritz Carlton. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to the theme parks at all. In fact we didn't bother with Disney , having been before and just did a few trips to Universal. It was so hot and busy there, we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. We stayed on the club level with its own concierge and club lounge where 5 different food presentations are laid out each day. We were just expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc. During the afternoon it's literally like tea at the Ritz in London with champagne etc. Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that! The pool is lovely, not as big as the Marriott next door but more luxurious. Our kids are 11 and 13 and they enjoyed it. The pool attendants were wonderful, laying out 3 towels per sun lounger, with one rolled up as a head rest. The waitress even came into the pool with a tray of smoothies for everyone to try. The Spa is out of this world. Not for under 16 really but they were quite happy for my daughter to have some treatments. Expensive but fabulous. Restaurants are great. Normans is very smart and we dined there for our daughter's birthday. They even printed a special menu wishing her a happy birthday. We paid $299 per night for a room on the club level which we thought excellent value. There were 2 double beds so the four of us shared. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am extremely fussy! Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is theme parks, but if you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to the parks then this is an absolute must "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Second time here and My partner and I stayed here for 2 days and we're quite pleased with our stay here. This was my second time here so I knew what to expect. Great service and food. The hotel is close to the airport, which was good for us. "
radisson hotel delhi ,hated the Radisson hotel delhi - Extremely disappointed with the service. hotel lobby is nice. rooms dated and noisy if on the highway side. i was initially put in a room on the highway and asked to be change to the other side. the staff promised to get back to me in 1/2 hr. they forgot and finally moved me after 6hr. expensive hotel for the state the room is. The hotel does not see to have a focus on customers or customer service. staff though polite do not go out of there way to be helpful. they say they will get back to you but forget. they offered a CAA rate on the internet but do not honour it at checkin. they offered a weekend spa package but were reluctant to honour it. asked 4 times and got the run around. each time they would get back to me but seemed to forget. extremely poor value for the price.I travel on business extensively around the world and have never been treated so poorly. i am an female business traveller and Indian by descent and not sure if this had something to do with it. i usually a hotel goesout of their way to make their female guests feel safe and welcome. certainly not at the Radisson. 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Hotel excellent - restaurant awful I ordered smoked mussels. The first taste was awful old stinky fish smell. Yet I tried some more bites. I am hoping that I do not get any food poisoning.My customers and colleagues had minor complaints; al dente is al dente, and not crispy.Recommend: hotel yes, restaurant no. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"The worst hotel of our trip to India - Do not stay here! My partner and I spent over 3 weeks touring Northern India and because we did a basic tour we decided to end our holiday in what we thought was going to be pure luxury - The Radisson Delhi. How wrong could we be! Yes, the hotel lobby looks impressive, but the staff are rude and uncooperative. We were shown to our room which smelt of strong glue, so we were moved to a room that smelt of smoke. Eventually we settled for a third room which had a very noisy view of the motorway, complete with roosting pigeons directly outside the window. The food is ridiculously expensive because the hotel uses its own unique exchange rate! So beware. But the worst part about this hotel was that the following morning when we awoke a mouse scurried from under the bed. After reporting this to the manager he did apologise and discounted the meal from the previous evening, but that didnt make up for the shock of finding the mouse and realising that it had probably been in the room with us all night. A horrible hotel. Don't stay there! "

radisson hotel delhi ,"Clean and Convenient! The hotel was really clean.. the room (I stayed at Superior Room) was big and the bathroom was pretty good size too. The room service was on time and had many choices like Indian, Chinese, and &quot;American&quot;.. and the food was ok too.The front desk folks were very efficient.. not so informative.. but nice.The best part about the hotel was that it is about 10 minutes by car with a complimentary shuttle service to the Indira Gandhi International Airport as well as to the domestic airport. Not so good about the hotel was the concierge!I was a woman travelling alone (and first time at Delhi) and wanted to do some last minute shopping.. so I asked the concierge about taxi fare and some nice shopping places.. and this guy just brushed me off and told me that there are taxis parked outside the hotel.. just pay abour 250 rupees to go to marketplaces (not specifying which market places).. and that was it.. he didn't even give me a map or even directed me to the place to get a map or didn't even give me any info about their Travel Desk! So I went through the hotel services on my own and found this &quot;Travel Desk&quot; in the lobby (just a few steps from the concierge) and ended up hiring a driver for about 2000 rupees and went shopping safely and conveniently in downtown Delhi for about 4 hours!Anyways.. other than this.. I do recommend this hotel especially to people who have to catch an early flight and single travelers.. "

radisson hotel delhi ,"Pleasant Surprise! Superb... We booked this hotel as it is close to the airport and we needed an overnight stop to make our connection to Ranchi the following day.To be honest, we expected it to be functional and adequate. From the start we were pleasantly surprised. We were met at the airport by a friendly chauffeur: &quot;Welcome to India!&quot; and once in the car offered cold bottled water. The hotel itself was wonderful - we had a room upgrade as one of our daughters was sharing with us. The little extras with the upgrade were so welcome - chocolates, a complimentary drink - and the next morning the breakfast proved to be magnificent. We've stayed in many fine hotels but this one really was a 'hidden gem'.There is a spa which our daughter pronounced very good, and excellent internet facilities. We really did not want to leave! On our return we stayed at the Metropolitan which, while more central and convenient for sightseeing, was not such a pleasant experience. "

Great pool and public areas. Sumptous buffet. Very nice policies regarding late check-out prior to boarding AA 293 for 16 hour trip to Chicago. 
radisson hotel delhi ,Convinient location since i traveled for work to Delhi.. radisson seemed to be a convenient hotel because of it location.. it is close to the airport..The restaurant The Great Kebab Factory had delicious indian food. It had a wide variety of vegetarian food..The ambience of the hotel was very nice..The room was very spacious.. 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Short transit stay but felt like home This was an unplanned stop at Delhi, when my flight was delayed. I was there on a short business trip and had to stay overnight because my flight got cancelled. Since I had no reservation I just walked into the hotel, being the closest to the airport certainly helped. The staff was very courteous and treated me with the warmth as if I were a regular. I was very impressed with the service and it took away all the frustration which I had at the airport. I got a great room, and they also upgraded me to a high floor and a bigger room I guess. A quick tip is that this hotel also has less than 24 hour room booking for people who need the room only for a few hours. The next morning I had a meeting and I used the business center as well. I wasn't too impressed with the business center but then again I don't have anything against them. The food was great, and I also liked the relaxed ambience of the bar/lounge. Overall I think they have done a great job with a property at such a prme location. It is also conviniently located for people who might have work both in Gurgaon and Delhi. I give a thumbs up to this one! "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Loved the Great Kabab Factory Restaurant Very near to the ariport, so it is very convienent. This is my &quot;hotel of choice&quot; and have stayed here while I was in India for business and pleasure.I recommend their superior rooms. I like the comfy beds and their hospatality is second to none.You can schedule your pickup/drop from/to the airport with their friendly staff over the phone or online "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Nice Hotel Good Staff What food at the kabab factory. absolutely awesome. The room was really nice and we liked it a lot. They were very kind to give us a late check out. Close to the airport, neat and clean and would return "
radisson hotel delhi ,"stylish property Featuring excellent service, high standards of comfort and a genuine hospitality, this stylish property is a perfect venue for a pleasant as well as a relaxing stay.Guests can dine at the onsite restaurant that serves delectable Indian, Italian as well as Chinese cuisine. You can also relax at the cafe with snacks and beverages as well as sip on various cocktails at the cosy bar. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Badly needs renovation After staying at Radisson Goa, this hotel was a big let down. The rooms need serious renovations though the breakfast was outstanding. Even check in check out was very efficient. With renovation this can be a hotel of choice for airport transfers and those who want to stay between delhi and gurgaon "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Good choice if you don't want to explore the city I was in Delhi on transit. Have chosen this hotel because of two reasons: 1. Name - I didn't want any surprises and was looking for international chain hotel.2. Closeness to airport.The second proved to be useless. If you're going from Delhi to Europe the distance from airport eventually does not matter that much as most of the flights scheduled around midnight or early morning. Roads are anyway empty at that time.Positive sides. Very good and reasonably priced restaurant in the lobby. Nice breakfasts. Free airport transfers from and to airport included. A swimming pool. Annoying. Noisy air conditioning in the room. If you are really sensitive to noises check if your room will have windows towards courtyard. I had a room with windows on highway: actually it's ok, but I know that for someone (like my dad for example) even thick double-glazed windows will not bring quiteness if he gets a highway right in front of his eyes. Personnel in general are nice and friendly. To sum up I would recommend the hotel to those who are not interested in exploring Delhi downtown but need a rest after business meetings or some exotic trips around the country. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"The beautiful fountain I had visited to Radison in Oct 2006 .I went there to attend my boss first marriage anniversary The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely . It was so hot and busy there, we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel.We stayed on the club level with its own concierge and club lounge where 5 different food presentations are laid out each day. We were just expecting a few nibbles but dinner was awesome. After dinner, we took ice-cream and it was terrific.Although the hotel was expensive but you will surely enjoy and you forget all those money which you spent over there.Waiters are great.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday. As it's expensive however you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to the parks then this is an absolute mustOverall it's best what i experienced:) "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Once more! - Very apt location, near airport- very good service "
radisson hotel delhi ,"wonderful experience nice servicesnice membership schemesnear to airporteasy to find,overall wonderful five star "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Good Food Costly Hotel is Excellenat, Cost wise is high, for business purpose it is nice hotel "
radisson hotel delhi ,Full marks for Top Class Hotel !! I travel frequently to Dehli and the Radisson Hotel Delhi is always my first choice.I give full marks for all the staff at the Radisson Hotel Delhi.There is a wide choice of food arrays and and facilities.The Business class rooms are large and very well furnished. But I can say without any reserve that all of the staff are so very professional and always helpful and caring.The best thing about the hotel also is that it is very near to the airport.What else can I say? &quot;its always a pleasure&quot; to stay at The Radisson Hotel Delhi 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Very good and friendly Hotel near the Airport-free of charge pick-up I stayed in the Radisson in Delhi for 1 night, needing to catch a connecting flight the next day. Everything worked perfectly well with the complementary pick up organised from the airport (just indicate your flight number and arrival time to the hotel staff in advance): I arrived very late at night on my own, but encountered no problems as a woman. The driver was very curteous. Hotel check-in very smootly, well trained reception staff, very clean room (one disadvantage: my room showed to the side where the motorway ran past; but not too much noise). Uncomplicated transfer back to the airport the next morning. I can recommend this hotel "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Good staying experience The hotel is positioned in such a location that it is extremely accessible from the airport.The service is excellent. The staff are extremely polite, know what they are doing and helpful.Though I did not get sufficient time to use all the services provided by the hotel I would surely vouch for their service, the great food and room service. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Pricey and boring Stayed at the Radission just for a night. It is pricey. Everyone knows that. I was staying for a night availing one of their privilege schemes. There was a big problem at the reception to start with. They could not trace the confirmation number given to me. I had a email confirmation with me and had a printout to back my claim. Was made to wait for 30 min till it was sorted out. It appears to me that the privilege scheme that they run is an independent operation run by a third party. Confirmations from the Privilege club do not seem to carry much sanctity. After the hassle checked into the hotel. Room services takes too long for comfort. It makes sense to go down to the restaurants and grab something on the go than wait eternally for the room service to show up. for the kind of price that is being paid , it is definitely the class of service expected. All in all , a disappointing stay. "
radisson hotel delhi ,Best Business Hotel The best hotel ever statyed on business visit. The best part is the hotel is very close to the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Hence you can avoind most of New Delhi's jap packed roads. Fod is great. Rooms are awesome. 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Awesome hotel It is a very good hotel, close to the airport.Very good rooms .Kebab Factory is an awesome eating place.I surely recommend this property. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Luxury with professionalism I have stayed there a couple of time on a personal visit. This hotel is very conveniently located from the airports (both domestic &amp; international). There was an Indian Airlines shuttle from the airport (i came to know of it as some of my luggage waslate and IC dropped it to the hotel).Anyway, rooms are nice, however, I noted in my 2nd trip that rooms at the back of the hotel have a better view (than of the national highway) and are quieter. The pool and gym were both very good. The Great Kebab Factory serves some excellent kebabs. Staff is frendly and professional. Overall, a good experience. "
radisson hotel delhi ,Nice It is very convenient place as it is close to the airport and thus saves one from the bad delhi traffic. 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Best Hotel for Business traveller to Delhi It is one of the best hotels I have stayed in my life time. Starting from the grand Entry of the hotel to the reception, everything was very smoth. the reception staff was cooperative, thet checked the best deal for the room rate beforehand so that i get the best value for money. After checking in the executive suite on the lounge floor (1st), I rushed to the kebab Factory restaurent, and ordered the five course non-vegetarian kebab meal. Let me tell you that the meal was so delicious , I had never eaten such kebabs in my life. After Dinner I went to my suite, the bed was so elaborately layed with some many pillows to help me catch a sound sleep. In the morning I had my breakfast in the executive Lounge, i throughly enjoyed. When i checked out in the afternoon to go to the airport there was already a luxury sedan waiting for me to drop me at the airport. "
radisson hotel delhi ,Great Conference room facilities Excellent in both hospitality and comfort!!! The business conference room facility where our international conference was held was great!!!! The arrangements made by the hotel management and staff for the conference were excellent!!!Hats off to the Radisson Hotel's service!!! 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Nice Hotel We stayed here for one night on our way to Shimla. The airport pick up and drop of service was excellent the drivers were helpful and courteous. The check in was was a breeze, our room was very clean and comfortable. The only down side was it was at the front of the hotel overlooking the National Highway thankfully the double glazing managed to supress most of the noise. The rooms at the back have a better view and are quieter, the pool and gym were both very good. The staff at the hotel were great and could not do enough for you. The choice of resturants is also good in particular NYC the choice of food here is very varied and of a good quality with either a buffet or a la carte menu and good value for money. The hotel is also ideally situated for both the domestic and international airports and saves the 40 to 60 minute drive to the hotels downtown. All in all our one night here was a very pleasant experience. "
radisson hotel delhi ,Little bit of luxury My partner and I stayed at the Radisson the night before our flight home. It is very close to the airport hence why we picked this hotel. From the time we were picked up from the airport to the moment we got dropped off we had first class service. The drivers are so friendly very chatty and helpful. Check was very easy and the staff were super friendly and welcoming. The room was amazing and so was the bathroom. The hotel is incredible so beautfiul and spacious. The Kebab Factory was the best thing. The food there is some of the best we had in India and the service was excellent. The pool and spa are wonderful too. I was recommend this hotel to everyone wanting to stay in Delhi. It was the icing on the cake to a perfect holiday. 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Everything was perfect We spent 1 1/2 days here before a midnight flight home and all was wonderful. On internet reservations site we put the flight # and arrival time in Remarks portion and when we walked out of terminal a Radisson man was holding a sign up with our name. We never had to confirm or do anything else. No looking for a hotel shuttle. We were upgraded to the club floor which offered free internet, breakfast and cocktails. We also got a plate with chocolates and a plate with cookies, plus coffee maker, fruit. It looked like the room had been recently refurbished. Incredible bed, wonderful toiletries of all types, big towels, walk in shower (no bath tub), desk, easy chair with ottoman, everything. We ate in coffee shop twice (breakfast buffet was okay) , had drinks in cocktail lounge twice (great service here). They also handled some minor items for us - postage and mailing, shuttle back to airport, reservations confirmation. All in all, this was actually our favorite hotel in India (including a Taj). The hotel is primarily a meeting and stop over place due to airport location (about 2 miles or 15 minutes away) and was very busy with business men (few women were present). The lobby cocktail lounges do a great business - was hard to find a table once. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Much much improved We stayed in the Radisson, Delhi in November 2006 and had an awful experience. The staff then were appalling (rude and condescending and wonderful at ignoring guests) and many things were missing or did not work. We stayed again in November and December 2008 and it is obvious that the appointment of a new resident manager has transformed this hotel. The staff are now pleasant and helpful and everything that should have worked did work – including hot water in the (club) room where all the lights worked (in contrast to our first visit). Reception staff still need to sharpen up their act (it took us 22 minutes to check in the first time and 15 minutes the second) but the improvement is palpable. Our airport transfers were also arranged by the hotel and were very impressive, with uniformed chauffeur. None of this queuing for a shuttle bus; transfers are by car and not shared with other guests – and, on arrival, one is met by a hotel representative as well as the driver.This is now a Radisson at the airport rather than being merely an airport hotel. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Great location for business traveler smooth service. We were returing from a long business trip around Asia and stayed at the Radisson for one night only while waiting for our next morning departure from IGR airport. The location of the hotel was excellent (compared to the traffic in New Delhi in general). Our pick-up from the airport was complimentary and it worked great. The smooth service started from the the pick-up and continued all the way through our short stay. Room was pleasant and the business lounge/centre had everything I needed to work during the evening. The breakfast in lounge was also a very pleasant surprise. Very Indian and in a pleasant way excotic. The next time I visit Delhi, I will most likely use the same hotel due to service, location and reasonble prices. Totti PS. The hotel did also respond to my feedback with one logistical problem in a very fast manner which I value quite highly. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Excellent service at a little steep price Hotel is comfortably located close to the domestic and international airport so one can totally avoid the crazy Delhi Traffic. Hotel offers all one can expect from an international chain. Best part about the hotel is the staff which was really helpful. They not only guided guests to my room who often visited at odd hours but also escorted an acquaintance, who was lost in the vast property, upto the door of my room. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Good Very good hotel, Nice clean rooms, We got a real american hamburger at the hotel, first time we got real meat in India.Breakfast was average. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Instant service with a smile While this hotel is everything you would expect for the price what stands out here is the service. Any request was accommodated immediately. Spotless rooms with fresh fruit, chocolates and cookies on arrival. English was never a problem. The breakfast buffet was amazing. We were coming and going from here, both to the jungle and the airport and everything went smoothly. The location might be a bit out of the way if you want to explore New Delhi more but it worked perfectly for us. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Does what it says on the can We spent one night at the Radisson before flying home and it was fine for the purpose required. The room was clean and well appointed although the carpet had definitely seen better days. We were there on New Year's Eve and although the early evening service level in the bar was very good, the same could not be said for the restaurant. The main restaurant was only offering a buffet option, no a la carte menu, and they advised us to use the lobby area restaurant if we wanted to order a la carte. However, when we did so we were told that no gravy items were being served, which essentially wiped out the majority of the Indian side of the menu and left us with a choice of sandwiches and chips. We ordered two starters but the waiter only ordered one of them and then had to do the other later, and the same happened with the main course where we ordered two of the same sandwich but only one arrived. This is fine for an airport hotel but I don't imagine many people would spend more than one night there. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Fine for Overnight We stayed here following a flight which arrived at midnight and before a morning flight the next day.Frankly we could have been anywhere - Chicago, Sydney......However the beds were comfortable, the rooms well appointed and the double glazing very efficient at filtering out the traffic noise from this wonderful city. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"overpriced room and annoying staff This hotel was chosen for me by the company's travel desk and I stayed for 4 nights.Being on a business trip, I would not have to care about the price - but the experience was so unpleasant (considering this hotel's rating) that I need to share it.The room:- it was clean, but its better days were definitely over - based on the bathroom alone, the hotel should be rated one or two stars less - but then again, if having marble floor makes you ignore a not-so-clean toilet (and no brush to clean it yourself), you may be just happy with it...The staff:- on arrival, my confirmed reservation was missing from their system; after a few minutes of searching, I was given a room booked for another person... the official justification being that his first name sounded similar to mine (!)- getting a red rose from a male receptionist did make me feel slightly uncomfortable- buying some refreshments in hotel's brasserie turned into a grotesque, when the cashier did not know how to charge the items, called for help and at one point there were 5 employees loudly discussing the problem; but hey, what am I complaining about, I was able to take my buns to the room in the end.- staff does not really understand the border line between &quot;helpfull and friendly&quot; and &quot;annoyingly intrusive&quot; - they were overdoing it time and time again:- waiter in one of the hotel's restaurant asking about my satisfaction every couple of minutes; when I finally finnished the diner, I was virtually forced to fill in some kind of evaluation form for him- when trying to relax in the pool, the attendant asked whether I would be interested in a drink or perhaps jacuzzi; nothing wrong with that, and I politely said I was doing just fine - only to be forced to repeat it (not so politely anymore) two more times, as he was coming back with the same questions again and againsummary: this is in no way a five star hotel - what a waste of money, which even the close distance from the airport cannot compensate... "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Excellent airport layover spot Flights from US to India usually arrive in the early evening, with connecting domestic flights not leaving unitl the next morning.This hotel is only ten minutes from the Delhi airport and is a great spot to spend the night before traveling on.be sure to let the hotel know when you're going to arrive, and they will have a car and driver waiting for you at the airport. That will save you time and avoid the taxi chaos.Service is abundant and excellent. The rooms are very well-maintained, with up-to-date fixtures and amenities. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"useful airport stopover Arriving in Delhi from Europe is often a surreal experience, usually taking in an early morning landing after a long flight. The close proximity of the Radisson to the airport and the reliable transfer service are significant plusses. The hotel is avarage in quality, but comfortable enought to let you acclamatise to India. The restaurant still has a menu on at 2am which makes a useful top up after airline food. Hotels in Delhi are all expensive but the Radisson is good value for money. If transitting Delhi it is a worthwhile resting place. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Terrible overpriced experience We stayed at the Radisson in the luxury suite and paid a very high premium price. The worst issue was the deplorable condition of the room. The first deluxe room smelled horrible, like mould, and you could see water damage on the walls. (The smell made me sick and was intolerable.) The bed was uneven with a convex shape. We complained and were moved to another room and it did smell a bit better, and were provided a very small discount when we checked out. However the room again had water damage and both rooms were not in good repair and were dated in their appearance. The bathrooms were cramped and not at all luxurious. The linens were average with below average, scratchy and small sized robes. We also were not given the level of service and concern we would expect at this price, especially concerning the deplorable condition of the first room and the less than average condition of the second &quot;deluxe&quot; room. The pool itself &quot;looks&quot; gorgeous but was is terrible condition with thick scum in the &quot;hot&quot; tub. The main pool was ice cold. The business centre was expensive and was not even included in this 'luxury room'.We would not normally complain regarding a hotel but this was so terrible we needed to say something. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Benign hotel... and seems to be getting better The Radisson is a decent hotel close to the airport and it's proximity is it's main feature. It is undergoing extensive rennovations and I look forward to their completion. I've stayed there a number of times, most recently in Feb 08.Check InUsually takes quite some time but is steadily getting faster. For some reason they don't seem to enter all details when the reservation is made, so there is much typing going on during the process, and rooms are never pre-allocated even for repeat guests.Rooms.I've never had a standard room, only executive suite and these two room suites are nice. The a/c works well in most of them, beds are firm, room is spacious, internet works, but the rooms are old and -while VERY clean - are due for a re-fit.GymSmall, but has 2 new life-fitness ellipticals and 2 new + 2 old treadmills. 2 bikes as well. Only one tv so one must share which is something I don't like to do when relieving the boredom of my workout. Some circuit weight machines and some free weights / dumbells. Nicest feature of the gym is the hotel will readily open it at any hour on request. FoodThe Chinese restaurant is quite good. Bar food is OK. Bar itself has no ventilation so if you're a non-smoker it's intolerable but the lobby lounge area is quite nice and has good service. Breakfast in the club lounge is very limited and service in the club lounge is shoddy. The breakfast presented looks like they took the chafing dishes from last night's wedding and just put them out again for breakfast. Breakfast in the restaurant (coffee shop) is a wee bit better.ServiceConstantly improving. Check OutNot well enough staffed... often there are long queues at check out and since they take 10 minutes per person, a 3 person wait can easily be 1/2 hour!Overall, this is a tolerable hotel in New Delhi. Not well located for business meetings in the city, but the ideal choice for transit or for meetings on that side of the city. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Great experience I was thrilled with the service at the Radisson New Delhi. They picked us up from the airport. Then when we arrived they offered us free upgrades for our rooms. It was a wonderful experience to stay at such a nice hotel. I would recommend the Radisson to anyone who wants to stay by the airport. For those who want to see the city, the Radisson is rather far from the city. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Radisson Delhi is pretty good Rates are very high (Rs.13K/night and up), but that's Delhi.Rooms are normal size; We found KSize bed very comfortable-matress' are firm (if you dislike firm, you will dislike the bed).TV was old, small. Channel selections minimal.Fitness center is very small, borderline claustraphobic (sp?).Front and other staff seemed friendly at all our interactions.Cleanliness was fine in rooms and public areas.Restaurants are under refurb., and the Italian serves as a multi-cuisine cafe/diner/buffet potpurri (sp?).Food was fine. Room service Indian dishes were very tasty, but very expensive.Mystery to me why dishes like yellow dal, green salad, Biryani, etc always have to be 5-8X the cost of what they are outside the hotel. You cant catch any breaks in Indian 5Star hotels when it comes to food or drink; you will be gouged with amazing consistency.Club Level lounge here runs &quot;happy hour&quot; till 930PM, which is much more realistic than, say, the Crowne Plaza at New Friends Colony, which has the ignorant habit of closing at 8PM (about the time you will get back from a reg. day of business and need tranquilization).Club Lounge staff are very nice folk here.Mainly, be advised, hotel literature will explain that extensive renovations are underway (no ETA given, must be Q3FY08 or later). So, rooms, restaurants, health clun and spa will all be MUCH nicer later than they are now.Undoubtedly. But that doesn't diminish your obligation to hand over US$400.+/night for a property that is going to be &quot;much improved&quot; later. For now its, clean, safe, comfortable and warmly decorated (and in dire need of renovations).Other note: The Grand Hotel located about 5Km from here at Vasant Kunj, is nicer overall, but the &quot;modern&quot; decor and floor plan of the rooms there is so off-putting to me that I just hate it; don't like to stay there just for that.It has better fitness center, foodservice, TV and general lay-out than the Radisson, at about the same cost and roughly same &quot;airport&quot; location. "
radisson hotel delhi ,good experience Stayed three times at the radisson delhi with my wife and 3 daughters.Hotel is about 45 minutes from the Red fort but close to the Qtub Minar and Airport.Rooms are good and clean and restaurents serve excellent cuisine.The staff are extemely helpful and they upgraded us on our last 2 nights and offered us late check-out.Not in the city center but a very good experience. 
radisson hotel delhi ,Excellent Airport Hotel - Stayed here for 3 nights pre and post our trip around India. Excellent standard of rooms with a great free airport shuttle. I'Ching restaurant is superb with good food and attentive service. Staff were helpful and courteous and the breakfast was also good. Recommended 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Terrible Experience I was traveling to Nepal and had a stopover in Delhi. Although the room was terribly expensive, I have had good experiences with the Radisson chain in the past and it was close to the airport. The Delhi hotel was awful. My room was not clean, but the worst part was the staff. They were rude and condescending whenever I asked for help or made any request. For over $400.00, I would expect to be treated respectfully. Whatever hotel you pick, don't stay at the Delhi Radisson!! "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Somewhat bland business hotel but a real haven The Radisson is a fairly bland place, full of earnest local business people in suits, with tedious canned muzak playing in the foyer. But it turned out to be a real haven when we stayed there at the beginning and end of a 5 day Indian tour. We arrived before 7 am after an exhausting flight from London, and were warned that we might not get our room until after twelve noon, but they actually gave us our room at 8 am, which meant we could crash out for a few hours before our first organised tour of Delhi in the afternoon - we really needed that! At the end of our tour, the hotel was once again a real haven, suffering as we were from the final stages of Delhi Belly. Our rooms were at the back of the hotel, away from the flyover, and were spacious, clean and very comfortable. Service was friendly, courteous and efficient. The food was good as well - the Great Kebab Factory Restaurant was closed for &quot;regradation&quot;, but the Mediterranean Restaurant had some good Indian dishes on the menu, and we enjoyed a truly delectable Indian vegetarian meal on our first evening. Breakfasts were excellent as well. All in all, we had good reason to be thankful for being at the Radisson. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Accomdations okay Service lacking Stayed at the Radisson, Delhi for about a week. Although the room and hotel were well kept, overall I was not impressed with the service. I had arranged for an early check-in since my flight landed early morning. The Radisson driver received me at the airport, however, upon check-in I had to wait about 20 mins for a room to be prepared. (I booked a superior room through Travelocity).The 'superior' room was small and was lacking a safe and min-bar, which for me are both necessities. Also I noticed the window view was of the highway and also the decorative balcony was filled with bird droppings. I requested to be shifted to a room with a safe at a minimum and that night my request was accommodated and I shifted into a business room.The business room had a safe, min-bar and view of the terrace so I was complacent with the accommodation. The service, however, was a different story. To be fair, some services were up to par, for example room service and business center services were fine.However I found the staff overall to be unfriendly and not very well trained. My previous Delhi stays were at the Taj Palace, which in comparison provides excellent customer service in all aspects.While working out in the gym, for example, staff did not seem to know to turn on the AC when customers were working out. Instead they were busy vacuuming which added to the stuffiness and poor ventilation in the gym. When I asked for assistance in programming the treadmill, apparently the English speaking gym attendant was not around, so another staffer experimented with the different buttons to try and help. I used the treadmill in quick start mode alternatively. Later when the English speaking gym attendant returned, he spent some time training the junior staffers on how to program the machines (for customers like myself during his absence). This all happened on the treadmill next to mine during my workout so it was very annoying. I really doubt the English skills and English fluency of the staff. Once, when I had completed my workout and was set to leave, a staffer suddenly appeared and awkwardly asked, &quot;May I assist you Sir?&quot; I felt that he might have been practicing his English with me, as the timing of his delivery was just awkward. One other thing about the gym, I asked to use the steamroom. Since it was under renovation, they asked if I'd like to use the Jacuzzi. I agreed, however later I found an attendant filling up an oversized bathtub with water in the locker room area. When I realized that was the Jacuzzi, I declined to use it.In the breakfast buffet, I found the staff only spoke when spoken to. And aside from notifying customers that the buffet was going to close shortly, they did not provide much service. Many times they were standing around waiting to provide service. But hardly ever did they offer their services without being called. This was the opposite of the service I experienced at Taj Palace (during my previous Delhi stays) where staff went out of their way to provide exceptional service. In fact, Taj staff acknowledged my presence at every opportunity with greetings like Good Morning Mr. Khanna, or by opening the door or elevator. On the other hand, Radisson service was lacking. I once passed the lobby staff on the way to the restaurant and found them exchanging silent glances with me without uttering a word.Overall, I have no complaints with the amenities and accommodations. However, having previously stayed at a 5 star hotel that provides superior service, I found Radisson’s service to be less than satisfactory. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Nice convenient stopover in Delhi I stayed here one night during a business trip as our flight from US came in too late for us to get the domestic flight to the office on same day.

Recommend calling the front desk if this happens rather than having to fight the charges like she did. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"A Positive Experience at the Radisson I found my stay at the Radisson to be a very pleasant one. First, its very close to the airport and therefore very suitable for business travelers or anyone that needs to get to the airport in a hurry. I stayed on the club floor, and must say that the rooms on that floor were very nice. It was a suite with a very large living space and large bedroom, two bathrooms. The room was well appointed and I was impressed with the nice selection of magazines and newspapers they provided in the room. The breakfast was quite good as well. The pool looked really nice, although I did not go in. The one drawback was that the surrounding area was not so nice. I believe there was a wall, so perhaps you wouldn't see it while at the pool.I also stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi and found the Radisson to be infinitely nicer and newer. Although I disagree with the five star rating, (its probably somewhere between a three and four), its certainly a solid hotel for business travelers. I would definitely stay here again if I were to come back to Delhi and need to be near the airport. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Great hotel near the airport If you need to be near the airport and need a nice clean place to stay, then stay at the radisson. the food in the restaurants were good. the bed is hard. the room is clean (typical of a chain hotel). the service was good. we paid about $150usd. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Good choice near airport Were picked up at the airport by a nice driver from the Radisson near the airport, which had been recommended by a friend whose parents live in New Delhi. Quite nice and convenient to the airport, though not cheap and I thought it was a little musty for an upscale hotel. But wonderful buffet breakfast—the best of the trip. Would only stay there if I were flying into Delhi in the evening and flying out the next morning, but a very good choice for that purpose. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Suitable for business overpriced like all hotels in the area I stayed here on business a number of time between January and June 2006 and would recommend it as a place to stay when on business or if you need to be close to the aiport.Like all hotels in Delhi, this place is overpriced for what you get but with the big influx of multinationals to Gurgaon over the last few years the hotel prices have increased dramatically - supply v demand at the end of the day.The hotel is clean, the staff friendly and the complimentary airport shuttle is a bonus. The rooms are large but somewhat worn and could do with being upgraded. The bed is hard.The food is fine with a good variey of both local and European options. The pool area is fine - pleasant enough as a place to spend a few hours.Be sure to have a driver and dont expect to walk anywhere locally as there realy isnt much of interest in the area. If you can tolerate the traffic its preferable to stay in Delhi or if on a bigger budget stay at the Trident Hilton in Gurgaon - definitely a few classes above this hotel. "
radisson hotel delhi ,Overpriced- not to go place if you can avoid I stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel compares to a 3 star facility in Canada although they call it 5 star. The rates are overpriced for what the hotel offers. The rooms are at best 3 star. The hotel restuarant is basic- nothing fancy about it. The buffet is cold food even if hot. If you have a choice stay somewhere else because for this price you can probably get a better hotel 
radisson hotel delhi ,"An unfortunate shame in the Radisson experience I like the Radisson experience. It is usually a very nice hotel even if standard and sometimes unoriginal managed by very nice people.In the case of the one in Delhi, the rooms have space even if it is already a little deprecated. The restaurants provide nice cuisine and have very nice personnel.The swimming pool is rather small and the swimming pool personnel is quite absent. The spa is small but efficient. Very nice massages.The main problem in the hotel is the front desk that has a lot of difficulties to crack a smile (even if some of them do make an effort, they are too small a number) and also is quite unefficient.They really need to learn what means 'customer service'! For the price asked by this hotel, one would not expect such displeasure. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"An Airport Hotel - Nothing More Nothing Less It's amusing to read the extremes that people experienced, now I've visited the hotel. Obviously it's down to personal experience - and individual personalities - as I found this hotel to be very neutral. It's negatives (RIGHT outside a noisy brand new 6 lane overpass, thin walls &amp; doors, very little to see or do on foot) are outweighed by the positives (clean rooms, very polite staff, rose on the bed at turn-down - haha).The overpass is really new and as a result, the hotel doesn't seem to be as soundproofed as it should be - especially if you're at the from of the hotel.If you can't get anything better in the area - this place isn't going to ruin your life but I would suggest you try and look for availability at the higher ranking places first. Also make sure you hire a driver for the day, rather than booking taxis - you'll save lots of money. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Aweful Treatment We have just returned from a wonderful two week stay in India. Everywhere we stayed we were well treated and there wre no problems. We came in from a Varanasi flight which was late in. When we arrived, the Radisson said they knew nothing about our booking. They would not accept our agent in Delhis attempts to send faxes of the copy bookings. Our men came out of their offices in Delhi to sort out the problem. They either do not have a working system for bookings or more likely they overbook and if you are late ....you have had it!!!!The lobby manager just looked blank and it took our guide from the airport and me and then the directors of the Indian part of our tour company to get anywhere. The result was being sent to the Grand Hotel for the night. They need training to deal with customer complaints and they need to stop over booking. This is not the way to treat clients. One and a half hours of arguing in the lobby after a tiring day is just not on. I had to insist on a more senior manager coming down as the guy in the lobby didn't have any idea how to behave. I wouldn't recommend anyone to take a chance on this place as it was difficult with support. If you arrive without local help you would be left with no where to sleep for the night! "
radisson hotel delhi ,Fantastic Concierge Desk service... Date: .We had missed the flight and needed a hotel for one night. Turns out hotels were impossible to find in Delhi that weekend due to doctor convention. We came to Radisson and were impressed by lobby and the front-desk staff. We wanted to take the room but they had none available. They were booking their own customer at other hotels (due to over booking). The concierge desk guy (forgot his name) was superb.He must have spent 1 hr trying to find us another 5* hotel. Finally we left in with our driver to look around other hotels. We could not get reservation anywhere. Called back Radisson and he said he will try again. We had lunch there and he indeed found us a nice 4* hotel very near airport (15 minute by car) Hotel Icon. (I will have another report for this). We loved the hotel Icon tower. Any way I must say Radisson concierge staff went out of their way to find us accomodation.Robert 
radisson hotel delhi ,"Fantastic hotel Stayed here in early December for one night. Needed to be close to the airport due to an early morning flight back to the UK.Previously stayed in Le Meridien Delhi for a comparable price. This hotel is far better! The Lobby area is huge and quite impressive. There are several dining options as well as a bar. Opted for room service instead as I didn't have enough time. It was somewhat expensive but the food was pretty good and there was a very good selection available.This was my first trip to India and having stayed in three hotels in five days, I quickly learned that the rooms can be quite noisy, especially if you have a standard room facing the front of the hotel. The noise from the traffic is awful. Luckily I had booked a quiet room towards the back of the hotel. It was slightly more expensive but definitely worth it for the extra sleep (I needed to wake up at 4am). The room was pretty big, well furnished, comfortable, good decor and the bathroom was fine with nice toiletries. I couldn't locate a safe in the room, despite looking around the room twice. I thought this was very bizarre. As I was there for just a night it wasn't an issue.If you need to be very close to the airport and you want a good luxury hotel - stay here! I couldn't find any other hotel in the vicinity of the airport that would be anywhere near as good as this one. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"pleasant airport hotel I note mixed comments in other reports but we found the staff helpful , room was more than adequate and good hotel facilities . Nice pool and the Kebab restaurant is excellent . Overall no complaints and would stay here again . "
radisson hotel delhi ,"OK but... Stayed here for 2 nights, one at the beginning of our holiday and one at the end. In general the hotel was very good. However, on both nights our room was at the front of the hotel and there was considerable traffic noise. Also, the guy in charge of calling taxis at the front of the hotel uses his microphone all night to do this, and that too disturbed our sleep. When the huge flyover in front of the hotel finally opens, I can only think this will be a hotel to be avoided. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Everything you'd expect from a 4* airport hotel It was a relief to see the man with the Radisson sign as we left the dump that is Delhi airport! A short drive later and we were, quite honestly, stunned by the hugely impressive lobby of the Radisson. The rooms, unfortunately, are not as impressive and are showing signs of wear, but they do the job. The hotel has a number of large restaurants, from formal to coffee shop style, plus a beauty salon, pool etc. We had a club room so had breakfast in the club lounge, a little oasis of quiet on the first floor with very polite and professional service. A car from our hotel in Agra then arrived to pick us up and off we went, glad we had been able to avoid downtown Delhi until later in our holiday. One tip - if you are flying OUT of Delhi late at night, the hotel offers short-stay rates for a few hours but you need to contact them directly to book. This is far better than hanging around the airport, which has almost no shops and a very small waiting area. "
radisson hotel delhi ,"Bad! Went there for one night as my flight home was the next morning. Thank god it was one night!The reception staff missed my reservation, they had the wrong spelling of my name. I only found my reservation through my agent! The rooms were small, and full of stains on virtually everything. The towels in the bathroom had holes you put you hands in! We had two electricity blackouts in one day.The breakfast was fine but with bad service.Would stay in the Oberoi New Delhi next time. "

rahul palace hotel ,"Fantastic hotel this is one of the greatest hotels we once ever lived from the whole world. especially Mr. Satyawan, an excellent manager who support and help us a lot during our first Indian trip. "
rahul palace hotel ,"very good location friendly and helpfull staff good rooms I've been there twice during my india travels and the staff was really nice, friendly and helpfull. the location is a really good value. the hotel has a nice rooftop terrasse and the rooms are good value. If I'm going back to Delhi I would go there again. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Great value I had stayed here before and totally loved it. I love that you can trust the staff and that they genuinely do all they can to help you.Hot water is not reliable here but I can bathe in tepid water no problem.I'm not fond of the room decor so I buy a pretty sheet, remove the drab spread and tuck it in the closet. I also reccommend you use your own towels. White towels become grey in India so fast and just never look or smell clean enough to me.I loved that they remebered me as soon as I arrived. And that was three years previous. Also most all the staff were the same an indication to me that the manager is treating them well.On this trip I met the owner. I simple lovely man.This place is a favourite even among middle class Indians. I love that you can meet locals here.In terms of the room - the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms have showers and buckets, but in ours the drain was too slow.The big plus is free wireless internet throught the hotel and a small fridge in the room!! There's also a TV with plenty of channels to watch. And you're in the heart of shopping heaven! "
rahul palace hotel ,"Great service great value: Stay here! I ha1ve stayed t 4 hotels in Delhi: One grotty one in Old Dlhi, one with cock roaches in Pahar ganj, one OK one in Karol Bagh, then I had a booking for Hotel Swati, but they were over booked. They recommended a nice clean hotel down the street: Rahul Palace. I have really enjoyed my stay here. The service is great, the breakfast service with a smile and the rooms very clean. They also have hot water 24 hours. If I came back to Delhi I would stay here again. Good value in a safe area. Because the agency that I booked under made a mistake Swati Hotel had recommended Rahul Palace. It was a very busy time and all the hotels were taken. One night I stayed in a room, the following night the owner gave me his own office (with bedroom area) to sleep in, free of charge! He said that if I didn't stay he would have to take me home to his family, because there were no rooms in the city. So ignore the bad reviews, if you want a place where the staff will look after you, wireless, clean rooms, hot water and happy staff come here. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Disgusting Stay Away! Absolute rubbish, the electricity was not working in our room. Took 3 servants to fix this. There was poo in the toilet(!) and the stench almost made me spew up. And yet the had the pride to put a &quot;sanatised for your protection&quot; ribbon around the toilet and to make matters worse, the toilet wouldnt even flush. Two servants were sent up to attempt repairs and after four visits they could not get the toilet to flush. Also constant hammering noises as maintenance workers were fixing the hot water system at midnight. no hot water, very disgruntled, arrogant receptionist. requested another room and they agreed, but they called back later saying that all rooms have the same problem!! Checked out the next morning, and the receptionist said there was an additional service charge which he hadn't disclosed before when we confirmed the gross price the day before. We refused to pay the service charge and he didnt even give us a discount for our nightmare stay at this &quot;palace&quot;. A complete circus. STAY AWAY 0-stars! "
rahul palace hotel ,"could be better If you want to stay at this hotel, do it qiuckly before it falls apart.We stayed there for 4 days while on holiday in India. Although the communal areas like the corridors and the restaurant are OK, the rooms are very disappointing. You will find that some rooms don't have windows. They are clean but in urgent need of redecoration. I mean things like door handles falling of, broken showers, missing taps. The windows look like they have not been washed forever, especially the ones in the bathrooms. The main problem we thought was the state of the electic sockets-they are completely exposed hanging of the walls and impossible to use. When we changed to another room, it was just as bad.Having said that the staff at the hotel were very helpful and understanding so if you only need to be there for a couple of days I guess its good enough just don't expect a lot. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Dreadful ""palace"" We stayed in this &quot;Palace&quot; in February 2005 for one night, although we had booked for three. The memory still scars me which is why I have to see what others have written about this whenever I log on to a travel website. The hotel is completely off the tourist map. Our taxi driver had to stop and ask direction 3 times before he finally found it.The bed was made but the aircon was broken, as was the fridge, and the bed linen looked dirty too. The area is very noisy so we didn't get much sleep.We paid £35/night through a well-known website which used to give the hotel 3 stars, and now gives it 2.5 stars. £35/night is way too much for this place. Having stayed one night, we checked out at 6.00am in the morning and moved to another hotel. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Real Delhi! Great food, great terrace, great service, really nice cold A/C, clean rooms, the building is a little run down, but beautiful with marble floors, and this is typical of Delhi. The room and linens are kept clean. The shower sometimes runs cold, but it's not too bad in a place as hot as India. A great location in a busy colourful shopping district. Lots of fun, and a great helpful travel desk. AMAZING SERVICE!!! "
rahul palace hotel ,Great place to stay! Very clean and friendly people. Food is great and always made fresh. No bugs and the staff are constantly cleaning. The hotel has a great location in the middle of the Karol Bagh markets and close to the Metro station. Air conditioned rooms and free internet service. If I returned to Delhi I would stay here again and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone else. 
rahul palace hotel ,people rahul hotel are very kind In this hotel i have found people very kind that have tryd to make our stay comfortableBernarda olianas 
rahul palace hotel ,"Awful Experience!! We contacted this hotel directly by phone and booked a room for 3 nights. We were told we would be picked up from the airport and driven to Hotel Rahul Palace, which was great because our flight arrived at 2:15am in a crazy city. No one ever showed up to claim us, we had to take a taxi to a phone to call the hotel and they claimed to have never heard of us or our reservation and they were currently full. They gave our room to another guest (probably for a larger amount of money) and left us stranded in a foreign city in the middle of the night. Shame on you Rahul Palace! "
rahul palace hotel ,Wonderful room great food and very friendly staff. The room was very nice. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the staff was very friendly. We very much enjoyed our stay.

rahul palace hotel ,"Avoid - worst place i stayed in India! This hotel is without doubt the worst place I stayed whilst in India - no hot water, and the room, bed and bathroom were all dirty. Another guest had money stolen from the safe whilst we were there, and we had a member of staff barge into our room without knocking whilst we were getting dressed for no reason. I was really glad to leave! "
rahul palace hotel ,"Bed Bugs Scummy Management Booked this hotel for a trip to Delhi through Expedia, do not believe what Expedia says about it. There is no pool, they will direct you to a nearby Public Pool, the sauna and steam room could not be located either... Although the rooms were advertised as suites the beds were only 6ft long (short for a European), and the rooms were of average standard- one of the two rooms we had had no window, and the a/c in both was very noisy. My bed had some sort of insects in it and I woke up with bites each morning. Bathrooms were ok, although hot and cold water was sporadic. The worst thing about the hotel however is the management, the two who staff the front-desk (one older guy, and a younger guy with glasses) were rude, obnoxious and grasping for any opportunity to make 10 Rs. more. On my check-in I was ignored, and the reception was generally unwelcoming. The hotel had no record of my reservation, although this could be Expedia's fault. The complimentary breakfast (in the reservation) was only grudgingly given following some discussion with the management.If you do stay there be warned that the map on their website is not very accurate and is difficult for taxis to find. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Truly Awful I strongly advice against staying here. The rooms were very basic given the cost. There was no hot water for the entire duration of our stay, despite staff claiming on several occasions that it would be fixed. They were also quite aggressive in trying to sell us an overpriced tour. We weren't particularly worried by this at the time and paid by credit card when we left only to discover when we got home that they had processed the payment twice!! "
rahul palace hotel ,"Good overall The hotel is clean, and the staff extremely friendly. Rooms are simple but quiet, and shower was quite good. Interesting location, though print out map and make sure you have the telephone number as some of my taxi drivers had trouble finding it (there are hundreds of hotels in this area). "
rahul palace hotel ,"Pleasant stay! I found Hotel Rahul Palace by luck through hotels.com. I was glad that it is located on the same street as many other hotels in a busy market district. The moment I arrived my luggage was delivered from the taxi into the lobby. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the moment I checked-in until I the day I checked-out. It was clean and well-kept. The front desk agents provided me with detailed information on how to get around the city. To my surprise not a lot of guests utilized the roof top restaurant. I found their selection of American and Indian food to be very affordable and tasty. Although internet was available for guest use, only one was working inconstantly. My only suggestion for the hotel is to provide more reliable computers. Overall, my stay was pleasant. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Rahul a badly managed ""dhaba"". I had been in contact with this hotel since three months regarding our stay at their hotel and also a trip of 10 days in Rajasthan.I exchanged mails with the administrative executive regarding our trip on a regular basis.Based on the mails I received I was getting the idea that this was going to be the best holiday I ever had even more because I was accompanied by my wife and daughter who were visiting India for the first time.The day of our arrival,time,pick up at the airport,our stay at Rahul while in Delhi ,our trip to Rajasthan starting from Delhi-Agra-Jaipur-Udaipur-Mt.Abu-Jodhpur-Bikaner-Mandewa-Delhi ,transport with a reliable driver,3 or 4 star hotels at all these places and our stay in Rahul for the rest of the days in Delhi before our departure from Delhi---these were all promised to me on paper and on the phone (I made the calls).The total price for the entire trip was calculated and I agreed.They promised us a qualis (jeep) to pick us up from the airport but a small indica (three adults and baggage) showed up.They promised us a triple occupancy presidential suite but what we got was a double room with a camping bed.Everytime we took a meal the waiter(s) would discourage us to charge to our room.They wanted us to pay in cash.I do pity the owner of this &quot;dhaba&quot;because his workers are literally stealing from his establishment.I HAVE PROOF OF THESE STATEMENT.I have already sent a mail to the hotel that I want to communicate with the owner directly.I also intend to send these things along with an offical complaint to ITDC,Min.of Tourism(india),Min.of Foreign affairs(Holland) and the Indian Embassy in The Hague.Evetually everything went WRONG from day 1.After 4 days in Delhi we were ready for our tour of Rajasthan--our means of transportation was changed (bigger car) we had to pay Rs.8000=00 extra.We were promised triple occupancy suits at all the above menyioned places.What we got were all double rooms without extra bed.In Jodhpur the driver brought us to a PG that is a Paying guest house instead of a hotel.***!!!!!!! Well finally our tour was over(thank god) and we came back to Rahul as pre-planned .Upon our arrival at the hotel they told us that we did NOT have a room.The room that we had booked 3 months ago was given away to somebody else.So we had to put all our baggage in a rickshaw and look for a hotel --all this after a very long and difficult drive from Mandewa.TO ALL FELLOW TOURISTS .PLEASE BE AWARE OF RAHUL HOTEL.I HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THIS DUMP.WAITERS AND THE RECEPTIONIST (CHEATS).YOU ARE WARNED.IF YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED,CHEATED,HARRASSED AND STOLEN FROM ===STAY AT RAHUL.If you wish proof of my statements mail me I will send you the names of the people you should be aware of in this dump.My trip was from 6 april--to--22 april.God were we happy to be back in Holland .

rahul palace hotel ,"Misleading Descriptions Beware do not stay here We recently stayed at this Hotel because of the description on a variety of websites. Dont waste your money there is no swimming pool, the air con tripped after 15secs of turning it on and the metal trip switch had to be turned on with a towel to avoid electrocution , the only window in the room looked out on to the stair well, no mini bar, taxes are not included if you pay directly to the hotel, the keys are not electronic, the towels are grey and linen had dubious stains, no free car parking (if you need to park then its out onto the street at your own risk) the elevator would not accomodate a wheel chair if you needed it. The travel desk / info consists of whoever is on the front desk that has a mate in a travel office (and there are a lot of them) who they call in to get their cut should you spend any money with them - complete sharks....! and this is after a long flight and taxi drivers with lost hotel syndrome who want to take you to their friends travel office to get you to book something so they get their cut too.....it goes on and on so you have to be on your toes....!

rahul palace hotel ,"First hotel in India We stayed at Was unpleasently suprised, but as we travelled around India started to realise this place wasnt as bad as it could be.Payed something stupid like £30 a night over the internet, DONT pay this much. You can get a much nicer hotel for less £££££ in a better locatoin.Agree with the rest of the reviews about dodgy staff, but youll meet plenty of the type if you stay in delhi for a while. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Dodgy staff rip-off merchants At ALL costs, avoid this Hotel if possible. Me and my friend stayed at this hotel for a total of 4 nights. It was the longest and worse 4 nights of my life. 1) Dodgy staff. 2) Lies. 3) Rip-off Merchants. 4) Over charged. 1) The staff at this dodgy propety are equally as sly as the rest of New Delhians BUT you expect differently considering you are paying for a service. As written on Expedia, the Hotel boasts free Internet. This IS correct but it comes at a LATER cost. When asking for internet at 9am, I was told that it wouldn't open until 10am and must wait. I had no problems with this. The next 30 minutes cost us $25 Australian Dollars. We went down windy streets only to find that we were going into a tourist shop. They wanted us to buy a tour but we weren't up for it. We finally were able to leave after using the internet . When arriving back at the hotel, the once nice lobby man gave us dirty looks. 2) When checking out of the hotel, we were charged for IDD calls to Thailand and China and un-used room service. (we assume it was because of us not purchasing any tours). DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL unless you ABSOLUTELY must/ enjoy getting ripped off. "
rahul palace hotel ,"I would rather stay in prison This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The window opened into a dark aircon vent, the room was filthy and the sheets had clearly not been washed. This is a waste of money, don't stay here. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Scammers ! Travellers beware ! ""Palace"" is an exaggeration 1 I spent one night at this hotel after seeing their website where the pictures are good. Finding the place was very tough. The taxidriver drove around these little lanes asking people where this hotel was ... nobody seemed to know it.They overcharged me for the room and the food. To make matters worse they took another 3% for credit card payment. The room was disgusting, the bed falling apart and the employees were totally useless. This place was a nightmare. Never again. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Clean. Safe. Decent location. Got a room for about $20/day through Expedia. Very clean room and bathroom. It felt safe - both the surrounding area and hotel itself where I kept my suitcases (ie, I didn't feel as though someone would steal my stuff). Bathroom with Western toilet and hot shower. They even gave me a free daily newspaper.Great service. My flight got delayed by one day. They still honored my prepaid reservation for the next day.Location is ok. About 10min by auto rickshaw from Connaught place. About 5min walk from their subway/train station. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Terrible Terrible. They cheated us with the room and give us another room, they charged for the water 10 times more than normal. Watch out, better keep away of this property! It is the worst hotel I´ve stayed in. Please beware. Bad neighborhood too far from everywhere, taxis don´t know the zone. The most awful 'hotel' we have ever seen. It was clear that the owners and staff had no training within the hotel trade and had no pride in the product they offered. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Nice Facility Terrible Management I recently spent a week at the Rahul Palace Hotel. The hotel itself is in good shape and in a reasonable location, but the awful staff prevent me from wanting to send any business in their direction.Things started off really badly. I had arranged to be picked up from the Domestic Terminal but my flight was delayed three hours so I was only somewhat surprised there was no one there to meet me. I called the hotel and they first suggested I take a taxi. I read about how difficult the place was to find and I wasn't completely comfortable taking a taxi by myself at 11 PM, so I told them to send a car to come get me like I had requested. They told me the driver would be there in 25 minutes. They also provided me with the driver's phone number. I called that too but it was the wrong number, so I had to call the hotel again. They then gave me the right number, but it was mostly useless as the driver hardly spoke English. I waited about 45 minutes and called both the driver and the hotel again. Both told me to wait a little longer and the guy was on his way. Several phone calls later we discovered the hotel sent the driver to the international terminal which is quite a distance away. In the end I waited 90 minutes and spend an obscene amount of money using my cell phone to call these people. The driver also managed to lose the ticket for the parking lot and spent several minutes arguing with the official at the gate. When I arrived at the hotel, the guy at the desk told me to pay the driver 600 rupees. When I made my reservation they quoted me a price of 450 rupees, so I was not liking the feeling of being scammed from the get-go. I refused to pay anything since I had to wait so long and spend so much money in phone calls. The guy at the desk said I should take it up with the manager in the morning.The manager, if that who he actually was, was entirely unsympathetic and found my situation rather humorous. I was unpleased and he didn't want to reimburse me for my airport pickup. Later when I asked them to call a taxi, they just used one of their own over-priced (I realized this later) cars to take me where I needed to go. They were clearly just interested in making money for themselves and not serving their customers' interests. When I had to go back to the airport two days later for my sister's arrival, I had the same terrible driver as the first time. The only positive experience from this trip was there was no charge for me riding along. The driver stopped for food on the way and only turned on the AC when I asked. At the airport he tried to get me to pay for him to enter the terminal, which I refused since it was completely unnecessary. Then he made me pay for the airport parking, which he said the hotel would reimburse. Back at the hotel, I gave the driver a 500 rupee note, wanting 50 rupees in change. He didn't have it so the hotel said they'd bring it up to my room, along with the 60 rupees for the parking. A few minutes later only the 50 rupees arrived. It took another try with the manager to get all my money back. These people are so frustrating!!As for the hotel itself, like I said, it's very nice. There is free, but slow internet in the basement. Beware, the power goes out frequently, which knocks out the computer. There is a generator, but you need to start all over again. The room was clean, the bathroom was decent, and the AC was powerful, though loud. The bed sheets looked clean, though had some holes and weren't really large enough for the bed. They put a single sheet length-wise across a double bed for some bizarre reason. We only got actual hot water once, but we didn't mind to much since it was so hot outside. The food from the restaurant was excellent and can be delivered to your room anytime of day or night for no charge! The neighborhood of the hotel is quite busy at all hours which made it feel safe, but without being noisy at all. The Karol Bagh metro station is about two blocks away and is an easier destination for taxis and autorickshaws once you know where the hotel is since it's on a narrow sidestreet that they can't seem to find.Basically, if you're hard up for a place to stay, Rahul Palace is great and the price (assuming they honor it) is good. I don't want to recommend them, however, because the service was awful and they seem to want to fleece their customers. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Not bad at all! I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as a single female traveller. I liked the place although it wasn't perfect. There was only warm water, not hot (not big deal, just don't run the cold one). I would prefer the towels bit more white instead of grey, but.... for the money I would stay there again. After all, I only spend there nights, was out all day everyday. I had one meal at the hotel's restaurant. It was good enough, but the service was a bit slow for my liking. Everybody at the hotel was nice and helpful, could smile a bit more though. "
rahul palace hotel ,"Not Worth the Money! This Hotel Provid Terrible Service I am writing this review as I made my decision to stay in this place based upon the review comments here. I am highly disappointed on the review comments in favor of Hotel Rahul Place, and I start suspecting if these review comments are REAL after staying in this hotel. I dont think it is Hotel! But a cheap motel, located in Karol Bagh a very busy business place.I would have not written this review, if I paid Rs500 for a night at hotel Rahul Palace, which i think is worth for stay. I paid $30 + Rs 700 to travel to and from the Airport to this so called 3 start facility. This pinch me a lot now. I should have not took a chance and shall have found a reasonable place to stay even though bit more expensive. If I would have known this before, i would have not spent on this place I spent almost $45 US (Hotel + Taxi. The worse thing was traveling in taxi for 3 hours from 12:30 AM to 3:30 AM after 23 hours of travel from USA to India to find the damn &quot;Rahul Palace&quot; I would have happily spent $145 to be safe and secure. I could not even take a shower with hot water.I started at 12:30 AM from the Airport took a paid taxi to the Rahul Palace on Main Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi. Driver drove on Main Ajmal Khan road for 20 minutes and could not find. Someone told us that we shall look for Rahul Palace in WEA, then we started looking for WEA arae, asked locals no one knew about the place “Hotel Rahul Palace”. It was scary place at night time, I thought I’ll be mugged. I lived in India but I was honestly scared as majority of the people we met were drunk and some were sleeping on the streets, cars, Rikhsa’s, may be a good place during day time but not at night. Especially if you are traveling with female I would not recommend this place at all, area wise. After a long struggle we found the damn “Rahul Place” which was very hidden inside the unplanned thickly populated urban area, where address does not mean anything to locate physically a facility, I am sure mail will not be a problem but for a stranger it is not easy. I don’t know why I spend so much time for $30 to find Rahul Palace, when I could have found better place to stay by spending another $30 in the same area, not i prefer this area. I saw some good places to stay near the airport, when i started the journy to Rahul Palace. Somehow hotel is not that famous as the “WEA” which I later found out is a showroom of same size a typical Seven Eleven about (3000 sqft). The idea is to tell you how misguiding the ranking could be when we try to search through the internet.Finally, I ended up at the motel and staff was OK, helpful, took my stuff to my room. Room was small, AC was making more noise than cooling the room, I had to turn on the fan to cool, TV was OK, and Hot Water was just dripping! Pressure of cold water was so slow I had to spend five minutes to properly drain ---- from the toilet!!!!! Bed sheets were sub grade as per hotel industry probably cleaned once a month and not fresh every time a new customer takes room! Hotel towels were soiled. I ended up using my persoanl towel which luckliy i took with me! Hot water was almost none existing and water pressure was terrible, took five minutes to fill one bucket to take shower with cold water! Forget about shower with hot water!!!Good thing was food, Hotel provided me Dal and Roti, which was decent and very quick. I was Hungary so food tasted very good! Relatively less noise on the street from street traffic as i was supsteing since room was alomst next to street. Staff Person at the reception desk in the morning was discourteous probably was son of the owner had &quot;do not care attitude&quot; I did not feel like I shall tell him to fix hot water. They did ask me to fill customer satisfaction form, which I did with &quot;no care attitude&quot; like the front desk person and tell them the in writing how terrible was the stay. Conclusion: I’ll not stay in the hotel in future, but would rather spend more money if required and find a reasonable place to live. I would not recommend this place for single women’s (especially westeren women) or even people with family especially if you are checking in at the middle of night. Typically all of us end up in Delhi around 10:00 Pm as most of the flights end up reaching Delhi around 10:00 PM.I disagreed with some of the previous review comments that place is good place to live per Indian Standards and value for money, I think Indian Standards have raisin a lot, especially when it comes to value for money spent. I don’t think it applies here, as I wrote before I would pay Rs 500 and stay a night at Rahul Palce and will not be feeling ripped off. I strongly suspect that the review comments about Hotel Rahul Palace are somehow manipulated by the Hotel Owners as they are more favorable than they shall be based upon my experience after staying one night. Also I think, India shall set up a standard system to know hotel ranking as we know that Best Western, Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn is economy, Super 8 Motel is double economy and Radisson, Hyatt, Marriot is luxury and places like Rahul palace are probably fit below motel and shall be considered super economy.Hope this helps! I was not thinking to write this I thought their will be more people like me looking for input to stay at reasonable price in return for reasonable service. I stayed in all type of Hotels from $30 to $490 per night as I travel a lot for business. I always try to find a reasonable priced night stays, even though my company have high upper limit, if I spend more than $400 per night stay then I have to write an explanation note, but still my expense will be approved. Hope this review will help your future stay in Delhi. I booked my hotel through “Hotel” and thought the place will be reasonable, so be careful with the big name Websites Marketing tools. Websites like Hoetl, Priceline, and Expedia do not inspect/check and approve facilities; you are at your own risk. My personal opinion is that chain hotels do check standards before they give them business name, in this case no names, like Rahul Palace ends up in comparison with others named hotels and we get illusions that they provide same or better service but they don’t.

ramada plaza new delhi ,"They'll treat you like a thief! My rooms were booked and paid for in advance when I got to the reception after an intensive security check of the car - visual inspection under the hood, under the body with a stick and mirror - and of ourselves with metal detectors, screening gate and physical inspection of body and hand bags. Check-in took about 15 minutes and they asked me for my credit card as a security deposit in case if I steal something from the hotel and run away without paying. (At least I interpreted this reason as the rooms were already paid for).The double occupancy room required careful physical maneuvering to get to the door from the bed - it's just tiny. The room had 3 telephones: 1 worked only as an intercom within the hotel, 1 was disconnected from mains and 1 I later discovered was wrongly connected to the &quot;data&quot; port and thus didn't work. A broken shower in the bathroom was eventually left unfixed after my 3 nights' stay and 3 complaints. They have no weighing scale in the entire shiny 4-star hotel to either weigh yourself or your luggage; and that was discovered after transferring the call from housekeeping to front desk to bell desk.Checkout took about 20 minutes even after having absolutely no pending bill. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Cheap but you get much less than what you pay. Having stayed at other hotels in India, I noted many unusual features at this hotel that looks quite good from outside.1. The lobby looks like a bad copy of a Las Vegas estate. It is a matter of taste, and you may even like it, but it was not my personal taste of a 4 star business hotel.2. The rooms are cramped, and have an odd shape. 3. The carpets are not clean and in places torn.4. The bathroom has no tub, and the shower area is basic at best.5. Be careful with furniture in the room, they are so delicate that they might just fall if you put luggage on top.6. The lifts are quite adequate. However there is no sign that a lift has arrived to a floor. If you are careful observing all 7-8 doors, you might actually miss it.Service horrors:1. Internet is pricey at 7 star hotel rates (even Indian ones). The speed barely compares to that of a dial up (if it works). Not good for a business trip.2. Same for printing. Obviously a rip-off.3. Had a red stain on the pillow. And it was not a paint. I guess change of laundry doesn't happen when guests change.4. Breakfast/lunch at the only restaurant takes infinite amount of time for any service. But there is plenty of staff around, and they seem to be either busy walking past you or busy chatting to each other.And I was not the only one who experienced these. My colleague on another floor had a similar experience.Bottom line: You get cheated and you are better off some place else. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"A child learning to walk! This hotel is all of 3 months old, in the words of its owner Ashok Mittal, and according to him, there are numerous teething problems. This is the good news, i.e. the owner is aware that there are teething problems and did not make excuses for the numerous flaws, gaffes, shortcomings that I experienced during my 4 nites. The bad news is that this was the old Ashok Yatri Hotel, a 2 star hotel owned and run by the Indian Government, and it still shows in the infrastructure and decor, inspite of the refurbishing and new management under Ramada.1. Front desk was chaotic and unorganized when I tried to check in at 3pm, supposedly a slow time. There were at least 5 individuals behind the front desk, but it was not clear what they were up to. Each of them was trying to help the 2 guests who were at the front desk, one trying to check in and one trying to check out. When my turn came 3 of them tried to check me in one after the other asking for the same information repeatedly. One of them checked me in, gave me my keys, and just as I was leaving informed me that I should wait in the lobby because my 'room was dirty'!2. I finally checked into a clean room, and being famished after a long low cost airline flight, and looked for the room service menu. There wasnt one. It took 3 individuals and 20 minutes to retreive one. There was no waste paper basket in the bathroom.3. Space was at a premium on the desk, and the single plug point had to be alternatedf between the kettle, the lamp, the laptop and the phone charger. Some of the mini bar items spilled over into the desk drawer.4. The plumbing is old, and each time one uses the faucet, the flush, the shower, there is a huge racket. On the last day when I was packing my stuff from the wardrobe, I noticed that some of the clothes were damp. Upon closer inspection it turned out that there was a leak from the vent in the wardrobe, and droplets were falling on the clothes.5. At breakfast on the first morning, there was a long line of guests waiting to be seated. It was clear that the hostess and the manager were not able to cope with this. They were asking guests to share tables. When I finally got my table, and I got up to get my breakfast and returned with my plate, my table was gone! The manager offered to seat me at another table, but I didnt want to take the risk!6. When I asked for the user name and password for internet access I was told to come to the business center to get it becuase it was 'insecure' to send it to my room. When I went to get it, I was told why did I bother to come to the business center, it would have been sent up! This process needs to be repeated each time you need to buy more time, since it cannot be done online!7. On the 2nd day when I retunrd to my room in the evening, I noticed that towels and napkins had been replaced but the dirty ones had been left in the sink and the shower!8. Used glasses, cups, spoons were not cleaned or replaced.9. My Wyndham Rewards number was not in the reservation when I checked in, and I gave it to them, and I was assured it would be input. Sure enough when I checked at the time of check out, it had still not made its way into the system!The good news is that the staff is young, inexperienced and untrained, but they are trying hard. The hotel is enjoying over 90% occupancy and the public areas and the staff are stretched to accomodate everyone. I think they will come out of this teething period. If you are willing to endure this until then, go ahead and stay here, if not, wait for a few weeks or months. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,Unless you are short of options you should choose this hotel I just spent two nights in this hotel as I was part of a meeting. The lobby and restaurant was clean with polite but extremely slow service. The rooms on the hand were tiny and the air condition blew smelly air. Maybe it was the smog outside The showers were great but with little towels. I paid almost $14/day for wireless but it never worked and I knew more about internet than the staff. Outside the hotel was dirty and in ruins but it is not their fault. If this is a four star hotel god help us with lower stars. 
ramada plaza new delhi ,"The worst hotel I have ever stayed in As previous reviews have stated on entering the hotel things seem ok, but once you start dealing with the staff things go down hill. Our first room was so small and smelly we had no choice but to upgrade not a cheap option. We eventually moved our cases ourselves as we needed to change to go out. We had to call reception everytime we wanted hot water as we couldn't get it to work ourselves. The toiletries were already used by previous occupants and in some cases there were none at all.Breafkast was always luke warm and only on occassion would you be offered a napkin this was actually someone's job. There were no facilities not even a place to sit outside very poor all round. Fortunately our Convention was next door in the Shangrila Hotel (which in hindsight we should have booked) so I was able to use the beautiful swimming pool , spa and resturaunt. When it came to paying our bill we were told we could only pay this in US dollars but when we stood our ground and insisted we wanted to pay in GBP lo and behold it turned out we could. The only way to get anything done in this hotel is to have a shout and still they will smile at you as if they are doing everything to make your stay a good one (believe me they don't). I would not recommend this establishment to anyone be it for business or pleasure. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Immensely disappointing - avoid We looked forward to luxury in New Delhi to end our holiday - and the lobby promised this in spades. However, the hotel is 'all fur coat and no knickers'. The room 'Deluxe King' was pokey, the staff unhelpful if not rude, and the restaurant underwhelming. It lacked facilities, was overpriced, and was a major disappointment. Look elsewhere. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Lousy Due to non availability of a Double room priced at Rs. 6500 (US$140), had to take a Suite for Rs. 11000 (US$240). The website states for a Suite, Internet (for a fee is not stated). The ambience and cleanliness of the Hotel starts in the Lobby and ends with the lifts. The extra addition to the room to make it a Suite is a round table and 3 chairs, for which to pay an extra US$100 is not worth the value. The carpets on the room floors are torn and dirty. In the room the remote for television could not be found, the room cleaner came and found it under the bed. From bathrooms personal toiletries were missing and used. The Jacuzzi would not stop, the shower would not work, my wife had to hold the plug to enable me to have a shower. The restaurant food was good but not warm, the buffet counter was not clean. An extremely bad experience. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Awful April 25, 2009.I was on a two week business trip to Delhi with a colleague and staying at a decent budget hotel in Karol Bagh. But due a serious plumbing issue at the hotel where the room got flooded we had to shift immediatly and got a excellent rate from a TA for the Ramada Plaza Hotel.The reception was lifeless. we were not even shown / escorted to our room. The receptionist told us to find our way to the room. The room itself was like a pigeon hole. We had asked for twin beded room and were alloted a single kingsize bed. After several calls and one hour of waiting we were taken to another room with twin beds. This room was so fithy &amp; dusty. The houskeeping supervisor came and apologised and got one of the boys to clean the room. The Bathroom was a mess. water clogged in the shower area as soon as you opened the shower / tap. We called the housekeeping but this time they did not attend our call. The fittings were all rusted. I actually took a shower in a puddle of water which was above my ankle.Infact when my colleague went for breakfast he overheard converstion of a senior person from the Travel Freternity who also faced the similar issue and he was yelling at the hotel manager for such a sub-standard hotel which they call a five star property. We immedeatly decided to check-out from the hotel. We had actually booked to stay for a week at the hotel and after we settled the bill for one nights stay the cashier asked us what was the reason for check-in out. The reception desk were not at all bothered to notice we were checking out in a day. In short we informed him and he tried to tell us he would speak to the manager on duty and sort out the matter. In fact he informed us that the hotel began operation in November 2008. I could'nt believe him. But we had decided to leave and nothing would convince us to stay back at the hotel. "
ramada plaza new delhi ,Very nice We stayed at Ramada Plaza for total of 3 nights while we were in New Delhi. This hotel is very nice and the rooms were very clean and modern. The food in the restaurant is also very good. There is high security at the entrance of the hotel where baggage is screened etc. 
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Nightmare at Ramada Plaza Delhi Just avoid this hotel by all means since you might get extremely disappointed and very poor level of service compared to the Shangri La and the Meridien which are true 5 star hotels just 5 minutes away from this bloody Ramada. Or just go there if you have no other choice, as it was my case on 17-20 January this year, but you will pay a lot of money and get only disappointments, poor attention, and even risky experiences. During my first night there, indeed, one staff very strongly opened the door and went into my room on 5 a.m. in the morning without asking for permission, announcing himself, and although the « do not disturb » light was on ! Not the end of dreadful experiences : again on 7.30 a.m. 3 Indian staff did the same and came into my room again before running away as I was starting to chase them ….If you look at the venue and facilities, it is nice, but this place should never become more than a 2 or maximum 3 star hotel. This is what you should be paying for at Ramada Plaza hotel of Delhi (max. 1000 Rpees per night – don’t pay more than that !!!)The breakfast room is tiny, and I advise not to take your breakfast during rush hours ! It is like central station in London on a Monday morning, but with so small space that the room is completely crowded, and you have to ask 5 times for anything. If you are in a hurry, just skip the breakfast or you will await your check until the evening. If you like bacon, go to the street corner and choose any other place for breakfast because Ramada doesnt serve bacon ! FINALLY VERY IMPORTANT:Don’t do any laundry also at the Ramada, they will give it back after a petrol wash which definitely ruin your clothes. That is what happened to my suit, which has now ended up in the rubbish bin.And to complete the picture of mediocrity, the staff is unprepared to improve your conditions of stay. They just don’t care about you and start laughing when you walk away from them, especially Dinesh who will only laugh at you and your problems ! "
ramada plaza new delhi ,"Comfort and relaxation I was brought to this hotel by Aeroflot, because they cancel our flight.

We wanted to stay in delhi only for the week and a day trip to agra. We were picked up on time, the reception even helped us to get the mishandled baggage. We impressed with their knowledge of English. We travelled delhi, agra and jaipur with their assistance. There hotels at all the places were excellent.

We paid 1500 Euros for the tour and came out but later realized that we paid almost the double for trip. My husband wanted to go back to France and said. India is all cheater. I told reception about this and they asked their manager to come. He helped us a lot and coved this cheater to give our money back; I must thank them for all their help.

raunak plaza ,"A Place Feel Welcome A very pleasant budget-priced hotel for the midrange traveller. It has a good location close to shopping streets, two minutes from the Karol Bagh metro train station; and is nestled in a quiet back street away from traffic noise. The rooms are comfortable and clean, with overhead fans and the obligatory air-conditioners (if only through-the-wall models). The staff are attentive and very accommodating, no doubt led in that example by Mr. Dua, the Raunak's avuncular hotel manager. He made me and my partner very welcome and did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I met the hotel owners who were similarly inclined toward their guests - in particular the very personable Pushpa, who went out of her way to organise our train journey around the North of India. She dedicated a good amount of time organising hotels and train bookings, ever mindful of our need to keep costs down. As a result, we had an adventurous whistle-stop tour, trouble-free thanks to her efforts. I would recommend the hotel to anyone, and both my partner and I thank all the staff for treating us like special guests. "

raunak plaza ,"Terrible expirience!!!! What ever happens, do not book this hotel. This is a terrible hotel and would never stay there again, even if it was free. We arrived at this hotel, which is set in one of the backstreets of Delhi. The location of this hotel was set in the middle of a local shopping complex, and the photos advertised did not at all reflect the hotel. The staff at Raunak Plaza, were what I could best describe as a amateurs and had no training in how to treat guests or run a hotel which made my wife feel really uncomfortable, they could hardly speak a word of English. The hotel is effectively still a building site. We booked on the basis that it was a new hotel, and all facitilies would be comfortable and clean. It was less than uncomfortable. The rooms were dirty with damp on the walls, and for a new hotel, the place was pretty much falling apart. The other problems were that due to the building work, and the surrounding area where the hotel was there was ton of Mosquitoes and constant noise day and night. We asked to change rooms 3 times, due to the fungi growing on the floor and walls, and the uncleaniness. The shower water flooded the entire bathroom.The hotel was advertised with a Rooftop Terrace and restaurant, when we arrived, this was still being built, the service advertised was not there. The hotel building work meant the drilling and the work started at 5am in the morning, and continued until 22.00pm at night. We ordered some coffee from room service whilst we were there, and once we finished drinking we asked the room service to come and collect it, they came, and took it out of our room, and left it outside our front door for the whole of the next day. Fly's were swarming the tray.The hot water in the hotel was non-exisitent. After a long flight, we wanted to have a shower and freshen up, but had to wait nearly 2 hours after constant complaining to reception and still had no hot water, so we ended up with cold showers. The very next day we decided to check out, we left at 6.30am, there was no hot water to have a shower in the morning. When checkout time came, we went downstairs to reception, and the staff were sleeping in the lobby of the hotel, there was nobody to serve us, and when we woke one of them up, he got out of his &quot;sleeping bag&quot;, and with a terrible appearence served our check out. We checked out after one day, and sacrifised the cost. Please check out our photos first. Many other guests in the hotel, which we spoke to voiced the same concerns. "

rockland inn ,"Not as bad as it sounds I stayed at the Rockland Inn for 2 nights in 2006. Seeing the reviews of some people though really surprise me, it wasn't THAT bad. I mean, in Indian standards, it was a decent hotel. Not the cleanest, there was a bathtub, but hot water doesnt last long. I stayed in an executive suite, and I mean for the money, it was a pretty bad deal, but overall I didn't see any bugs or dirt and it was pretty clean. The noise btw didnt bother me too much, i dont think i noticed it until some of you mentioned. I recommend the restaurant beside the hotel to the right? Sorry lol i forgot the name. Also girls, i wouldnt recommend walking alone. "
rockland inn ,"Not my preference Not my preference !!!Not a place to stay if you need a quiet sleep, the Hotel is located right next to a major road, the uninsulated wall typical in india certainly don't help either, worst of all, during my stay, I was woken up a few times by the telephone ringing from the room services desk, which situated right outside my room door. If you happen to get a room on the road side (major road - outer ring road) it'll be noisy so bring the ear plugs. Construction noise and music started at 7am and continued through 7pm...The room look rather old and not very clean, bed is hard and short, if you are more than 180cm, you need to sleep daigonally.I change the hotel after one night of stay (not sleep, as the constant noise from the traffic and the telephone just keep woken me up), and I would not recommand this hotel to any one. "
rockland inn ,"Pleasantly surprised I had read another review of the Rockland Inn before travelling and was apprehensive - I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find a hotel that bore no resemblance to the place described in that review. So this is to set the record straight. The room was stylishly furnished with an en-suite bathroom that was shining and spotless. The bed was very comfortable with crisp white bedding. Two windows gave out on to a busy road but the sound insulation was effective at keeping the noise out. A brand new TV had BBC World Service and CNN, along with dozens of Indian channels. The air conditioning and fan worked but were not necessary as Delhi in January is like Spring or Autumn in the UK. The lobby was also spacious, spotless and calm, and staff were unfailingly efficient and pleasant. The restaurant was fine too with a buffet selection of tasty Indian dishes for dinner, and a similar choice for breakfast (including porridge.)The only thing I could have done with was some decent coffee - it was pretty much like other coffees I had in Delhi, but an espresso machine would be a good investment in catering for European guests. "
rockland inn ,"Terrible place avoid at all cost Rockland Inn was definitely the most terrible place on my trip to India. I stayed there at the end of my journey, so I could compare the hotels.The place is not just dirty, it is DIRTY even by Indian standards: Dirty toilet, dirty linen, dirty towels.Furthermore, the hotel is located direct on a major highway, so the rooms facing the highway are terribly noisy. As I was aware of that, I asked for a room at the back side. This did not help at all: the ventilation system of the hotel is so noisy that I could not sleep without earplugs.That's not what you want in the night, do you?Although they promise &quot;24h running hot water&quot; on the web, it's simply not true: they have an electric boiler in every room with the capacity of at most 5 minutes of hot shower.Unfortunately, my room was payed in advance, otherwise I would not have stayed in such a DIRTY place for more than 5 minutes.AVOID! "
samrat hotel ,"Slumps have better rooms than this. The pen ultimate disaster. Want to know what happens after 2012, come to this hotel. Staff were rude and were making snide remarks as we were checking in. Down right insulting us in our face. When giving them my platinum credit card, the staff accused me of trying to pass them a debit card. Carpet was threadbare. Damp musky stink. As we were walking to our room, we could see rooms with broken windows through open and broken doors. Air con was not working in the room. Staff who promised to help us look into it never came. We must have been talking to a ghost from this hotel's past. everybody wants a tip even when they are asked to repair broken fixtures in the room. Ultimate insult was when I was locked inside my room because the cheapskate lock they installed on the door failed, TWICE. Had there been an emergency or fire I'd be dead. When i asked to change my room, one rude man asked me menacingly if i wanted to change room. After changing the room through my insistence, he had the gall to try to cop a tip out of me. Worst hotel I had ever stayed in, you couldn't pay me enough to come back here. The one bright spark was a 46 inch LCD tv inside a small room. The money could have been better spent updating the fixtures and broken appliances or better yet, staff training. to think that my business associate booked me into this hotel thinking that anyone as prices of their rooms are at 5 stars rate, it should be good. Put your clients here only if you want to see them for the last time. Free internet was @ 2 kbps when it is good. DO NOT COME ANYWHERE NEAR THIS DUMP, EVER. "
samrat hotel ,"Sad hotel in disrepair I had stayed at the Samrat more than 20 years back &amp; the property has fallen into a terrible state now. Like most ITDC hotels, it is poorly maintained (unlike the Ashok next door, which is their flagship &amp; better maintained).The Wifi in the room would not work &amp; I had no internet access (which was free if it worked) They tried to fix it for two days but could not. The staff tried their best (which you expect at Rs 9000 a night) but to no avail. The hotel itself has a lot of corridors and is oddly designed. The carpets are worn &amp; corridors smelly &amp; damp. The room service was very slow although the food was not bad.The staff are helpful. There is a very live discotheque in the basement. But the overall ambience is not worth what you pay for. "
samrat hotel ,very bad experience I stayed at samrat to attend a conference. this hotel has got a good property but being government one it does not have good services. waiters does not listen. rooms does not get cleaned properly. not courtsey amongst the staff. if you order something from your room. forget it you would get it next day. i had a very bad experience staying at this hotel. 
samrat hotel ,"A little bit of love for the Samrat... Ok, it's probably appropriate to give just a little bit of – if not love then at least kinder ambivalence to the Samrat. I was booked at the Samrat for a business conference being held at the Hyatt. Since I had no control over where i was being booked I was pretty bummed and frightened to read the reviews on here. And in all honesty, the Samrat is not a great hotel by any means. But I found the reviews to be a little bit exaggerated. a) I’ve never been to India before so I can’t compare this hotel with anything other than the Hyatt.b) The Samrat simply isn’t in the same universe as the Hyatt but it was less than half the price so that has to be taken into account. They Hyatt is a very nice hotel by western standards. The Samrat would not be but I’m not sure how it compares to other Indian hotels in Delhi. c) After the Mumbai tragedy it was actually a bit of relief to not be staying at such a high profile western hotel. d) Someone told me the Samrat is a state run hotel. If so, this explains a lot.e) The hotel is pretty bedraggled. About the best way to put it. Things are kind of shabby and run down. That being said, I certainly didn’t see any rats and my room was fine. f) I personally found the staff to be warm, friendly and very accommodating. A few examples. I asked one morning if they had an English newspaper and the individual literally ran to get me one. Without asking he had the paper delivered to my room every morning and sought me out in the lobby one morning to make sure I was getting it. I also accidentally locked some valuables in the room safe and could not remember the combination. The manger was up in a flash to help. Everyone I ran into seemed very willing to accommodate. Requests to get a cab were handled quickly and with a sense of urgency. The room was cleaned impeccably every day. g) Free internet was not incredibly fast but it was free. h) My room had been refurbished and was in fairly good shape. It had wood floors which was a nice touch and a huge flat screen TV that I never turned on. i) In general the hotel is being “refurbished” but not in the manner I would be used to. In the US you would bring in a professional crew and plow through an organized rehab with a strict methodology and timescale. At the Samrat it appeared as if random crews of disorganized individuals are working at various tasks. I saw people repairing plaster in one area only to disappear without a trace with the job seemingly half finished. Perhaps this is common. j) I thought they had a nice buffet in the morning.k) Every night there were weddings in the courtyard which frankly I thought was kind of cool.l) I did have to try to get to sleep one night through the thumping base beat of the disco but other than that one night the hotel was reasonably quiet. m) I traveled about a week or so after the tragedy at Mumbai. The security at the Samrat seemed very tight. People were taking their job seriously which I really appreciated. If anyone from the Samrat reads this review I hope you’ll agree this is a fair review. I would only offer you this advice. You can make great strides by focusing singularly on customer service. Doing everything in your power to ensure that every staff member and every employee does everything they possibly can to make every guest’s visit an enjoyable, safe and productive one costs very little money. Your staff seems to understand this but you need to continue to reinforce this from the very top! If you’re curious you should study up on the philosophy of the Wynn hotels or the W hotel chain. Oh… and replace the carpeting. It’s really gross. "
samrat hotel ,hotel samrat hotel samrat which is situated in chanakya puri(south ex.) ned delhi has all the facities one lokks into before booking a stay in a hotel. its two very famous lounges named headquarters and decibels are a perfect place for those who wanna shake a leg after their days rest in their luxurious rooms. even the rail shaped bar provides you with every drink you can think of.its perfect for an outstay. 
samrat hotel ,"Worse than ever it seems!! I stayed at Hotel Samrat more than 5 years ago ; it was awful then and ,remarkably, seems to have become much worse now. I say &quot;remarkable&quot; because Delhi has improved so much as a city in recent times and there are so many guest-houses and the like available, if one is not inclined to pay the exorbitant 5-star hotel rates. But why would anyone pay good money for the mess that is the Samrat. Surely, the Indian or Delhi tourist authorities should take action. "
samrat hotel ,"It was not really good! The hotel is very old and currently undergoing renovation. Construction sites are all over the place. Cables hanging out lose, water lines, cockroaches running around the bath room....The staff is unmotivated and non-emotional. The rooms are mostly okay. Breakfast buffet is very limited and really no pleasure. For business travellers I do not recommend this hotel. "
samrat hotel ,simply !!!Worst!!! DO NOT WAISTE YOUR MONEY TO STAY THERE.DIRTY - I'm really sorry that have not make a picture... You'd amaize...NOISY - DISCO in a hotel finish at 3 a.m. - no chance to sleep!FOOD IS REALLY POOR and BAD QUALITYKitchen is dirty.LOCATION is bad - nothing to go around.The worst Moscow 2 stars hotel would be better then this 4! 
samrat hotel ,"SamRAT lives up to name We stayed here reluctantly (having read TripAdvisor reviews) because it was part of a conference package. It certainly lived up to those reviews and its name the SamRAT, as there were rats!This is a government run hotel and will need to improve markedly if it is going to be ready for the C'wealth Games in 2010. Directly next door is another government run hotel, Ashtok, which was genuinely 5 star. The SamRAT was being belatedly renovated in some areas and there was an excellent privately run restaurant and bar on the ground floor but this was not advertised and difficult to 'happen upon'. "
samrat hotel ,"Worst Hotel I've Ever Stayed IN Do NOT stay here. This is a government run hell-hole. I travelled to New Delhi for a friends wedding and this hotel was recommended by the family of the bride so we assumed it would be ok. However the hotel stank of damp, the room was filthy and had cockroaches, the staff were rude and demanded tips, I became violently ill after staying here. A friend staying at the same time saw a rat run across the breakfast room. Avoid!!!!! "
samrat hotel ,Rat house would be a more apt name It was very run down and smelly! Even though they said we had the updated rooms. The hotel is government owned and they sould be ashamed of it's condition. 
samrat hotel ,"A rip off Far too expensive for what you get. The price is really only for the downtown location. Run-down room and hardly any facilities. But at least the room was tidy, quiet and not dusty or smelly. "
samrat hotel ,"Avoid the Smarat!! Just came back from a two week trip in India which includedfive nights (pre-paid) at the Samrat. It was the most expnesiveand the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip. If it had notbeen pre-paid, and close to where I had a meeting, we wouldhave checked out after the first night. I wish I had read thereviews posted here before I went. The staff was unhelpful,unknowlegable, and rude. The first room we were in hadan overwhelming smell of pesticide and there were stillcoackroaches. We moved to a room without carpets, whichreduced the smell. The linens were dirty, towels missing. Whenwe asked for clean towels we got somewhat less dirty onesand the usual expectation of a tip for bringing what shouldhave been normally provided. We had a dispute over one ofthe pre-paid nights and the cashier wanted to keep the receiptI had of our payment. I said he could kieep it but should giveme a photo-copy. That request was met with disbelief, becausethey said they had no copier or any possible way of making a copy. For a supposedly multi-star hotel in Delhi in 2006, that seemedvery backwards. The ``gardens&quot; and fountains that one sees on the internet were all closed. The breakfast included in the room rate was unedible, and we ended up not eating there after our first breakfast, eating breakfast instead at the Ashok across the way (a very expensive breakfast - showing how awful the Samrat foot was). The worst part of this hotel is thatit has a nightclub called the Decibel (that says it all) that blastedthumping music late into the night (one night until 3am) on four ofthe five nights we were there. For callibration, I should mentionthat I have travelled extensively in India, and lived for there forextended periods in the past. I have stayed in worse 5 dollara night hotels in India than the Samrat, but also better 5 dollar a nighthotels than the Samrat. For a western-priced hotel, the Samratis absolutely the worst hotel I have seen. Under no circumatancesshould one stay there. The only positive point is that it doeshave a nice new resteraunt called the Chakras. But the hotelhas no directory of services in the room and the registationstaff didn't mention anything about hotel facilities, so we onlyfound it late in our stay. I really pains me to write such a negative review, because I want to encourage tourists tovisit India, and I hate to sound like a spoiled westerner.We hada wonderful trip overall, and India is a fantastic place to visit. But I have enough experience in India to know that theSamrat does not represent India and really deserves to be avoided - and to be put out of business by the many better,and more affordable hotels. Come to India, but avoid the Samrat!!. "
samrat hotel ,"What a dump!! Quite how this passes for a 5* hotel I do not know. The whole place was filthy and looked to be falling down in places. The decor in the corridors is awful and smelly. The first room we had there were holes in the ceiling with loose electrical wires hanging out, the bedding was smelly and full of holes, most of the facilities in the room did not work and we had cockroaches in the bathroom. After complaining loudly we got moved to a marginally better room but it was still no where near the 5*s it claimed to be, though we did have a lovely view of the algae infested swimming pool. The one saving grace was the independently run Chinese restaurant on the ground floor which, strangely enough was superb. "
samrat hotel ,"Third rate hotel at the five star price Designating Hotel Samrat a five star hotel looks to me a big joke. I stayed there in October 2006 and it is a dirty and unkept .Bathroom leaked, torn mattresses, dirty carpets, holes in walls etc. Baradari restaurant is horrible too. Many waiters but hardly any service they provide. Food was Ok but meats were undercooked.Many managers are there just seeking bribes or tips. When I checked in they told me that hotel is available only for one night and I have to check out tomorrow. After checking in, the duty manager approached me that he will work out something tomorrow and advised me not to checkout. My reading was that he was looking for something. After two three hours he called my room to ask me that I should come down to meet him because he is alone at this time. Hence, a big tip was given... Moreover, someone entered our room and stole 1.6 lakh rupees along with 210 US dollars and a checkbook. It happened when we went for a dinner in hotel restaurant called Baradari. The friendly manager knew our plans for dinner time (when and where), the same man who let us stay for another night. In conclusion, don't stay in this unsafe and a rat hole. "
samrat hotel ,"Horrified. Our first choice hotels were booked up, so our driver took us here. What a mistake 7500 INR for a dump. We left after seeing the room, the 4 alternatives offered were just as bad. Everything the other reviewers mentioned are still the same, bare wires, grey sheets, stained worn carpets, baths that were disgusting. The corridoor walls were horrible. I was prepared to sleep in the airport rather than stay here. Awful, awful, awful.We left and checked into The Hyatt - worth every penny. "
samrat hotel ,"Don't stay at the Samrat Do not stay at this hotel. For a start, it's only partly a hotel. The upper floors, and part of the 1st floor where there are guest rooms, are obscure Government office eg Telephone disputes Tribunal, Ministry of Forests etc. The rooms are Ok if a bit down at heel, but the corridors are shabby with junk piled up on the staircases. The pool was 'closed' in high season, and the gardens scruffy with no chairs etc. Breakfast in the Red Chilli restaurant was poor, dismal decor and limited food, which ran out. No way is this a 5 star hotel.The hotel appears to make its money from a nightclub which belts out incredibly noisy music at least one night a week so that you can't sleep. When the nighclub is closed, the restaurant may be let out for equally noisy parties. We had to move rooms at midnight.Curiously, there is a rather good new restaurant on the hotel premises, stylish, modern and a good menu, if almost no customers. [Not the Red Chilli] "
samrat hotel ,"A complete dump This is the worst hotel I and my family have ever stayed in. Grey sheets, bare wires inserted into electric sockets. It's not only dirty, it's simply not safe. The entrance is nice, but a complete facade! You will be shocked to see the state of the rooms. They have 4 bell boys who don't have much to do for most of the time - it's a pity they couldn't give one of them a paint brush to start redecorating the bedrooms. I would never stay in an Ashok property again. The rooms aren't cheap either, I can't believe that it gets away with masquerading as a 4 star hotel. "
samrat hotel ,"Hell Hole As a frequent traveller I was completed dissappointed with this hotel. From the start the service was appalling. The car I booked to collect me from the Airport never turned up. When I checked in there was no apology or offer to credit the charge. They also were confused and tried to charge me twice even though I had paid e-globe on-line. The foyer was being sandblasted all week and the rest of the hotel was completed dilapidated, musty with regular power cuts. I had cockroaches in my room and the so-called drinking water was in broken sealed out-of-date bottles with the labels torn off. It was my Birthday on the 13th and when I went to the bar to buy a celebration beer, I was told they had run out of stock! There was no Internet or business meeting rooms to hold meetings.In brief, every aspect of the service, facilities and accomodation was the worst standard I ever experienced. It was a short stay and only because I had pre-arranged meetings, I'd have checked out the following day.How they can claim 5 star is totally bewildering. "
samrat hotel ,"Checked out after 30 minutes We had booked for 2 nights at Hotel Samrat through a travel agent as it was closer to the US Consulate.We drove back from Jaipur Thursday evening (30th June, 2005) and checked into Hotel Samrat. We went to the reception and checked in. We took an elevator to the 4th floor and had to walk past smoke filled government offices to our room. As soon as we entered it was one of the worst rooms i had ever seen in my life filled with cigarette smoke eventhough it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. We tried another room in 3rd floor which was of similar condition. Then we were told that we will get another newly renovated room and as soon as we entered this room we could smell the paint.That was it!. We could not take it anymore and talked to the manager that we wanted to check out. So there it was. The shortest checkout!.Also i wanted to get a copy of the cancellation confirmation and the manager was rude saying that they wont give us the copy. She said we could complain to anyone we wanted and she didn't care.So Please skip any of the &quot;TheAshokGroup&quot; properties. PLEASE! "
samrat hotel ,"Give it a miss! An impressive entrance and that's where it ends. Musty, old and bare rooms requiring complete renovation. There isn't a mini bar, tea/coffee facilities or trouser press as advertised. Staff totally unhelpful at reception. Give it a miss!!!! "
samrat hotel ,"If you like cockroaches Under the guise of a five star hotel, the Samrat operates a dirty, dank and horrible place to stay in Delhi. I live in India and travel a lot for business so I know that this is much worse than the typical problems encountered with accomadations in India.It was shabby, old and run down. It did not have internet and the staff did not provide any tips on how one could access internet in the area. The staff were not friendly or helpful. And there were cockroaches in my room...two days in a row! The staff or manager never once apologized for the inconvenience or offered any compensation for my trouble. This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Don't Do It After having been impressed at all other Shangri-La's, this hotel really let us down. The worst part of our stay was the check-out process. We booked the IHGF rate in advance that is arranged through the EPCH who organize this fair. They confirmed in writing it was $6500 + $1300 tax per night. Upon checkout the tax had gone up to $1700. Over several nights this adds up. Their first explanation was that the tax rate had changed during our stay. The story then quickly changed to the fact that we had actually been upgraded without knowing and that the tax on the upgraded room was different. They refused to credit us the difference. We were also charged for several mini bar items that we did not consume and items that were consumed had different pricing than shown in the room. When we questioned this they just shrugged their shoulders. We refused to sign the credit card slip until it had been adjusted. We waited 45 minutes for a manager to arrive, but had to leave or we were going to miss our flight. We received our visa statement today and they put through the whole amount without a signature. I would think perhaps this was an isolated mistake, but at the same time there were two other couples disputing the room charges that had been put through. All three of us had the emails confirming the rates, but they couldn't even be bothered to look at them. Other beefs - The rooms are definitely not Shangri-La level. I think this is due to the fact that it was taken over by them in the recent past. They wanted to charge us a full nights rate for checking in 2 hours before their allowed 8am check-in although they repeatedly told us that there were many rooms available. They eventually gave in to half, but it required much debate. This is not how you should be treating customers that will inevitably be spending much more on wine and food then the rooms themselves. You can see from our many other reviews that we are generally quite satisfied by most hotels, but this one was honestly a rash. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Calm efficient 5 star in busy Delhi We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip to India; on arrival 2 nights in a premium room and 3 nights prior to departure in a deluxe Horizon Club room.The hotel is run as a business rather than tourist hotel and the break from elaborate welcomes and an emphasis on quiet efficiency was just what we wanted. It also meant the tourist type facilities, such as spa, pool, gym were not busy.Airport transfers were efficient. Both rooms were comfortable although the Horizon Club room had much quieter air-con. Both had good beds, crisp linen and sparkling clean bathrooms.The pool area is a very pleasant haven from the city – just lie back and listen to the incessant car horns! The spa treatments were good, again with an emphasis on delivering a quality product rather than creating a mystical experience, which suited us fine.A previous reviewer mentions views of traffic; probably inevitable in a tower hotel in the centre of a city dominated by traffic. We found the view of the traffic jams quite relaxing as we gazed down on them from the 19th floor enjoying our free drinks in the Horizon Club.We found the breakfast and service good and the position in New Delhi very convenient. We have no complaints and our stay was as good as we expected; just what we wanted at the beginning and end of our holiday. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Good location The location is very good, you can walk to the Patel Chouk metro stop which is about 200m away.Check in was very efficient as was the daily housekeeping service. There is reassuring security at the gate.The concierge service was excellent - they booked us train tickets to Agra which were waiting for us when we arrived. Taxis arrive within a few minutes of being called.The room was fine - quite large with a seating area; bathroom had good quality toiletries and a nice shower. Bed was comfortable.Breakfast buffet was excellent - a good selection; likewise at dinner.The hotel has well kept gardens and a great pool (not enough loungers though).I paid INR 8,900 which I regard asquite expensive but was still better value than some other central 5* hotels in Delhi. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Solitude from the intensity of New Delhi Behind the gates of the Shangri-La there is solitude, well almost, from the buzz, horns and utter chaos of New Delhi. The hotel has a good location overlooking some of the monumental historic buildings and parkways of Delhi. Its a tower block, operated under a Shangri-La franchise. Inside the rooms are spacious and as you would expect from Shangri-La, with an air of needing refreshing and updating. The public rooms and bars downstairs are in perfect order with good access to the well loved gardens. The food is excellent all round and service generally good - but some lack of attention and unfullfilled promises by behind the counter staff at carvery on a couple of occasions. Fine wines (pricey of course) and fine service in the Executive Lounge with attentive staff with great views from the top of the building. With the current more than usual chaos as roads are being carved up for the new metro and Commonwealth Games I recommend you insist on leaving the hotel an additional hour before the time you had in mind to get to the airport. Thanks to the staff and management for their welcome. Its a place I feel confident to recommend. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"The Shangri-Blah: A Complete Rip Off Why pay $300 a night for a hotel which offers mediocre service, cramped rooms, subpar dinners and lunches, and views of roads and traffic? I chose this hotel for our last two nights in Delhi as a splurge, and was sorely disappointed. In other hotels (cheaper, and much nicer), we were greeted with drinks, warm welcomes... but at the Shangri-La, no such thing. The hotel is a large chain hotel that is relying on the laurels of its name, not its reality. To make matters worse, we missed a connecting flight and had to change our itinerary, but the hotel would not refund us the one night that we couldn't make it, nor did they offer upgrades, or meals (or even apologies!) to make up for the $300 we lost. We will never stay in a Shangri-La again. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Sanctuary from the hustle and bustle After a full day of wandering around Delhi, it is a pleasure to walk into the beautiful and highly air conditioned lobby of the Shangri La. The flowers in the lobby are amazing! The staff is great, security is very tight and the rooms are spaceous and clean. Internet was complementary in the rooms which is a perk too. The breakfast buffet is varied and delicious, particularly the exotic fruits. There is a funny peep window in the shower that my husband found amuzing, but they do provide a curtain for privacy, so its more a quirk than a complaint. Oh, and they sent me cake and flowers on my birthday! Overall, a great choice! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Used the Pool and Health Facilities while in Transit One Day -- Treated like I was a 5 star Customer I paid to use the hotel pool and spa (about $10 on weekdays; $20 on weekends) for the day because I had 12 hours of transit through Delhi. As a frequent traveler, I've done this in other cities but it always causes a hassle and is often not worth it. It's also really hard to find a hotel that allows you to do this in Delhi. The service at the Shangri-La was impeccable however, even though I was only a day-use customer. They were incredibly helpful and welcoming. The pool and health facilities were all you could ask for, with the spa, sauna, relaxation room, and jacuzzi all particularly wonderful for a passing traveler. Will definitely stay here the next time I pass through Delhi for real. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,perfect hotel this hotel is another excellent property. the location in delhi is unbeatable and the landscaping outside the hotel is great. the hotel itself has a chic style which is associated with the shangri-la group. stayed there for 3 days and got a free upgrade. avoid booking car through the hotels they overcharge but if u wanna travel in style the use their bmw's. the rooms are perfect. nothing to complain. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Amazing hotel This is a great luxury hotel. They pamper you. I was very impressed with the service. I am very selective when it comes to sushi, the Japanese restaurant was decent (not the best). "

Hotel is spotless, Food- excellent, Surroundings lovely, Was very hot whilst our stay their at least in the 40's. Very polite staff, you must also check out the Shangri La spa also, the treatments are fantastic. The Cafe Uno 2 go does some of the best cakes I have tasted and not over priced either. You are made to feel very welcome and nothing is to much trouble. Was greeted on arrival at the airport with a lovely car, check in superb, we ordered room service at 2am which wasn't any trouble at all. Free internet access. Would love to visit the Shangri la again. "

I was on a buiness visit and so only spent the night at the hotel. The rates seem to be high but if you can afford it, it is one of the best places to stay in Delhi. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,marvelous food room and service The room was outstanding. The food was simply stunningly marvelous--I could live there! The service was amazing.I can understand why the price is so high--they have so many people standing around. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Loved the Room with aView The hotel is well renowned for its services and attention to guests. The swimming pool is the best maintained with an emergency trainer available round the clock. The Spa and massage facilitie are the best in their class. The rooms are so well designed that each has a balcony overlooking the landmark INDIA GATE and the Raj Path. The early morning jog in this place makes you ooze with energy and the spirit in you soars to achieve more right through the day. The Business Centre is amongst the most well equipped in the National Capital Region and the variety of food on offer here is exquisite and the taste impeccable. The chef's remember even the quantum of heat to be applied to say a saute` or the sauce to accompany a salad made with fresh himalayan vegetables and fine virgin olive oil. The cabs and drivers in service are the smoothest drivers in Delhi despite the chaos that prevails in the Capital City.Thanks Shangri La for the memorable stay during PrintPack India Exhibition in Pragati Maidan. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Convenient Shangri-la is conveniently located within reach of all the business,shopping financial and Govt establishments.

shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Elegant Comfort This hotel always make me feel, something is extra and unique, may be its services. Initially I was not very much aware of it; eventually I fall in love with their services and comfort. After work it is very relaxing and comfortable. Their food is really good in town. It starts from the pick-up from airport till I drop finally at airport for departure; they are always ready to serve you the most. I asked for in room safety box service, because the previous guest left it locked. Within minute service made me really glad. Restaurant, Swimming Pool, Concierge and room comfort are really good and healthy. I always recommend my friends to stay there for the luxurious comfort in town. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"luxurious room This hotel is classy all over and you can tell the moment you arrive at the heavily secured gates. The first thing you see is a Rolls Royce car showroom.The lobby is warm, sumptuous and attractive with very slick and seamless check-in in our room. The room was very well appointed with bathtub view of the whole room and very tasteful, yet functional furnishings.The only minus point is the expensive coffee shop. Buffet dinner is Rs 1,600 plus plus (12.5% luxury tax etc.). "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Amaazing place to stay if you can afford it Amazing place to stay in Delhi, ie if you can afford it. I stayed in a room with a breathtaking view of the India Gate. A hotel with very comfortable interiors and very good service, they serve a good variety of Indian delicacies as well - good place to take your client / business associate who is traveling to Delhi. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,amazing food brilliant place to stay in delhi near business district 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Luxury in convenient location Located right in the heart of South Delhi, just next to Connaught Place, this was a government run hotel. Under new private management of the Shangri-La group of hotels, it has completely transformed! All the amenities of a good 5 star hotel plus the great location make it THE place to stay when in Delhi. Food could see some more variety but other than that, I would give this hotel full marks. After all, great food is right outside your door step in CP! Otherwise, excellent ambience and service, lovely rooms. The hotel is not cheap and understandably so. Therefore, not for the budget traveller. "

shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Shangri-La tea time We did not stay at this hotel, but we went in there for late night coffee and spend 3 hours. Our flight was 5am so we stayed there 11pm to 2am. This the best and safest place around Janpath and Connaugh Place to be at that hour.The lobby bar is closed at 11pm. But their coffee shop which is the main restaurant as well open 24 hours. Good service. They had an open buffet which was closed when we arrived at 11pm. The food was still there, they had a large dessert open buffet which we weren't allowed to purchase anything at all. They told us, they can not serve us from that buffet and these food will go garbage!! Nonsense. We had lemon cheesecake which wasn't good due unfortunatly India not being able to produce good cheese. I had a chochlate tart and rose tea which was great!They won't exchange usd if you are not staying in their hotels.The service was good. Our driver was directed to a parking lot. He waited for us in the car. Very clean and fancy looking hotel.Overall it was nice but Indian operations side of the business was lowering their standart. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,dissappointment We stayed at the Shangri-La over Christmas and although we loved the snazzy room we found the atmosphere a rather cold and impersonal. The service wasn't stellar either. On arrival the porter brought us the wrong suitcase and just laughed it off and told us not to worry. Later we sat in the almost empty lobby cafe for at least 30 minutes before eventually having to get up to request menus. The staff seemed embarassed only after she realised we were guests. Room service was excellent but again the service was slow. These kind of things just shouldn't happen in a 5 star hotel. We went to stay at Shangi-La on our way back through Delhi less than 2 weeks later and found that they'd raised the nightly rates by almost 25%. Strange considering the times. We ended up choosing LaLit for our last few nights in Delhi and much preferred it. Way better experience &amp; way better value. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Overpriced I chose this hotel as I had stayed in the Shanrilas in Thailand, Malayasia and Dubai. However the standard was completely different. The security was, as a previous reviewer wrote, heavy handed. Getting in or out of the hotel was an ordeal. However my main gripe was the value for money. The reception staff were discourteous and everthing seemed to be a burden for them; the conceirge staff told me that I shouldn't take a local taxi to a resteraunt one evening as it was not safe. They pressurised us to use their car which turned out to be 20 times the normal taxi fare. The new years eve meal was around $400. I am sure there is better value elsewhere in Delhi and I could not recommend this hotel. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"PoorValue for Money not a five star in reality!!!! Prior to arriving here other travellers we met on the Dehli Circuit told us it was a poor show compaired to a Taj stay!!! How right they were!!! The room was far from pristine, lots of dust, some glass marks, stained furnishing, that type of thing!! However bedding fine but still!!! Horrible security check really aggressive felt like the help not guests!! Dinner the most expensive in Dehli but tasted very average. Service poor apart from one lovely server, which is pretty bad when you consider we spent two days there! You only got attention from waiting staff if you are one of those demanding aggressive types!! Premium added onto the drinks, which your not advised about till you get the bill!! Save your money and DONT PAY 5 STAR PRICE FOR A VERY DULL 3 STAR!!! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Mediocre Shangri-la Stayed 4 nights at this Hotel.Noisy on the Floors.Small Horizon Club Rooms.Good in the Horizon Club Lounge,but poor selection for BF and Cocktail Hour.Not a Shangri-la asn in other cities in Asia.Had much better experience in India with Taj or Oberoi. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Superb Hotel - Excellent standards From the very first minute our stay in the Shangri-La was absolutely superb.The bedrooms are exceptionally clean, beautifully decorated &amp; extremely comfortable. We ate in two of the restaurants. Firstly lunch outside was superb &amp; then Dinner in the second floor Thai/Chinese/Japanese restaurant was sublime. They have three individual open kitchens &amp; you can choose from any three of the menus. We tried food off each menu &amp; they were all excellent.All in all a fantastic Hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Not bad The Shangri La is a fairly nice hotel. I stayed there two different times for three nights total and both rooms were excellent. Good beds, nice bathrooms, no major complaints. The buffet breakfast was adequate. Nowhere near as good as the other Shangri Las that I've stayed, but it's India so the selection won't compare to other places. The service was decent at both breakfast and dinner. My major complaint: nickel and diming. We're already paying over $450/night for the room. Is it really necessary to charge excessive fees for airport transport, as another reviewer noted? Or $20+ a day for internet? That's the second highest rate I've found anywhere in the world, and the $20 wasn't per room - it was per computer. We had two computers and, after talking to the business center, determined that if we tried to switch the ethernet connection between the two to download emails, we would be charged twice - $40 per day! Ridiculous. Come on Shangri La, for $450/night you can throw in the internet for free.Would I stay here again? Maybe. But only for a much better rate. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"good option I stayed two separate nights here and chose this expensive option so I would have somewhere nice to stay before leaving at midnight for a flight. I enjoyed my stay here as I wanted to relax near the pool for last day of three week trip. The pool is good and has gardens nearby so feels quite relaxed - like all of delhi you can still hear the forever trafic noises and also building nearby, so headphones were handy! The rooms were very quiet though with very comfy beds. I thought the rooms were a good standard and room service worked well. Like the last reviewer I also found the service very strange for an expensive hotel. I was served warm drinks at the pool, given the bill to sign five times while mid mouthful at breakfast, yet found it impossible to get a coffee from anyone. The evening buffet looked great but wasn't the tastiest food and again service was very haphazard. I also found the reception and coffee area absolutely freezing and the bar on a friday night was as loud as a nightclub with the music pounding around the whole reception area and competing with the other reception music. Even though the service was bizarre, I would still recommend this hotel and would return here as the rooms were good, quiet and pool area relaxing. I also stayed at the metropolitan and if a pool is important to you the shangri-la is much nicer as metrop pool is in a concrete setting and seemed to be only used by pigeons. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Stay Elsewhere I recently stayed at the Shangri-La and wish that I had stayed elsewhere. The reception desk was aloof, unfriendly and slow. One minute they bow to you obsequiously at the door (which makes me uncomfortable), and the next minute they smugly and unsmilingly check you in at the desk. Why the attitude? I have no idea - perhaps due to some misguided notion of what a luxury hotel is! Also, the service at the restaurants was incredibly slow and ineffective. The servers will look at you and smile in response to your requests, leaving you thinking that they understand what you are asking for. Of course, they don't and you end up having to ask three servers for the same thing. We had an average dinner at 19 Oriental Avenue (overhyped, to be sure), but the service (or lack thereof) infuriated me. After we were seated and served our appetizers, the waiters apparently forgot we were there. We sat in front of our empty soup bowls for almost half an hour and did not get our entrees until over an hour after we had been seated. They treated us to dessert as an apology, but I don't want free dessert - just give me halfway decent service! We also had a heck of a time getting a simple pot of fresh-brewed tea at breakfast, because they have tea sitting around in coffee carafes on a shelf rather than taking the minimal effort required to provide its patrons with a fresh pot every time. One morning, I discovered a lipstick smudge on the rim of my teacup. When asked for a clean cup, they gave me one - which later had to be replaced because they served me that stale tea. My third teacup, which arrived before I finally got a fresh pot of tea, also (you guessed it) was stained with someone's lipstick! Argh - four tries for a cup of tea! My room was small and smelled of mildew . . . and the shower drain did not work, so the shower water flooded over the inch-high divider of the shower stall (no bathtub!) and soaked the floor of the entire bathroom. For some reason, they inundate guests will all sorts of local periodicals, which creates a mess.In addition, the &quot;contemporary&quot; style of the hotel lobby is cheesy and somehow smacks of the 80s, and the place is FREEZING cold. Oh, yes, and the concierge service was a joke. We had the concierge book tickets on a train. Later, when we had to cancel the tickets, we could not get our money back before checking out because the concierge who booked our tickets used a log-in that his colleagues did not have. Ridiculous. On the plus side, the business center was functional, room service was prompt, and our room seemed clean (if musty-smelling). Overall, no one used to staying at true luxury hotels should choose this hotel. If you typically stay at Four Seasons hotels (or at the Oberoi hotels in Asia), for example, you will find the service here as laughable as we did. Our stay did not meet expectations. And if you are just looking for a clean Delhi hotel with solid service and amenities, well, you could find that at many of the large international chain hotels in Delhi without paying nearly as much as the Shangri-La charges. I can't imagine any type of customer who would be better off staying at the Shangri-La then elsewhere. We will not be returning! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"5 star as it should be Really enjoyed our stay here although it is quite expensive. Happily were were upgraded to the horizon exec floor with access to the lounge for snacks &amp; drinks in the evening (we didn't need to go out for dinner b/c the snacks were so comprensive as was the champagne ;)The breakfast was unbelievable - so much choice. Staff good if a bit robotic. The pool was great although can get quite congested at around lunchtime and there never seemed to be enough loungers so get there early! Didn't use the spa itself but the changing area / showers / sauna etc were amazing. Staff there were really unfriendly there though. DON'T order an airport taxi from the hotel - they charge a staggering 2,700 rp for a standard a/c car when you can get a standard taxi for 300!!!!Staff seem to expect tips for everything and I got the feeling they expected 5* tips rather than the standard 20rp that is the norm for India! Rooms were lovely, bathroom great - loved all the L'Occitane toiletries! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Just OK For the extortionate cost the Shangri La is comfortable but not outstanding. Compact bathrooms, bathwater warm, not hot, random hairs left in bathroom. Good room service.Island bar unwelcoming decor (cant read drinks menu due to blue lighting had to ask for torch!). A number of wines we requested not available. Pretty empty, mostly lone male guests nursing drinks. The Oberoi 360 bar and restaurant is far more vibrant and buzzing (and they know how to make a cocktail).Cafe ok, buffet ok. Good Pizza. Would be boring to eat there more than one night. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Perfect! Just from the time you enter the hotel, its fantastic, the people at reception greet you well, the rooms are great and modern, resturant is also good. location is central, and also away from the noises.All in all one of the best hotels i have stayed in India. would definately stay here when i visit Delhi again. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Outstanding Hotel The Shangri La provides precisely what you would expect from a leading hotel in the category: Luxury accommodation and absolutely first-rate service.It is when we asked for more, however, that the Shangri La really came into it's own. Nothing was too much trouble for the desk staff (from us, desperate to wash away the dust of the Punjab and requesting to be checked in from the bar, to arranging a car to the airport at the last minute). The rooms are small, but well appointed and well maintained. Bars and restaurants are world-class, and the wine list (personally selected by the vinophile GM Andrew Steele) is probably the best in India.In a city where quality and price do not always carry the relationship that one would anticipate, the Shangri La is a very safe choice. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Mostly Cripple Friendly Note: I am a c5 tetraplegic with c6/c7 functionality. I use a manual wheelchair. My reviews are made from this perspective.I stayed at the Shangri-La Delhi for two nights, five days apart. It is a lovely five-star hotel. The disabled access room had a nice wheel-in shower. There was no shower chair (either temporary or fold-down) so I had to phone reception to arrange something. The best they could do was a plastic school chair, complete with attached mini table (which was handy for sitting the shampoo within reach but made transfers in and out a bit trickier than was strictly necessary). The chair was adequate but I would have expected a slightly better solution – surely I’m not the first wheelchair user that has wanted a shower!There were lots of grab rails in the bathroom in sensible places.The most disappointing aspect of my stays was having to make three phone calls and wait 45mins to get the staff to bring back my little red school chair on my second visit, five days later. The wardrobe coat hangers were at standard height. Other than those minor quibbles, the hotel was excellent. Easily manageable for a solo wheelchair user.The only meal I ate in the hotel was breakfast, which was great. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Wonderful! Fantastic hotel, a bit expensive, but it's great if arriving late at night and just want a really nice comfortable place to kickstart your holiday!The breakfast buffet was awesome, the food in the roomservice was wonderful and everything was just pure class!Very nice and professional staff.. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Good business hotel We struggled choosing this hotel among several New Delhi options. We are Shangri-La Horizon frequent stay cardholders, so ended up choosing this one for that reason, since it seemed similar to other options.We stayed on a Club floor, and used the Club lounge several times for drinks, snacks and breakfast. The Club lounge has excellent views and since we were here for tourism, we were spending a lot of time walking...and this was a comfortable &quot;home&quot; to arrive at after getting tired of walking.The rooms are fairly neutral...similar to what you would expect from any international chain hotel, but that is typically the case with Shangri-La. Since we spent the previous part of our trip staying in hotels that were unique in experience, this was a bit of a let down, and in retrospect, we should have searched for a hotel that was more unique to experience the country and culture.As usual in Shangri-La, the buffet lunch/dinner is an outstanding combination of local and international cuisines...and a major reason why we like Shangri-La hotels. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Expensive stay I was offered to stay at the shangrila by my company .The room was big.The buffet was continental.The bar at the hotel was excellent one of the best to unwind urself.The hotel was good and the service excellent.I wouldnt stay if i was on my own the price is just too high for an asian hotel.cheers, "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Met the expectations we had when booking Overall, we were pleased with the hotel. The lobby is impressive and nicely decorated. We ate dinner at the restaurant and had breakfast three times there. I was pleased with the food, the service was just ok. We found the staff in the lobby cafe to be great, very enthusiastic to help and friendly.Our downside to our stay was the manager who we dealt with when we were checking out. There was a mis-calculation on our bill and we brought it up with him and his staff. His arrogance and lack of customer service will seriously be the death of this hotel unless the Shangrila does some better human resource management. This individual gave us a bad taste of how we could easily be ripped off in India. The Western concept of the customer coming first, obviously does not apply. Nice hotel, but staff needs to be trained on how to deal with foreign customers who are paying a lot to stay there. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"No regrets Not a great start to our honeymoon when the hotel driver failed to meet us at Delhi station. Several calls to hotel and 30 odd mins later standing in 40 C, got picked up and my severe irritation evaporated in a sea of cold towels an bottled water.The marble lobby, chandeliers and waterfall feature all create a big 'wow' factor and impressed by smooth and seamless check-in at our executive suite on the 8th floor, which had lovely panoramic views over the tree -covered embassy district and India Gate.Marble bathroom had great walk in shower and amenities, but normal bath not soaking tub I was hoping for. One minor quibble was the repair to marble crack in shower which had been rather crudely done.The bedroom and living room were superb, and lavishly equiped with excellent king size bed, excellent linen and a plethora of cushions and pillows. Massive wardrobe space, two large t.v.'s and dvd/cd player.Little touches were appreciated such as complimentary fruit and placed daily on the dining table, and twice daily housekeeping.Recommend hiring a car and driver to get around the frenetic city. The concierge staff write down where you want to go and hand it to the driver, after also writing down taxi registration number, so as to discourage any taxi drivers that may want to rip-off naive tourists, very reassuring.Hired a hotel car for sight seeing on second day-good value for 3500INR (£40) for 4 hours, but the qu aint ambassador taxi (extra to have the air con on) we hired for over 4 hours on third day was only 600 INR (less than £10)-including air con, and a nice memory of the old India.Breakfast in one word was 'stupendous'. English. American, Japanese, Chinese and of course various Indian dihes always available-no qeueing, and although a buffet affair, eggs always cooked to order, drinks orders taken at table and bought to you, and the staff always happy to get you any dishes if you didnt want to move out of your chair.Cafe bar was always busy throughout day and evening, main restaurant was very good-the lal maas recommended, but ask for it be cooked for an 'indian palate' as I suspect chilli and spice heat toned down a little for western visitors. On our last night splashed out at the signature 'oriental' restaurant on the first floor. It was made into a superlative experience by the warm but unobtrusive service of the staff...welcomed by a signature cocktail of the evening on the house...my wife didnt like her soup (nothing wrong with the soup, just not to her taste) and the waiter insisted on exchanging it for something else gratis...dessert truly scrumptious...great window table with a view...not cheap by Indian standards, but we're talking fresh sushi made by a Japanese chef, which came to a £100-a bargain in England for four courses and drinks.The island bar was impressive in layout and had a very wide selection of drinks, and attentive staff but as I found elswehere in India, limited in the range of cocktails offered. If you like cocktails like I do, then I recommend you carry a cocktail recipe book with you. Quiet during the day, didnt go in evenings (my wife doesnt drink), but they had music on in evenings and martini themed nights too.Did not use the spa or pool and jacuzzi a lot but did have a swedish massage which lasted for 60 mins. Very professionally done in excellent surroundings on basement floor. Left me feeling very relaxed, and was relatively inexpensive. On last morning we had early train to catch, breakfast arrived in our room on the dot at 0600, and were whisked to station in hotel car-meeting and departing in hotel car part of room rate, as is breakfast.Delhi was over 40 degrees during our stay, so the very efficient air conditioning in all areas of the hotel was a godsend-you only knew how good it was when you stepped outside the hot...air con in our room was a tad too cool on first day and control panel was stuck, an engineer came and fixed the problem within 10 mins with a minimum of fuss and disruption.In conclusion we thorughly enjoyed our stay, and although £250 a night is a lot by Indian standards, it is not by English standards. We got a superb suite with a view, very good food, a hotel that looks like new, and service that was faultless and friendly. We would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Solid hotel with some niggles Very much like the other '5-star' hotels in Delhi, in that you get what you pay for, with excellent standards of service and bar(s) and restaurants to 'western' tastes, however there are some issues with the rooms which disappointed.This was a business trip for four of us, and we used the hotel's airport pick-up service; which included nice cold face towels and a small bottle of chilled mineral water which were refreshing in the 41C heat. On arrival at the hotel there were four greeters who took each of us directly to our rooms for check-in formalities to be completed there. Very nicely done.Only later did I recall that the hotel's website says that Deluxe rooms have separate walk-in showers - my room did not. On querying this I was told that this was a mistake on the website but that they would move me as I had expected a separate shower, apparently only included in the top tier 'premier' room. However, I'm still not sure what the true situation is with this, different colleagues were told different things, and descriptions from other reviewers appear to contradict this too.The first room had twin beds and was somewhat crowded by the furniture being crammed in to what is essentially a small room. The bathroom has a large picture window to the bedroom with a blind if one requires privacy! The evacuation floor plan indicates that all the rooms are this size except for x11 and x12 which have the bigger bathrooms and the rooms at the end of both corridors that are small suites.So the second room was larger, with some additional furniture. Despite being a 'better' room, the TV was older and not a flatscreen as the lower-rate room had. The TV speaker in the bathroom did not work. A colleague's room had a dvd player, mine did not.The light on the shaving mirror also did not work, and the bath appeared to have been damaged and a poor effort at using filler to repair it was evident (see photo). The shower also leaked water across the bathroom floor.There is no alarm clock in the room. I called to have the iron replaced, as smoke (not steam!) came from it when I plugged it in... and the state of the ironing board was shameful, covered in dirty stains. The flashing light on the smoke detector was very bright and unmissable in the nighttime darkness. I also received two wrongly connected calls during my three days.There is a new complimentary 2 liter bottle of water left in the room daily, and turn down service is provided.Breakfast in Cafe Uno was very comprehensive and the most extensive and impressive fruit salad range I have seen: Lovely pomegranite! We also ate at the Oriental restaurant, and the food was plentiful and enjoyable. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Really liked this hotel Stayed 5 days at the Shangri-La. The hotel was wonderful. This place is what service should be at every hotel. A bit of a bummer that the pool was out of service but aside from that perfect. Upgraded to executive suite, which was well worth it. lounge on 19th floor is outstanding. Breakfast and view are great. The whole staff is courteous, polite, and helpful in every way. And to top it off, a copy of Lost Horizon (my personal epiphany 30 years ago) in every room. Will make Shangri-La my new preference in Asia.One suggestion - switch from wired to wireless so we can move around the room a bit. A minor detail "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Nice but not as good as many Shangri-La's I'm staying right now at the Shangri-La, New Delhi, and while the service is absolutely perfect, I do have some quibbles about the rooms.Prices here in Delhi are sky high, and the rooms here, while very nicely appointed, are very small, compared to other Delhi hotels. I was upgraded to a Horizon Club room, which are supposed to be much nicer than regular rooms, and the two of us are rather cramped. There's a chair in the room, but no sofa. The worst is the bathroom -- it's the tiniest bathroom I've ever seen in a Shangri-la. There's barely enough room for us to place our toiletries, not even enough room for towel rods. There's only one sink, and the toilet is tightly rammed between the tub and the small sink. There's also this ridiculous new decorative idea of placing a large glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom -- I think to forestall the claustrophobia of the bathroom. But trust me, even with a long married couple, privacy issues demand that the shade remain closed.The other issue with the bathroom is that there is no way to keep the floor from flooding when you take a shower. We tried everything, and then gave up.Sorry to keep harping on the bathroom, I was just surprised since we are paying so much. Also, though it is a new hotel, the carpet is already stained and the furniture already looks tired. Another bothersome issue is the loud pipes. I was awakened several times by loud flushes and someone taking a bath in the middle of the night. I could hear the tub filling as if it was in my own room. Hard to get back to sleep until whoever it was finally drained the tub, (and I heard every drop go down the pipe).One more criticism -- the sprinkler system over our bed has lights on it that flash all night long. Bring along your airplane eye patches.The good points, however, are the Shangri-la beds, which I adore -- huge and comfy. Linens could be softer -- ours were a bit scratchy.Another good point -- the Horizon Club, which has free wireless internet, 3 computer stations, and fabulous service and food.Food at all of the restaurants is marvelous, and the breakfast buffet in the downstairs cafe is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. They make scrumptious masala dosas to order!So, in conclusion, this is a perfectly FINE hotel, but it's not up to the higher standards you may have experienced from other Shangri-La's. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Check Your Bill Carefully! as i was checking out, the guy next to me was having a bitter argument with an arrogant receptionist . she accused him of printing 16 pages in the business center, and he kept saying he did not set foot over there. the signature on the printing bill was apparently not his, nevertheless the robotic receptionist kept accusing him.my bill contained &quot;only&quot; a few telephone calls i never made. i said in a very loud voice that i did not make these calls, to let other guests hear. it worked. the recptionist surrendered without arguing while the other poor guy was still trying in vain to prove he never had time to go to the business centre.i do not know who won: the lowlife receptionist or the dignified Indian businessman.one thing i know: you have to be alert in this hotel! check your bill carefully! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Comes highly recommended The Shangri la is a well maintained well run 5 star hotel.We stayed for a week and we are fussy but could not fault them on anything. The staff are friendly and efficient. The food is first class especially the morning breakfast buffet which is amazing- western ,indian, chinese and japanese breakfasts. Concierge is good and organize taxis who actually use their meters. Location is central, views fantastic and rooms although small, are well appointed. There is a wonderful ambience to this hotel with a beautiful lobby full of fresh flowers and a nice bar which served amazing wines by the glass. The price is expensive but this is Delhi in India in 2008 so what do you expect? I would have got a lot less in London or Paris for the same price. well done Shangri la "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Forced Weight Loss! Dine at the buffet restaurant. After a few meals, or perhaps, if you are “lucky”, on your first encounter with this microbes-lab, you become attached to your bathroom. After twenty four hours of diarrhea you feel like having something in your stomach. Use room service to order toasts and butter, like I have done, with a can of soda and a little bit of plain rice. You are doomed to be charged 1600 Rs, like I was charged. In the civilized world this is about $42. Plus tax it’s about $50!So if you don’t lose weight on account of massive diarrhea, you do anyway, on account of shock.And suppose that, after losing weight, you feel entitled to a small sin. You walk into the same buffet restaurant, and this time you don’t dare touch the food, but you only ask if you can have two tiny marzipans, both of them together about the size of a match box. You are punished with yet another shocker of 500 Rs, or, in the civilized world’s language – $13.3. plus tax. And yet again you have a chance to run away and keep you new weight, without suffering, and with a bonus: you don’t let them rip your guts off again!! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Loved the pol area This is an excelent property with a brand new spa, close proximity to all the sites, and great rooms. The pool area is large and expansive although the water is not heated so it is brisk. The check in area is large and the proces is swift.The ground floor restaurant has excellent fare and a great outdoor sitting area. On the whole I would give the staff high marks. Having said that, my stay was marred by one cocky individual - the health club manager N. Prithni Raj who seems to think his arrogance is somehow justified because he works out alot. He hits on all the women and seems he has a major attitude. But the other staff are excellent, and he seems the only bad apple.Overall, I would give this hotel 5 stars and would highly recommend it. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"A contrast to other Shangri La's I can't say I'm an expert in ShangriLa's chain of hotels, but I stayed in the Delhi Shangri La Hotel but was not very impressed. I have jst been to the Shangri La in Oman, which was much more immaculate than this one. The food was kind of a disappointment, as they had no Halal food for Muslims, so I had to live on fried pinapple slices and salads throughout my business trips! I was quite hungry!!!But overall, its a good hotel in comparison to others in India. It was my first trip to India so I didn't want to take any chances. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Beware! You Sit and Sleep on PESTICIDE! As you walk into the hotel you notice a very special smell. There is a definite fragrance of air freshener, but there is something else. This is a smell with a special aroma. Want to know what is it?Well, late at night, a guy with a huge cylinder, hose attached, moves around the lounge area in the lobby. He sprays, or actually drowns the carpet, the sofas and the armchairs with PESTICIDE, mixed with air freshener solution!From time to time the same perfumed pesticide is being sprayed in the rooms and down the corridors.This is “new India”. India of the rich, and the non - rich who live in everyday proximity to the rich, and adopt the unbelievable arrogance of the “new Indians”, seemingly “Westernized”, but still wiping their noses at the dinner table with the napkin or their scarf….The receptionists are as arrogant as third world people who work in posh hotels can be. If everything goes smooth you are treated with hypocritical smooth politeness, and If you arrive exhausted after a long trip you take it to be real . But actually they are horrible. If you have the smallest problem when checking in or out you are doomed to be treated by the most arrogant and rude personnel you ever saw.And yes, like in every third world country, maintenance and repairs are done at night. I stayed three nights and every night there were a few strong booms which waked me up. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Worth the money Have just returned from my first trip to India and can't praise the Shangri-La highly enough. The rooms were very comfortable and well-equiped and the facilities offered by the Horizon Club made the extra cost worth it. (high tea, evening drinks and canapes, airport pick up to name but a few)- yes, it is expensive but no more so than other 5 star hotels in Delhi and I came away feeling that the money was well spent.On our return at the end of the trip we were upgraded to a suite - really lovely way to end what had been an amazing holiday.The staff are incredibly professional and friendly and are a real asset to the hotel.If you are wondering whether to book go ahead, I don't think you'll be disappointed. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"First class The Delhi Shangri-La maintains the high standard associated with the brand. No it's not cheap, but the hotel is immaculately maintained, Horizon Club is well worth the extra (try to stay on the top floor for higher ceilings), service is excellent, great pool, and a good position in New Delhi. Downsides are that the rooms are on the small side, food is a bit bland, and pickup from the Domestic Terminal was chaotic, but it's still the place to stay. Visited the neighbouring Imperial Hotel and would stay at Shangri-La in preference.Not far away is The Park hotel. Do have dinner at &quot;Fire&quot;, but don't go till 9.30pm – no-one else in Delhi does! Cost for a hotel car with driver to view the sights (don't miss Humayun's Tomb) is reasonably priced, by 5 Star Standards at US$20 per hour. A taxi is much cheaper, but I felt the Shangri-La service is worth the extra. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Good but expensive. We stayed here for three nights, paying £549 full prepayment in advance through Asiarooms.com. This was the cheapest rate we found, not only for this hotel, but any of the 5* Delhi hotels with good Tripadvisor ratings.Our hotel room was spacious and clean, with a reasonable view at the back of the hotel (although higher floors and those facing the front or sides of the hotel would have been better). The pool area was pleasant, and there is a nice terrace within the garden in which you can sit to eat or drink. Restaurant and bar facilities were also good, with lunch buffets offered in both the Thai and Indian restaurants, although we opted for ala carte which was cheaper where only snacking, and we had no complaints with the food. Service throughout was generally impressive.Overall, this is a pricey hotel (but within a city where hotels are generally pricey!) and whilst not amazing, leaves little to gripe about. Recommended. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"good hotel but overpriced Being in India for the first time on a short business trip, I didn't want to take any risk and that's why I booked this hotel.What I liked is that I had the option to get for free a late checkout at 6pm (my flight back to Brussels was after midnight, this saved me an additional night), but having to pay 20.000 INR per night for a premier king room is overpriced for a place where people earn less than 100$ a month. Yes, there were friendly (and goodlooking) girls at the entrance welcoming you everytime you got back in the hotel and yes, there was someone providing you with soap in the public restroom and yes, the food was great , the rooms were ok and well equipped etc... but I find this hotel overpriced... Drinking a beer in your room costs some 10$ and the portion of cashews I ate were only a bit cheaper. pffffThe restaurant has a great variety of choice, food is really good...but again extremely overpriced. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent Hotel but Overpriced I stayed at the hotel in January 2008 whilst on a business trip in Delhi. The hotel is clean and a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Delhi.Rooms are small but clean and well equipped with a LCD TV, mini-bar, coffee facilities and internet access. The view from the room was not great but then I did get a cheaper room at £230 per night! By Delhi standards this is not an expensive hotel but in my opinion, this is not up to the standards of a hotel at this price point elsewhere in the world. Everything in Delhi is cheap until you step into the hotel and then its really expensive but I cannot understand why.The hotel drivers all moan that they do not get much money as a way of getting tips off you. The bell boy hangs around expecting a tip for bringing an overnight bag up that he grabbed off you as you walked in. The bar staff ask for tips,At busy times in the restaurant, service is non-existent. A pot of tea can take longer to arrive than you spend eating breakfast! The Thai restaurant is fantastic. Great food and service - the best place to eat in the hotel. The buffet restaurant food is not the best tasting or the biggest selection and the A la carte menu is a bit plain.Nonetheless its a nice hotel and I would stay here again but it has a number of failings which I hope they address before I book again. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Not bad not bad at all Very pleased (and suprised) to come off the 4.55am BA flight to find car waiting as promised at airport and room ready for me. Hotel is very central, extremely clean but ferociously expensive!Food in Horizon club exceptional, but dont wait til the last moment, they close it early. Staff extremely pleasant and attentive. Trouble is that at this price everything is pretty good, indeed exceptional, except value for money. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Some small niggles but overall good experience - a good hotel Three of us stayed here for four nights on business (now on my last night and writing this review from my room). We were booked into Club rooms which give you use of the &quot;Horizon Club&quot; lounge with free breakfast, Internet and free evening food. In terms of the rooms, this hotel could be anywhere in the world, and mostly lives up to its five-star rating.GOOD POINTS:- Nice rooms, of five star standard.- Excellent restaurants - but be aware that prices are more London than Delhi.- Staff are helpful and polite, and not as overpowering in their fuss as those I've experienced in other Delhi hotels.- Good location in Central Delhi.COULD BE BETTER:- on arrival, we were taken to the Horizon Lounge to check us in, in comfort. Comfortable as it was, form filling and formalities took over 30 minutes. What we really wanted was to go to our rooms and rest after a long flight. Not a biggie though, as they provided drinks and the surroundings were amiable.- If you are sensitive to noise - the one main complaint I would have is that the hotel skimped on plumbing, and whenever my next-door room showered or flushed I could hear it as an almighty noise. My very hygiene conscious neighbour showered a lot, and quite late, so sometimes I awoke with a start to the squelch of the plumbing.- A small point - the fire alarms on the ceiling have the brightest pilot light I have seen, and it blinks in white flashes that made me feel like I was sleeping under a runway. I did get used to it after day three...And finally - a tip for those booking club rooms: try to get a room on the 19th (top) floor, as they are slightly better than the other floors (I stayed on the 16th, and got a tour of my colleagues' rooms upstairs). "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Wonderful staff I changed my New Delhi hotel booking to the Shangri La on the advice of my brother, who had just stayed there and I was so glad I did. It was a wonderful experience and the staff couldn't have done enough for us. We had a room on the Club floor and the Club lounge was very comfortable with a lovely view over the hotel gardens and a busy roundabout, bustling with traffic. It was on a high floor so you were on the same level as some huge, wild birds circling. They might have been eagles, but I'm not an expert! Anyway, we stayed for one night, then headed off to Agra for one night and came back for another two nights. The hotel staff very kindly kept our two bottles of duty free Champagne in their fridge while we were gone and then let us drink it in the lounge when we got back. They probably aren't supposed to do that, but it was a very nice touch.I loved the breakfast buffet, especially the Indian dishes, including the wonderful paratha. There was an enormous selection and it was difficult not to pig out. I also tried the far eastern restaurant twice and was impressed. My Tom Kha Gai was exactly as it would be in Thailand.The only downside to the experience is that there was some confusion over when we checked in. We arrived around 9 in the morning and they told us that we could get into our room. However, when it came to check out, they wanted to charge us another night for the early arrival to the room. I know this is what hotels do, and if I had wanted to pay for the room for an extra night for the convenience of checking in early, I would have done that, however I know that if the hotel is not full, sometimes they will let you check in early and not charge you. However, they need to tell you at the time you check in that they will be charging you an extra night, and they did not, so after some discussion they agreed to let us off and rightly so. If I had been informed when checking in that we would have to pay for an extra night, I would have just left my cases in the lobby and come back later. Bit naughty.Overall, though, I cannot fault the hotel and would definitely stay there again. It was very welcoming and had all the facilities that I require when travelling. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"An Oasis of calm We added a night here after finishing a private tour and like other travellers, were ready for a calm stay after spending time on the road. The hotel lived up to expectations and met the standards of other Shangri La hotels that I have stayed in. It was very friendly and I didn't have any problems with check in and check out.The food was excellent and we loved the evening buffet with kebabs cooked by the side of the pool. The room was very pleasant and the overall calmness of the hotel was a very welcome contrast to our attempts to walk round Delhi by ourselves. It was exactly what we were looking for. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Luxury In India The Shangri-La is a beautiful hotel! The lobby and grounds are very impressive. Each night the staff assembled a very nice candle display in the front window.Our package including breakfast which was wonderfully prepared in the cafe downstairs. The buffet was full of fresh fruits and any kind of breakfast food one would desire.The patio area offered beautiful views of the well-maintained grounds, including a hugh rock waterfall. The pool was very large.The standard rooms were a bit small but very comfortable and very clean. Even though this hotel is located on a busy street, the outside noise was kept to a minimum.Check-in was a bit slow but the staff was incredibly friendly.We would definitely stay here again. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Not quite a par with other Shangri-La hotels Having stayed at other Shangri-Las such as in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, I expected a top-notch efficient hotel with attention to detail. Alas, though the breakfast brunch offering was of the same high caliber, overall service quality and room decor were not. During breakfast, I had to constantly request coffee as the staff seemed to be walking around aimlessly (the dining room was only half full). Linen setting seemed incomplete in my area of tables (I had to take a serviette from a neighbouring table). It took me 45 minutes to check out, and this was in the Club Lounge! The luxury tax (from which my organization is exempt) needed to be manually credited (why???) which challenged the employee tremendously. Decor wise, the entrance had the trademark wow factor of the chanin but the different elements did not work together. The rug in the room needed a deep cleaning. On the plus side, the complimentary cocktail nibble selection in the club lounge was quite satisfying. While these may seem like small shortfalls, one has to be remember the room rate was close to $400! At that price, one expects near flawless service levels, would you not agree? "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"lovely hotel and staff Have stayed in this chain before so knew roughly what to expect but the service and quality of this hotel exceeded my expectations. Everything about it was lovely, especially the wonderful spa. Staff were without exception welcoming and friendly in a way that I am sure is genuine and caring. Truly wonderful stay and I would go back. Nicely situated too. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"An Oasis in New Delhi After a nightmare road journey from Agra, we arrived late evening at this centrally located hotel for a three night stay. Staff were welcoming and the room we were allocated was clean and had all the facilities to be expected of a hotel of this type. Membership of the Horizon Club was included. We had a choice of restaurants to eat in, but used the Cafe Uno throughout and had no complaints with the food or service. Staff were efficient and friendly and not overbearing. We spent some time by and in the hotel pool, an oasis of calm amidst the constant noise and bustle outside. An expensive hotel but we had no complaints and a complimentary car to the airport on the last morning sealed an excellent stay. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Absolutely lovely Having had our flight cancelled, along with some colleagues we decided we would try and stay at this hotel for the night even though the airline had offered us a freebie somewhere else. Well, it was worth it. What a marvellous hotel. Everything was perfect - the reception, the restaurant and the rooms are to die for. It was such bliss and I was hoping like crazy my flight would be delayed indefinitely (unfortunately it didn't happen). "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Luxurious and friendly; expensive and soulless You know what you're getting with the Shangri La chain - extremely friendly and welcoming staff, a luxurious room, and a very comfortable stay. On the plus side, too, this hotel is very central (near Connaught Place) and although expensive, no more so than other 5-star hotels in Delhi, which are all ridiculously over-priced. But my biggest disappointment was that there was no atmosphere at all. I felt I could have been anywhere as, apart from some photos on the wall of my room, there was nothing that gave me a sense that I was in India. The outside area was actually very small, with only a lawn and a mock waterfall - no lush gardens as in some other Indian hotels. Overall, it seems a shame to quibble, as this is a very comfortable hotel indeed, but it is an un-memorable one. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Perfect! This is the most perfect place- at arrival meet by name at the lobby, and excorted to the room, much bigger than expected, and with everything wanted. Nice bathroom, though not seperate shower. Window glass to bathroom - who uses that?, but .., Laundry included in pacage, so went home with only clean close. Nice buffet restaurant, uno, and nice poolarea.The spa was beautyfull, and made the most wonderfull treatments.Stayed before in th Imperial, but this is much better, the service faster, the rooms, as not so spetacular, but every littelthing was working,. Stay ther next time for sure!!! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent room in a super location My room at this hotel was so nice I didn't want to go sightseeing! From the moment I checked in (at 1:00 am) the service was excellent and I was amazed at the gorgeous floral displays in the lobby. After 25 hours of flying, those things count. I visited in August when the heat was sweltering, but the hotel was totally comfortable. My room was luxuriously appointed with the finest linens, wonderful lighting, lovely furniture, a good amount of space, and a bathroom I wish I could copy at home. Everything about it said 'relaxed luxury'. It was also very quiet. It was a treat to stay there. The location is near all the major sites (and offices), and I *really* appreciated the pool. The only complaint I had was that the breakfast staff took five requests on my part to bring me a second cup of coffee. But if that's the worst thing that happens on a trip, then I consider myself lucky! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Fabulous hotel great service and we found slightly more reasonable than other d my sister and i went backpacking through india in april but we decided to treat ourselves with our first night in delhi. i researched a lot of the top hotels in delhi and found the shangri-la to be one of the more reasonable. The hotel had a complimentary pick up service from the airport which was aplus for 2 girls arriving into india, the chaffeur who picked us up had cool flannels and bottled water for us, v nice touch!!The lobby to the hotel was lovely, cool and full of fresh flowers, and our receptionist escorted us to the room personally. the room was fab, very nicely decorated, plush and with great views. the breakfast buffet the next day was also amazing. the pool is nice, not wow, but its what you would expect from a city hotel. The spa looked lovely but we didnt try it. All in all great service, location and competitively priced! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Disappointed Not only is the hotel fully booked almost every day due to business travellers, but it is also totally overpriced with rather unhelpful service. Disappointed in every way possible. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,comfortable place This is a nice hotel. Service is good.Clean &amp; comfortable rooms.Overall good value for money. It's just like any other Shangri la s minus the frills. Dont expect too much personal attention or service as the hotel is always well booked and staff are busy .Front desk is not too friendly but the rest of them are very helpful.Nice bathrooms with good amenities. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Experience for sharing Visiting and staying in Shangri-La hotel New Delhi is a bitter experience for me. The hotel's dining room is not properly cleaned, poor service had made me disappointed. No proper guidance to foreign guests. All the other guests should consider this once. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Loved the William Problem on check in/check out,Food was not hygenic,services were not as Five star hotel "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Not the service you would expect The service is really spotty and some of the hotel staff is amazingly rude &amp; impolite. Having stayed at a number of Oberoi, Taj, &amp; Trident Hilton hotels in India, the difference was glaring. This hotel charges as much as the best Delhi hotels, but the service is not even close to what the other hotels provide.Althoug some of the staff is good, there are many poorly trained people to overshadow the decent service of the good one's. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"A pleasant modern hotel The Shangri-La is a very pleasing, friendly hotel and being one of the newest hotels in New Delhi, it is modern and contemporary in look and feel. Very small rooms, though. Some rooms have 4-fixture bathrooms with a shower cubicle in addition. Very nice Club lounge (Horizon). The food outlets are also very good. Small business centre but adequate for most needs. Outstanding spa! (expected from the Shangri-La).Upsides: 1.Extremely friendly and accomodating staff. 2.Location3.Good buffet breakfast -- usually included.Downsides: 1. Small rooms. 2. The lobby has place only for five people to sit. So,if you are meeting or waiting for someone, either stand or take a table in the Lobby Lounge. Needs to be addressed.3.Luggage transfer to room seems to take ages. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Absolutely Fantastic Hotel We have just returned from a two week stay in India. We stayed in the Shangri-La twice, at the start and the end of our trip. We stayed on the Horizon Club Floor.This hotel is not cheap but it is easy to see why. It is absolutely fantastic in every way!The staff are wonderful and extremely friendly, the location is great and the hotel itself is a welcome sanctuary from the craziness of New Dehli.The Spa area is beautiful and some of the treatments are actually surprisingly reasonably priced.We were upgraded to an Executive Suite on the second period of our stay without asking or for any reason that we are aware of.There were 6 of us in our group staying in all ranges of the rooms and no one had a single negative comment about the Shangri-La.I would 100% recommend this hotel for anybody that has the money to stay, it is well worth it. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Brilliant luxury hotel Excellent place in a good zone of Delhi. The rooms are very confortable and have good quality furniture. Considered the awful price-quality ratio of nowadays India, this is a sure bet if you wantstyle and service at a decent rate. Very good breakfast, and attentive reception. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent Despite the high prices, this hotel gives excellent value for money and makes itself stand out from other big chains by providing excellent service that is very personable, great food and very high levels of cleanliness. Great swimming pool (although the ice cream coffee that we drank there took a long time to prepare and was not as great as we had hoped!); the spa area is clean and very tidy with, rather strangely, a tv in the sauna and excellent service from the lady on duty. The airport pick up worked very well: I sent a reminder email some days before in order to reconfirm all details, and they even wrote back.We really enjoyed our stay here and would go back anytime. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"What a great choice! Spent five days at the Shangri-la and just had to write to say what a great value and experience it was. Upon arrival in Delhi by air at 11 PM on a Sunday night we were greeted by a hotel driver just as promised by the hotel! And it was included in the room rate along with a varied and highly tasty buffet breakfast spread. The service was friendly and personal and the concierge's knowledgeable advice, on which trains leave from which station, saved us from what could have been a costly error. The weather was in the low 40Cs when we were there, and the pool and spa area provided a relaxing oasis where one could easily get away from some of the less pleasing aspects of what is nevertheless a great city. An added bonus is that the hotel is just around the corner from the Imperial Hotel and it's fabulous Spice Route restaurant. Was able to book a room directly on their web site and the price was substantially better than comparable 5 star hotels with much less central locations. Should we ever go back to Delhi, it will be to the Shangri-la! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent I can't fault this hotel at all, other than it being in Delhi! The hotel looks as though it has been very recently renovated, and our room and all public areas were superb - very cool and modern. The service, as with all Shangri-la's I have stayed in is excellent. We ate in the oriental restaurant, which whilst it certainly wasn't cheap, it was excellent and the portions were huge. We got a pretty good deal here on Expedia - 85 GBP for one night. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Shangrila in name only forget the rest Definitely not worth it - rooms are (very) small service is very inconsisent and there are much better properties in Delhi especially for the price. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent hotel in good location I would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. We paid a bit extra and had a Horizon Superior room which is well worth the extra as you have transport to and from the hotel. We were met at the airport by a private car and after a delay of over 1 hour, our driver was patiently waiting. We were provided with two bottles of ice water and two cold flannels in the car, a nice touch. On arrival at the check in desk they transported us to the executive lounge where we were booked in and provided with a drink. In the price of the room is a breakfast in the club lounge, bearing in mind this is not a full buffet, but more snacks and coffee, but enough to start the day with. Also included is the cocktail hour where you again can have canapes and drinks of wine, beer or spirits. I believe the lounge is free to go in any time and have a coffee, but we were too busy to experience this. Also free use of the internet, which was very useful to reserve our seats on the way home. The staff in the club room are very friendly. The restaurant called 19 Oriental Avenue Restaurant on the first floor was lovely with a choice of Thai, Chinese or Sushi. We had a chef special duck curry and a Thai curry with plain rice and they were both really good with drinks of coke for £23 for two, which is a good price for a hotel. Also tried the Cafe Uno but preferred the Oriental Avenue. The pool is lovely although very cold, with an attendant to bring cool drinks and snacks and there was only us there. The jacuzzi, didnt seem to work though. We travelled to Jaipur by train from the Shangri-la and again were transported there by private car and were picked up on the way back to stay at the hotel the last night. The driver asked what coach on the train we were on and was waiting for us on the station. Excellent service. We had booked a trip to Agra for the day after our arrival and we couldnt fault the concierge, who phoned the company we had booked with and helped us with our booking. The hotel is in a good situation and you can walk down the road, avoiding the tuk-tuk drivers and the people waiting outside the hotel, to the Metro, which is very efficient and clean and although it doesnt run everywhere, you can get to Old Delhi on this. Also walkable to India Gate. If there was a downside to all of this, it was that we were allowed to keep the room until later 9.00 p.m. and we were charged although we believed it was complimentary but I would definitely stay here again. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Lots of nice aspects. We stayed here twice, both going and coming. It has a great location in the center of town. If you want to walk to shopping you can just walk three or four long blocks north and you're in the heart of the city. Lots of shops one or two streets to the east or west too. When walking just ignore the tuk-tuk drivers and or the pedestrians. As our driver told us, &quot;no one is free in India.&quot; Anything anyone tells you is a lie or at best heavily weighted to get you to do something to get them a kickback. The hotel was high end generic. Everything was perfect but within the paradigm of a modern chic hotel. My wife got a haircut and a manicure at the spa and really like the woman who helped her. She was helpful and gave her a great cut. The spa was fine, it has the exact same layout as the Four Seasons in Doha Qatar but not as nice. I think it must be a well established template for spas. Not to complain it's a great template. Nice recessed water ways under the walkway and spotlights illuminating bowls of water, filled with Gerber daises. The pool was nice but the sun moved behind the building just when I was warming up, damn you sun!Restaurant was great. We had some excellent vegetarian Indian dishes. Breakfast was good and the coffee cups were big enough to ward of caffeine withdrawals. Best breakfast of all the hotels we stayed at. They did SNAFU our bill the last night. We sat in the restaurant for maybe an hour after dinner and wrote post cards and they never brought the bill. We left without thinking about it and they called at 11:30 to check. That annoyed me just give it to the front desk for god sakes. My other annoyance (and the president of Shangri-La is getting a business letter about this) was that the concierge did not give unbiased information. Now EVERYONE told us that no one in India was free but for some reason I naively expected a concierge of an international 4/5 star hotel to have my best interest in mind in fact that is in no small part what I pay for. This was not the case. See the quote at the top and judge accordingly. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"A poor choice My wife and I stayed at this hotel given the great reviews given. However, the stay was overpriced and disappointing. People rave about service, but we found out to be hollow, Yes staff seemed to always say that it (what ever problem we had) would be taken care off, but really was not. Also, the night manager either was ill informed about the heating/cooling or was not honest. We got a straight answer only by speaking to the heating and cooling personnel - they shut off the heating/cooling at night. Two things that were good: excellent breakfast buffer and a ride to the airport in a camary. We will not stay at this place again. I tried to contact the general manager - but I guess my email bounced back as it did not recognize my user id. I also sent a fax, which I never received a response. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"an oasis Delhi was our first stop on our two week private tour of India.To our horror,after a 15 hour flight,we find out at check-in that the hotel is over-sold and we had to relocate to the Intercontinental Eros 30 minutes away.We were not pleased.We even felt that the management were not truthful with us since it was obvious other people were allowed to check in after we arrived.The manager did not seem to take much resposibility for this mishap.I didnt think this sort of thing would happen since we were on a &quot;tour&quot;.After arguing for 30 minutes,getting us nowhere,we spent the night at the IC.We were promised an upgrade to a suite 9am the next morning.To our amazement at 9am we were quickly checked in into our suites.The remaining three days were wonderful.The suites were clean and spacious with lots of free bottled water.The morning breakfast was plentiful with good selection.The evening hors doevres and complimentary drinks were great.They did not skimp like other hotels.The staff were polite and efficient.The restaurants -we ate at all of them-were good and reliable.We did not get sick and we ate everything.The location was perfect.Clean,safe and relatively quiet area.Great views from the room of gov't buildings.Would recommend hotel despite the initial check in situation.Perhaps they need a little more training on dealing with room bookings. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Highly recommended We stayed on two occasions in Dec 2006. Had excellent stays both times--rooms were high quality, staff was very attentive and helpful, breakfast was good. The public spaces are small but well-appointed. The gym is excellent and staff there was very good. Car service from the airport was good.Would highly recommend the hotel. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent Hotel Stayed 3 nights at this hotel mid Feb with wife and two boys. Arrived 5.00am and found staff extremely welcoming and helpful as they were throughout stay. Rooms were very nice, modern, clean and comfortable. Buffet breakfast was excellent - very wide choice, good food. Evening buffet was also very good with wide selection to suite all tastes. Did not try other restaurants, but they looked very good as well. Hotel seems pretty well central for all sites and reasonably quiet (or as quiet as Delhi can be). Based on our experience I would not hesitate in staying here again - 1st class. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Nice Shangri-La another great stay at Shangri-La chain of hotel. I and my family loved this upscale hotel in the heart of south Delhi overlooking the Presidents' house. Extremely helpful and courteous staff and great room. Very nice bar and restaurant. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Very Comfortable Welcoming Hotel Our 3 night stay was a great start to our 3 weeks in India. The room was spacious and well appointed. Bottled water was plentiful and regularly replaced. The staff were warm and gracious. The breakfast buffet was extensive and included an international mix of choices. The central location was a plus. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"No Shangri-La. Ruined my impression of Delhi. I am a fan of Shangri-la hotels and am an executive member of the hotel's loyalty programme. I paid US$440 for a horizon club room and for this same amount, I could have stayed at the Imperial (managed by former GM of Island Shangri-la in HK) or the Oberoj or the Taj. Chose to stay at the Shang because it's a chain that I trusted and I thought that the service would be comparable to the other properties in Asia. Turns out that was the biggest mistake I could ever make. Here's a recount of my experience:1) Airport pickup. Limo transfer between airport and hotel is part of the &quot;extras&quot; included for staying at the horizon club. My flight arrived at 0215 on the 17th and even though the hotel has received my flight details, no one showed up to pick me up. According to the Director of Rooms and the Duty Manager, since I failed to make a reservation for the eve of the 16th, they had assumed that my flight actually arrives on the 18th. Since when does the world's clock stopped when midnight strikes? Going by their logic, no guest would have been picked-up at the airport before noon (their official check-in time and when the clock ticks again). Confronted the Directors of Rooms about the situation and he attempted to blame the travel agent for the error. Little does he know that my agent has already touched base with me and has told me that he had concerns about the hotel pickup service. After much bickering at the airport, where they claimed that transfer is not part of my package (even though it's clearly stated in my reservation and the welcome letter), and the duty manager's attempt to make me pay extra for the pickup, the duty manager finally caved and arranged for a jeep (not the limo as promised) to pick us up. That jeep probably belongs to someone that he knew and lives close enough to the airport to placate us.2) Check-in. Upon arrival, duty manager greeted us, but he made me agree to paying a full-night stay before letting me go upstairs to the horizon club to check in. How disrespectful and tactless is this? If money is an issue, I wouldn't be staying at the Shang! BTW, I only got into the room at 4AM. If the hotel's check-in time is 12, why do I have to pay a full night for providing &quot;service&quot; for 1/3 of the night? (Another couple who checked in before me also had the same complaint) Sadly, the Shang does not have a policy on full vs half night as the Four Seasons does.3) Customer relationship management. After wasting my time talking to the director of rooms, who did not take responsibility for airport pickup fiasco and attempted to blame me and my travel agent for the mix-up, I requested a meeting with the General Manager. The GM failed to even made contact when he returned to work on Monday and Tuesday. Even if he had no intention of talking to me, the very least he could have done is to leave a voicemail (knowing that there is a good chance I won't be in the room during the day). 4) Food. Horrible Asian restaurant. One can get better food from takeaway Chinese restaurants in the US or the UK! As for Cafe Uno, buffet selection is good, but taste doesn't compare to the food at the Oberoj or other local restaurants.5) Housekeeping. The hotel knew that the reservation is for two. Yet they set up everything, from towels to slipper, for one. Amenities aren't even replaced.6) Check-out. Having seen numerous errors when other guests checked out, I opted to check out the night before since I have to leave at 5AM. On my way out, while waiting for the car that I have prearranged with the hotel to show up, someone from the front desk chased after me claiming I have not paid for that extra night!! Come on, how much more disrespect do I have to put up!This Shang totally ruined my faith in the company and the Shang is putting the company's reputation at risk by keeping incompetent staff. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Nice stay but smoky public areas I chose this hotel for proximity to my business needs.First: the staff here are very freindly, and I have no complaints about any request I had (although I am not a really challenging guest.)The rooms very nice with comfortable beds, nice linens, good housekeeping, ironing board, and other amenities that one expects at a Shangri-La. The rooms are not excessively large, but a good size. The hotel is in a park-like setting, which makes for some nice psychic relief when traveling around Delhi.Some negatives: The public areas, bars, and restaurants can be nice, but I find them too smoky to be pleasant. Even after a few weeks in Asia, this was probably the smokiest business class hotel I stayed in. Also: I am getting testy that higher-end hotels (worldwide) still charge for internet access when so many 3-stars in the U.S. don't. However, since I as visiting one of our offices, I used the business services at that site.I will return to New Delhi in a few weeks, but will stay elsewhere. 'Nothing really wrong with this property, and it was a pleasant enough stay. However, it was expensive enough even with breakfast included, even at a corporate rate. I have booked an alternative. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Great Location!!! Shame about the service We booked in what Shangri-la called club horizon level room and paid well over GBP 240 pounds per night to stay in this hotel. Unfortunately the services provided is not up to standard. This hotel does not appear that they got their operations right or provide their staff with relevant training. This is no where near a 5 star hotel!!!!The free airport transfers was fine and the chaffeurs are all very professional. This does give a great impression of what the hotel would be.However upon reaching the hotel, our views gradually changed. When we checked in for club horizon room, you will be sent to the 19th floor. Fantastic!!! (That is what I thought, as you will get some individual attention). Unfortunately, the welcoming letter that they give you is address to the wrong person and to date, they still did not realise this. The duvet covers for one of the nights that we stayed in have &quot;HOLES&quot; in it!!!! This I cannot say how they can call themselves 5 star hotel!!!! We have to call the Conceirge before they will sent our luggage up the room!!!!!!!!!!! Although we do have free internet usage provided by the horizon lounge, not all the computers that they have is working all the time!!!!Buffet Breakfast was ok. However the waiter service there is terrible. You need to wait for ages for coffee and you need to order it twice. Everytime when you finish a plate, they do not pick this up in a timely fashion, Even though the restaurant is not full at all.We also went to their other restaurant that serves Japanese, Thai and chinese food. The waiter got our order wrong and the food quality is disappointing!!! It just reminds me of cheap and cheerful type of restaurant food. However the price that they are charging is not cheap at all. The food is very salty!!!!! I will stay away from this restaurant!!!When we checked out on the 19th floor, I did ask the staff there to sent someone to pick us the luggage from our room and I know she did call. However by the time that we were on the ground floor, it is obvious that our luggage is not there and that it appears that the conceirge have no knowledge of it. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I would say perhaps conceirge needs time management!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I was hoping I can give some constructive feedback to the hotel, however they do not even have feedback forms in the room!!!! Cannot believe this at all. When you checked out they did not even ask whether you have a great stay with them at all!!! As if they do not even care whether you will come back or not!!!!!After staying in this hotel and Trident Hilton Guragaon, I will definitely stay in Trident Hilton again!!!! Their service there is excellent!!!!!! Cannot fault any of Trident Hilton service!!!!! The Spa in Hilton is far better than Shangri-La!!!!!!!!! Worth every penny of it. Spa in Shangri-la is ok. Nothing to wow about!!!! I would avoid Shangri-La Delhi at all cost if you have to pay this sort of money for crappy service and not so great food quality!!!!! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"First class hotel We stayed at the Shangri La at the beginning and end of our trip to India, and I loved this hotel. + Hotel itself is only 1-2 years old, having been recently converted to a Shangri La and everything inside is new.+ Food was excellent in the main restaurant (the kebabs in the lobby bar though weren't very good)+ Spa is excellent; we were going to stay at the Imperial but I found out their spa is under construction. So we picked the Shangri La and have been very happy. Huge modern spa and gym in the basement.+ Bathrooms are clean and modern+ Bedding is new and very comfortable (similar to the Westin's or W Hotel's &quot;heavenly bed&quot;, if you've stayed there you know what I mean!);+ Service is top-notch. when we returned at the end of our trip for 1 night, much of the staff remembered us and welcomed us back! Everyone was friendly, professional and accommodating.+ Location is excellent, just south of the Imperial Hotel near Connaught Place. Much better location than either of the Taj Hotels or the Sheraton for walking around. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"stranded at the airport My wife and I stayed here our first 3 night in India. Our flight was to arrive very late at night / early morning. We didn't want to arrive from the USA at that hour of the day without a transfer to the hotel.I booked and paid the hotel for this service and confirmed it twice just before we left home.We did arrive at 1:30 AM on time. There was no one from the hotel in sight. We were left stranded there, exhausted and had no way of gettiing to the hotel.The pre-paid taxis had no idea how to get to this hotel and they had never heard of it. After talking to about 25 different drivers , one assured us he knew where it was. Of course he didn't and we drove around Delhi for 2 hours in the late night.We finally arrived at the hotel and the manager at first denied we had a transfer set up. After producing my confirming documentation, he admitted the &quot;mistake&quot;. Then his solution was to compensate us the 300 rupees we paid for the taxi. Now it's 4:30 AM and I'm argueing with the front desk manager. Unbelievable! He eventually agreed to give us access to the club level as some form of compensation. When we woke up , I opened the curtains to check out the view. I started laughing histerically! There are lots of pipes (water?) outside of our room and they are covered with pigeons and all that comes with pigeons.We closed the curtains and never looked out again.We were there on Jan. 4th-6th and the pool was not open that time of year, so we were told. I don't know how others got to experience the lovely pool area that is written in some others' reviews during this time.We left for Corbett Park with no luggage and the hotel refused to accept/hold our luggage for us. So if Lufthansa had delivered it to them , they told us they'd send it back! Thus there had to be a lot of conversations with Lufthansa , so they wouldn't deliver it to the Shangri-La.We came back to Delhi and stayed at the Taj. Much , much better everything! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Excellent service I stayed here while on a conference in Delhi. The attention to detail is amazing. So also the service, its manner and timing. Large spacious room with a very comfortable bed. The internet access is worth the money and was very conveniently done. I ordered a la carte, and was impressed with the food. The breakfast everyday is good as well, though I was a tad disappointed with the Indian breakfast. A very convenient and beautiful stay "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Awesome Hotel We were switched from a Taj hotel to the Shangri-la a week before our 3 week tour of India. . I was a little concerned, but when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised. The lobby and front desk personelle were so polite and friendly. The rooms were also amazing....The best bedding and pillows of all the hotels we stayed at.!!!The breakfast buffet was also the best. The quality and variety was great. We also liked the bar in the lobby and the Asian restaurant. Nice pool area and close to everything. Away from the chaos and we loved it. What a way to start out our trip. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"first class service we stayed at this hotel at the start of our trip to india and at the end, and i must say the service was excellent. i booked the hotel direct and upgraded to the horizon club. the room was for me and my partner and an extra bed for my daughter.we was picked up from the airport by limo which had cold water and cleaning towels to freshen up. the check in was smooth and done in our own room. the room was a good size on the 19 th floor, ( the horizon club floor ). we had the choice of soft drinks, hot drinks and snacks all day from the exclusive club room and then in the evening 2 hours of free drinks and cocktails. well worth the extra cost. we ate in the ground floor restaurant which had first class food.also use of the pool and spa area which is fantastic. my partner made use of some of the treatments which you had to pay for but still cheap by our standards.but the thing thar stands out for me was the nice, kind, polite and freindly staff, for whom nothing was to much trouble. especially the staff on the horizon floor.we had to check out late to catch a night train ( 9.00 pm ) but the limo was there for us . also we could use the horizon lounge again for food and dinks ( gratis ) even though we had checked out some hours earlier. thankyou mr marwah and all your staff. that is why we stayed there again before we flew home and had an equal experiance. highly recommended.

shangri la hotel new delhi ,LOVED THE EXPERIENCE Great service ang great breakfast. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Extremely disappointing After reading the positive reviews here, and based on previous experience with the Shangri-La group, I decided to stay at the Shangri-La New Delhi. What a mistake!The Negatives:The service at the front desk is absolutely appalling. They were never able to assist me with anything, prefering rather to give me a disinterested glare. After having made prior arrangements to have an additional bed provided in my room ( I was travelling with a child), the hotel informed me 3 hours after I checked-in they would not be able to provide an extra bed. The management were absolutely useless, unable to provide any explanations. They then had the audacity to imply that I hadn't made a prior arrangement, a statement they later retracted after they checked their system!At the very least, a 5star hotel charging $400.00 a night for an ordinary room should know how many guests to expect and prepare the rooms accordingly.The housekeeping department were sluggish. They take at least 30 minutes to respond to the simplest of requests, don't replenish the amenties properly, the list goes on.I also noticed that the shower in my suite leaked and the bath-tub was very shoddily sealed. Not to be expected in a fairly new hotel.The Positives:I stayed in an executive suite, which was lovely. It has a great view, much nicer bathroom with a seperate bath and shower, Aigner amenities and a lovely chocolate platter on arrival. The price difference is quite substantial, but it is worth it from a comfort perspective.Room service was great. The presentation, timeous delivery and excellent quality of the dishes impressed me.The spa was also impressive. They offer a wide range of treatments and the staff are friendly and professional.The concierge desk was always very helpful, which I particularly appreciated as it was my first time in Delhi.Location was good. There are a couple of markets nearby, but transport is quite cheap in Delhi so location is not hugely important.CONCLUSIONAll things considered, I will never stay at the Shangri-La again. Their service levels leave much to be desired, and is a Shangri-La in name only. The rest of my trip, we stayed at hotels in the Oberoi group and they are head and shoulders above this hotel in every respect. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"5 star service - 2 star food Firstly - the service was first class. The staff and facilities are great here. We didn't want to risk eating outside the hotel so we had the buffet most nights and tried the A La Carte 2 nights. The buffet was surprisingly poor - like what one might expect from a half-decent high street takeaway, but less tasty - it was bland and cheap-tasting. The a la carte in the restaurant on the 1st floor was alright. We had the Chinese one night and the Thai another night but I've had much better quality Asian food at home for less cost. The Waiter thought we were joking when we said the food was just &quot;ok&quot;. The buffet food actually repeated on me twice during my stay. The table service was very good when required. 5 star service - 2 star food. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"A bit disappointed After having reading all the rave reviews anout Shangri-la, New Delhi, we were left disillusioned with the actual experience.The problems started right from the check-in. We were initially told that there was some problem with their computer system and that we have to wait a while for the room. But after again enquiring 30 minutes later, we were told that no room was vaccant as a guest had requested for a late checkout and they were just checking out that room which would be made available to us in a short while (The time was 6:00pm , well ahead of the standard check-in time of 12:00pm. How can they acceed to such a request when they were fully booked?). To compound the problem, the hotel lobby is woefully short of sitting space. There is only a single couch in whole lobby which may seat at best 7-8 people. The seating did exist on the far side of lobby but as a part of hotel's coffee shop. We did ultimately get the keys to our room after about an hour of waiting.The room was situated on the 11th floor and was of adequate size. The room was pleasant, elegantly furnished and well lit. The bathroom had a see through window but a blind could be lowered for privacy. A plasma TV, which could be seen through the bathroom also, was a nice addition. Though, the channels were rather limited. Bed and duvet were very comfortable. The air-conditioning was fine but the manual setting of temp. control always reverted to the default after some time. Coffee &amp; Tea supplies were not replenished regularily and we had to make repeated calls to get the supplies. The windows overlooked Rashtrapati Bhavan (President of India's official residence) in the distant background.Breakfast was served in Cafe Uno at the lobby level. There was a choice of indoor as well as outdoor seating. The spread was good, consisting of Indian, Chinese and Western cuisine. Service was okay but not exceptional. We had to wait for the omellete (which the chef told will be delivered at the table but had to eventually go and fetch ourselves after 10 minutes), then waited for the ketchup for another 10 minutes.The location is excellent. It is in the city centre, close to the famed Lutyens area of New Delhi (Connaght Place, Parliament, Rashtrapati Bhavan etc.).Overall, during our stay, we felt there was room for improvement in service. It may have been an isolated case, going by earlier reviews (or our expectations may been more because of those same reviews). The hotel itself is top class and exudes a cosy and warm feeling. It can definitely do with a bit more of lounging area in the lobby. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Highly Recommended! I was in India for a friend's wedding last Jan and had stayed at the new Shangri-La New Delhi with my fiance. The hotel property was the usual very nice Shangri-La 5* style. Plasma TV, comfi bed, nice shower etc (see photos). There are also lovely restaurants and bar at the hotel. The selection at the breakfast buffet was excellent - perfect place to try out all the local food if you are worried about the cleaniness on the street. We were actually there over the New Year and the hotel had given us a lovely chocolate plate as welcome amenity. Very nice touch. I'm not quite sure about the location (only know that it's in the city centre) since we always travelled in cars/taxi when we go out anyway. Recommended to all 5* international hotel chain travellers. This hotel will meet your expectations. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"service service service Our travel agent booked us two nights to start our tour of India. Perfect service, nice room, this is a quality hotel. The staff of this hotel has obviously been well trained. The breakfast for wonderful and we had a great dinner in the fine dining room. I had expected dinner to be more costly at a 5* hotel but it was well priced. (it was expenive by Indian restaurant standards) Wine in India is very expensive so stick to beer. A great hotel for either business or pleasure. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Five Star All the Way I visit New Delhi fairly often on business. I have stayed at most of the five star properties in the capital city of India. Shangri-la is the latest addition amongst the five star properties here and it does seem to be a threat to others. The staff, the service right from reception, housekeeping to restaurant and the quality of food served are absolutely top notch. I stayed just for a night in a room on the horizon club floor (17th to 19th). The view from room was fantastic. The airport pick-up was perfect so was check-in. At the time of check-in the front office staff on the club floor would hand in a letter containing the list of services to be offered to a guest in a horizon club room. The room is functional with transparent bathroom with top class amenities (Aigner soap, nail cutter, etc.) Breakfast at club lounge is quiet but filling with choice of hot and cold stuff. For a better spread one would have to visit the ground floor coffee shop. During my entire stay I did not find any fault at all, the staff was always prompt and efficient. Therefore, I am going to return in future and would recommend this place to business travelers for its heart of town location and business facilities within. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,What a Hotel It all started at the airport with the arrival of a wonderful Toyota Camry. While passing the parliament on the way to the hotel the driver called and said we were reaching. A lady was waiting at the door and escorted us to our horizon club room where the check in process was completed. The coffee shop is the best I have eaten at and the lounge facilites are very very good.Overall the best hotel ive stayed at in India after the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton. I would love to stay here again and look no further in the city of Delhi 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Wonderful We had a brilliant time at the Shangri-La. Got a good deal on the internet the night before (£85) a night. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are so helpful. You are treated like royalty! The food in the restaurants is amazing and very cheap compared to UK prices of similar standard, however expensive for India.Our room had a good view of delhi's main attractions and the room was very comfortable and had everything you could possibly need.Beware of the rickshaw drivers who pounce on you as soon as you walk out. We just wanted to go to the ATM across the road and they wanted to take us for 5 rupees! If you use a rickshaw or taxi insist they use their meter. There is a taxi company around the corner if you find the hotel taxis too much.We booked an all day tour of old and new delhi sights at the hotel. It was 900 rupees per person. May have got it cheaper if we had gone to Connaught place where there are more choice of tours but we were short of time. The guide was excellent, the bus was air-conditioned and we really enjoyed it. No matter who you go on a tour with, you will be taken to souvenir shops who give the guides a commision. However we only stayed 20 mins in the shop and had free drinks and no-one minded that we didn't buy anything despite their initial efforts.I would definately stay here again as long as I got a good deal of course! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Loved the Shangri-La Stayed at the Shangri-La for 4 days and it was marvelous!Having stayed in other 5 star hotels in India for work, I wasn't very impressed until I came to the Shangri-La. They definitely kept their standards high. Service was great, the restaurants were fantastic, rooms very chic and modern, and a great location. The hotel grounds although small, were nicely done and it was very quiet even though it was right around the corner from the hub of all of Delhi. Also, after a hot crazy day of sightseeing, shopping etc, it was a delight to come back to our room at the hotel. If i do come back to Delhi, this will be the only hotel i'd stay in. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Great hotel Stayed in the Shangri-La Hotel for 8 days and had a great time. Allthough the hotel is located in the centre of Delhi it is quiet and really an oasis of rest after a stay in the city. The Spa is great, employees are very friendly and helpfull. Food in both restaurants is really good and very safe. Internet connection is also very good.The only minus has been the absence of filter coffee. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Best Sleep Being used to living out of a suitcase &amp; more familiar with airport loungesaround the world than unfortunately my own home, as a business traveller... I've come across a lot of wannbe hotels.After HongKong , this was my second stay at the S La &amp; found the beds to be so comfortable in this new property that without doubt they have invested in probably the best.Good , they do not need to hype it up like the heavenly bed &amp; all .. just understated, chic &amp; subtle.They just need to cut down on the Tariffs but then , I've found most of the Indian Hotels expensive. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Loved It I highly recommend staying here. The staff was extremely courteous and professional. The servers at Cafe Uno knew exactly when you needed a refill on your drink without you having to ask or wave them down. The hotel room was clean and modern with a flat screen tv and you could watch tv thru your bathroom window. The view of Parliament from my room was amazing. I only wish to stay longer than a weekend next time. 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Luxury The Shangri-La Hotel provided a stylish and surprisingly quiet retreat at the center of the city. (And yes, for a price!) Although the featured photo of the hotel isn't too prepossessing in my opinion (I hardly recognized the place), the rooms and lobby are decorated in soothing neutrals, warm woods, and cool stones. Our standard room was comfortable and luxurious, and the service throughout was excellent, with the possible exception of a harried concierge who gave me some misinformation about the National Museum's hours -- perhaps because the primary clientele here seems to be the business traveler. But the staff were consistently friendly and helpful; even over the course of a relatively short stay, the doormen came to recognize us and treated us warmly, and when I expressed a desire for an early lunch during what were, technically, still breakfast hours, the restaurant staff cheerfully obliged. Our two meals at the hotel restaurant, which faces the enclosed garden, were both exceptional. Their Indian selections seemed to reflect a slightly Europeanized or pan-Asian influence in presentation and preparation, but this wasn't watered-down cooking -- the flavors were intense and interesting. There was also an enormous &amp; lavish buffet during lunch, with a range of foods available, including a delectable-looking platter of French cheeses, should you want something non-Indian. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Simply splendid We arrived at the shang-la late at night as our flight was delayed bt checkin was very smooth. The attitude of the staff was excellent even at 2a.m. the had a smile on the face and we happy to answer the few questions that i had. we requested for a late check out and they gave itto us ver willingly. we pair 165US$ ++ for a room and since we are golden circle members we got the horizonclub room which was nice. It had plasma tv in the room. The hotel provides free drinking water(himalayan brand) but do not worry if you are not sure if this brand as they also have evian that comes at a priceThe room is smaller than the rooms at Island shangri-la and so is the bathroom but it was okay i still enjoyed my stay The toiletries in the bathroom was very different from other shangri-la's that i have stayed They have a nail clipper and a shower foam sponge too The bathroom has a window and you can actually watch they other person in the bathroom (not sure why they did it though) but do not fret as there is a blind that you can utalise for your privacy. I was very impressedThe breakfast is like any other shangri-la breakfast buffet - huge variety and if you say you had nothing to eat - i would sya that you are a liar Tried out the orienal avenue restaurant and the food was delicious The beancurd(tofu) was good. However, they did have to make it a little fusion to cater to the local taste buds Tried cafe Uno for the indian food and it was excellent except that the food went cold very fast (spoken to the hotel about it and they are looking in to it)We had pre dinner drinks at the lobby and i found the service there very friendly....the day was veryhot and i had a bleeding nose and the waiter suggested i try fresh lime soda and it did make me feel better.The hotel does have a car that can pick you up at the airport at the price of US$51 - do not freak out at the price as it is a BMW 7 series the latest model The concierge are extremely friendly. My husband bumped his head as we were leaving and they ran and got ice and a towel for him. They have staff everywhere and they are so helpful.......they make you feel like royalty.....jokes aside.This hotel doesn't do indian weddings which is a blessing in a way as they can get extremely noisy with the band and the mare and elephants and all .(i have experienced it at another 5* hotel in new delhi)My overall stay was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.......as for price....well eveything does come at a cost and i would say it was worth every penny. "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Fabulous place - a stylish and efficient refuge We stayed here for the first two nights of our holiday, and again on our last night before flying home. We paid around $167 per room per night inc. breakfast (booked over the internet) and this was absolutely excellent value. The hotel is huge, spotless and attractively designed. There are staff everywhere and they are all extremely helpful; the concierge, porter and door staff are all very efficient. The rooms are a reasonable size and are extremely well designed and equipped (e.g. good lighting, plasma screen TVs, tea and coffee making facilities, fresh fruit plate, plenty of toiletries, towels and robes). The whole place exudes an atmosphere of calm and efficiency - very welcome after a morning or afternoon spent at large in Delhi!The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have encountered, both for the range and the quality of the food on offer. We ate in the 24 hr cafe in the early hours of the morning and the food then was mixed; we had a late snack lunch in the bar and that was very nice. Bar and food prices are high by Indian standards but not by western ones, and certainly not for a hotel of this standard.The hotel is well located, within walking distance of the shops etc. at Connaught Place and also the metro station at Patel Chowk (but note: to reach the first you walk past a long line of stalls and stores - and beggars - all after your business; to reach the second you have to cross a main street through the Delhi traffic, which is a scary experience!). My single word of caution on this place would be: beware the hotel car - we were told a transfer to the airport in it would cost 2200 rupees (just under £30) while a standard taxi, called by the hotel and properly metered, was only 350 rupees. Sure, the hotel's car is nice - but not that nice! Overall, I can't recommend this place highly enough. I was already a fan of Shangri La hotels before my stay (we've used them in Sydney and Singapore before) and I'm an even bigger fan now! "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,"Deffinately lived up to our expecations Stayed here for our first two nights of trip and everything met with our expectations of the Shangri-la Group. Our room(upgraded to a suite)was absolutely fabulous, a real treat when you arrive in the early hours of the morning. Service was friendly, only one reason for not marking it excellent is that it was a little quiet, which could be that it is a new hotel. Can't comment on resturants as we never ate in "
shangri la hotel new delhi ,Absolutely Brilliant Stayed a night at the Shangri la after having spent a terrible night in the Janpath Hotel next door. I would definately recommend the hotel it is absolute luxury your every whim is catered for and they have thought of eveything. It is by far and away the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The only slight negative is the price 
shangri la hotel new delhi ,New Hotel Stayed here Jan 06 and found the hotel very good. The staff and service was very good as well as the food. We usually ordered room service and it was delivered promptly and was very reasonable. The men's health Club is quite state of the art however the women's health club is yet to be finished so that was quite disappointing. Better check if you want the health club facilities for women dont know when this might be completed. Everything else is quite good. Highly recommended.

shanti home ,"A Secure Starting Point for your Trip to India I stayed here as the first of many hotels on a 14 days trip in India. I had booked this hotel since it had a good rating here on Tripadvisor and because I had read that other travellers had received help in putting together a complete itinerary. I may not have been complete firm on where I wanted to go, but the plan that I ended up with backed by help from Shanti Home proved not to be as fantastic as I had hoped for. Moreover, I booked a car with driver to take me through Rajastan for 4 days, which in retrospect proved to be comparatively pricy. Restaurant is good, rooms are nice and clean. Location could be better. Free internet. "
shanti home ,"Excellent hotel in perfect location would recommend! The welcome is one of the best I have ever received. The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The staff on reception helped us to plan a day in Delhi, detailing routes and sites to see, along with how much the transport should cost. The tube is conveniently close and Shanti Home, they even sent someone with us the first time to show us where it is located.The rooftop restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere and delicious food, the staff were again very helpful and met all of our special requests.The rooms are comfy and clean, the only addition which would be nice is a TV in the room. There is however a very comfortable TV room, library, WI-FI and access to a computer with the internet.I would definately recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again in the future! "
shanti home ,"Superb hospitality and assistance We stayed with Shanti Home on four separate ocassions during our recent visit to India. It is located on the west side of Delhi on a residential side street back from the main road and is very convenient for both airport. Husband and wife team Rajat and Sanjana run this hotel and the front desk is headed up by the remarkable Pooja. Thank you Pooja for accomodating us at very short notice (due to a 7-hour train delay which culminated in us missing our flight to Varanasi) and also for re-booking our flights with a &quot;service&quot; charge. We stayed in the following rooms: &quot;Benares&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; and &quot;Oh Calcutta&quot;, the latter being the largest room in the hotel and faces the very busy Jankak Puri road) &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; had a jacuzzi bath. Our favourite rooms were &quot;Benares&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot;, purely because they were a little quieter in the mornings, but hey, you don't come to India for a lie ins do you!The delightful rooftop restaurant serves both Indian and international dishes and food is available 24hrs/day. Food from the tandoor is available in the evenings only. The restaurant staff were charming and services was excellent - chairs lifted in/out for you, fresh tablecloths used each time, torches available for those who needed a little help reading the menu! As well as the large bottles of Kingfisher and iced glasses there was also a selection of local wines - would recommend the Sula sauvignon blanc. This was 1600 rps a bottle - relatively expensive as beverages go, but hey, India is not known for it's wine consumption so it's not surprising and we did pay 1000 rps more for the same thing in Agra!Unfortunately we were not around long enough on each visit to avail of the spa facilites but did use the complementary, modern, internet facility.There is a metro station about a 10 minute walk away and although the metro itself was very clean, I wouldn't advise anyone that doesn't have a very strong constitution (and preferably no sense of smell) to atttempt to walk it!Make no mistake, if/when we are next in Delhi, Shanti Home is where we will be heading to rest our weary heads - it was truly delightful. "
shanti home ,"Comfortable stay The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean - enough hot water. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the rooftop restaurant. The food is good, but plain and we would have enjoyed a bit more variety and more typical Indian food. The staff was very friendly and the managers were attentive. While the metro to Conought place takes about 20 min plus 5 minutes walk to the metro - we found this not too bad, as the metro is clean and efficient. We had to leave early in the morning and good coffee and breakfast even at 4 am ! The owner is very caring and helpful regarding any questions one may have. "
shanti home ,"Awesome Hotel Dear Shanti Home,Once again, THANK YOU! for all your hospitality during our stay, I wish we could have stayed longer!!We arrived in Delhi @ 4:30 AM, and there was a driver waiting for us at the Delhi Cantt train station (I had previously asked which station would be closer to the hotel, and they suggested this one, which is not only 10 minutes away, but very quiet, excellent choice). Upon our arrival, I was expecting that we would have to sit on a lounge or waiting area until a decent check-in time, much to my surprise, they checked us in immediately and led us to our room (which was actually booked for that night), where we were able to rest and clean up.We had a cooking class at the hotel, and it was also memorable, everyone, from the Chef, to the servers was eager to explain what we were doing, and what we prepared we actually ate, and it was amazing!They were very good also guiding us on where to go, the metro station is only a 5 minute walk, and once you get the hang of it, the easiest way to get around to the important places. My wife also had a massage (which she still talks about!!!), and we were able to eat at their restaurant once more and hang out until 10:30 PM when again, a pre-arranged vehicle came to pick us up and take us to the airport.Having stayed at only 4 different places during our time in India, I have to say this was by far the best in service, cleanliness, and friendliness. Thank you again for everything! "
shanti home ,"best boutique hotel shanti home is the best boutique hotel of new delhi.i loved the decor and atmosphere.everything was perfect.food was excellent.a really nice place to stay.amazing experience,warm ambience,nice service.definately a place to come back again.shanti home really made our stay unforgettable and a wonderfulpleasure. "
shanti home ,"Oasis of India My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at Shanti Home and enjoyed it from the first moment. Even though we had arrived very late at night we felt so welcomed. We got helpful tips how to do our sightseeing tour, e.g. what kind of places you should see fist and so on… and the next morning our driver got clear instructions so that we really could lean back and just enjoying our sightseeing tour. The staffs were friendly and helpful all the time without overdoing it. The breakfast and dinner was really delicious and the atmosphere of the roof garden restaurant was so pleasant. The room, we stayed in; the &quot;Bollywood&quot; room was tastefully furnished and it was nice, neat and quiet. The whole Shanti home is an Oasis and it was the best hotel we had stayed in during our 11 days India Journey. So, if you go to New Delhi, it is a must to stay at Shanti Home. "
shanti home ,"Great food! Good service, nice enough rooms - the highlight was the food!! It was absolutely beautiful and in a great setting too! "
shanti home ,"a home away from home..... My partner and I spent a few nights in Delhi and what a nice oasis this is in a very busy city! Friendly and clean place with very helpful and service minded staff, they really do make you feel welcome. Hotel is a short 5 minute walk away from Metro. It takes about 30 minutes into the city center but don't let that scare you off... one day in the center was plenty for us, we got a driever to take us to the sights in the city and belive me, after a day in Delhi this is a nice place to come back &quot;home&quot; to and enjoy a beer or some of their excellent food on their roof top terrace.My only &quot;negative&quot; comment would be that I must be a tad old, he he, as i could have done without the techno music for dinner. (or was it the fact that I expected some Indian background music??) At least the music wasn't too loud!I would absolutely recommend this place as well as stay here again! "
shanti home ,Amazing The driver was waiting with a sign at the train station and we got taken to the Hotel where we were greeted by the most hospitable staff I have ever met. And we had a weekend where we were treated like Queens. The little Hotel is an oasis in the Big Busy City. And it was bliss to come back after a &quot;shopping day&quot; and be feed. The food and the resturant (on the rooftop) is absolutly worth every penny. The ambiance of the whole Hotel is SOOO lovely and homely. The owners have really put there heart into every little detail to make us feel cared for. The rooms were clean and had beautifull art work from around the world displayed. They have a tailor service that is the top of the line in any respect. Internet in every room and one in public area. If you need a local mobil phone you can borrow from reception. A car and driver at your service when you need it and they will arrange any tour for you. The only problem with our stay at Shanti Home was it was too short. Could have moved in there. 
shanti home ,"We felt so looked after by the friendly staff- we couldn't have had a better experinece! This lovely hotel is located a bit away from some of the main tourist spots but that is more than made up for by the comfortable rooms, the great restaurant and the fantastic staff. They sent someone with us to find the metro which is located very nearby so travel was no problem and they also gave great advice in helping us to visit various sites and shops. We had not realised but we were also visiting over Diwali, the festival of lights, and the rooftop terrace was just a perfect place to watch the celebrations and the special dinner for the guests was great. This hotel was defintitely the best of our stay in India. "
shanti home ,"Friendly service modest rooms poor location I organised one week business trip for ten people in Delhi. After the booking, Shanti Home contacted me several times before the trip in order to organise rooms and bus transportation during our stay. The staff in the hotel was very friendly; we got ealier check-in and excellent service in the restaurant with flexible opening hours and menus. The rooms are clean and quite modest: just a bed and a bathroom without any luxury. The best thing in Shanti Home is the friendly service and the weakest point is the location. The location does not matter that much if you just stay for a couple of days, but we stayed a week and ended up spending hours in a bus. The biggest disappointment for us was the bus service. I told beforehand that we need mini-bus transportation for our company meetings and Shanti Home promised to fix it. The bus driver was unfriendly and not at all familiar with business customers. He had difficulties in finding the places and he seemed to delibarately take longer routes. During our free time programme he did not listen to our wishes at all. The whole group felt more or less cheated and the problems with the transportation spoiled much of our trip. I was not satisfied with the way Shanti Home handled our complaiments either.I would recommend Shanti Home for tourists who stay in Delhi for just a couple of days, but not for longer stay or for business people. "
shanti home ,"Just Fantastic! This has to one of the best hotel experiences ever.The Shanti Home is a small (15 room) hotel situated in a quiet road in Janakpuri. It's a fair bit away from the city centre (allow 45 mins or, more realistically, 1 hour) by car but the Metro station is just a 5 minute walk away so you can be in Connaught Place/ New Delhi Station etc in about half an hour so it is, in realoity, as convenient as many other more centrally situated places. However, the Shanti Home is not about location - it's all about ambience, service, friendliness and great facilities. This place is a million miles away from the formulaic international hotel and a great deal more personal and laid back than the myriad of places that have jumped on the boutique bandwagon.Each room is individually designed. Rooms are good sized with all the amenities you would expect, although the wifi can be a bit tempramental. Add to this two nice lounges and a rooftop restaurant serving good food and you have all you need for a confortable stay.However, what really made this place for me was the attitude of all the staff from the owner down. Nothing was too much trouble; everyubody seemed genuinelly determined to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Travel arrangements were made efficiently (and at a good price), good advice was dispensed readilly and the offer of a (very) late check out was made before I even had to ask.We were lucky enough to be staying here over Dewali and the hotel laid on a great party with prayers, fireworks, food and wine all on the house.This is a definite will return to place if I am back in delhi. "
shanti home ,"Shanti Home -- A Calming Experience in Frenetic New Delhi with Wonderful Staff From the initial contact with the hotel requesting a car on short notice, (during the busy Diwali Festival), to the check-in process, to the room, the restaurant and overnight stay, everyone and everything lets you escape the fast pace of New Delhi. You feel as if in your own home, with everything seeming familiar and inviting. Good portions of tasty food at the rooftop restaurant. Everything worked; a slight technical glitch with the internet connection was promptly fixed. Requests to send a fax and print boarding passes were handled with aplomb. The car was clean and the driver was good. Asked for the same car and driver the next day as he knew the location of the office where my meetings were held. Although I had a very brief stay, will certainly stay here again. Only the location keeps Shanti Home from getting an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating. Shanti Home is indeed a peaceful place to stay in Delhi. "
shanti home ,"Good except location had a opporutnity to live here while on a 7 day trip to North India. While service is good, the location is not really convenient to travel to tourist places. Typically takes 1-1.5 hrs and thats not counting the traffic...There is a Hilton coming up somewhere close to this location so would be interesting to experience that too... "
shanti home ,"Another gushing positive review =) I booked this hotel based on the recommendations of other trip advisor reviews, and was thrilled with my experience at Shanti Home. Everything was fantastic: the pick-up service at the airport, the welcome, the a/c in the room, the comfortable bed and clean, well appointed rooms, the dinners and breakfasts, the trip to Agra to see the Taj... The hotel lent me a SIM card which they trusted me to return to them after ten days romping around in India, and even had adaptors ready for me. The free wireless internet is fast and convenient, and the massages offered by their spa (and the steam room) are a great way to relax after a day in crazy Delhi. The ONLY negative of this hotel is the location - plan on at least 1 hour by subway or 1-2 hours by car to find your way anywhere in Delhi. That being said, I wish I had stayed at this hotel on my return to Delhi. I stayed in three separate hotels in Delhi, and this was by far the best value and best experience we had. "
shanti home ,"Shanti Home is an oasis in chaotic New Dehli This boutique hotel is wonderful! Located in a neighborhood, rather than the 'touristy' area, we were able to see what daily life is like. They had day trip suggestions and arranged for everything. Their watch word is, &quot;no problem.&quot; Room Service was speedy and reasonable. The AC was nice and chilly, worked great. The restaurant was lovely and the 'western' breakfast was appreciated...eggs to order, toast, fruit and tea or coffee. ...then, we asked for an 'Indian' dish and they would bring a small sample for us to get our feet wet with the local cuisine. They have plenty of ice cold Diet Coke...a laptop hooked up to the internet to use any time. We were two women traveling alone and always felt safe and secure. "
shanti home ,"Highly recommended! We stayed in india for 10 days, moved around 5 hotels... SHANTI was our most favorite. It has a very cozy unique style, more personal than a big hotel and has the big hotel qualifications. Nice clean rooms, very helpful staff especially at the front desk. A nice restaurant on the rooftop, great food, friendly chef. The hotel has a lounge in each floor with flat screen TV and games to be played by groups. It makes it hard for you to leave the hotel and enjoy the outside. Very peaceful location at the same time a walk away from the metro station and the city buzz. Again, highly recommended. absolutely not one negative comment to say! "
shanti home ,"Amazing place! Amazing staff! Myself and my friend (early 20s females) stayed in Shanti Home for several days at the beginning and end of our month long trip in India. The hotel is beautiful-really, really comfortable with a real Indian decor. There's a licensed rooftop restaurant (quite rare in smaller hotels/restaurants), amazing lounges with flatscreen t.v and dvds and FREE internet on a laptop!! Also, there's a mini spa with massage, pedicures etc. We arrived in India knowing where we wanted to go but had nothing booked - the owner Rajat sat down with us for about two hours and booked all our trains and flights after advising us the best places to go-for this we are indebted to him as otherwise we'd had a lot of wasted time and frustration! ALL the staff there are so lovely-friendly, helpful and chatty. They all went the extra mile to help us feel as much at home as they could-they told us loads about them and their lives and helped us booked trips, hairdressers, places to go - one guy even walked us to the local metro station and paid for our ticket on our first day there!! The other owner Sanjana even called us after trip to see how we got on! We can't recommend Shanti Home enough - a really lovely place to stay and people who make your trip so memorable. Big hello to Sanjana, Rajat and Pooja!Claire and Maria - Ireland "
shanti home ,"Shanti Home is a Refuge As a first-time visitor to India, arriving between 3 and 4 in the morning after a long flight to Delhi, I was so comforted to see a man holding a sign with my name and “Shanti Home Welcomes You “. I was whisked to the Guest House and shown graciously to my large, clean, and very beautiful AC room. Late the next day Room Service brought me hot coffee and breakfast. We loved the roof top terrace restaurant where the chef will devise extraordinary specials just for you 24 hours per day. With its great comforts, incredible staff, and quiet location, I would recommend Shanti Home to anyonebut a strictly budget traveler. We loved it for 8 days… "
shanti home ,"A wonderful boutique hotel My husband and I had two stays at the hotel and felt at home the minute we got there.The hotel is in a residential suburb where you can see everyday life going on. It is near a busy road but even the front rooms facing the road have double glazing so noise is not a problem. It makes a pleasant change from the large hotels in the city.The staff are ever so helpful and friendly and assisted us with tips of where to shop and gave us maps. There is a good shopping mall/cinema complex only 10mins drive in an auto rickshaw which was also a great experience. We walked to the Metro (5mins) and were in Connaught place in the heart of the city in 1/2 hour. The two rooms and bathrooms were excellent and the food at the rooftop terrace was delicious. Thank you to Pooja, Adil, Raj, Tul and all the staff. "
shanti home ,A home away from home My new born son and I stayed at the Shanti Home hotel for three weeks during August. Our circumstances were such that we could not visit tourist sites and were pretty much house bound. The management and staff at the hotel made our stay as comfortable as possible. It was exceptional service. Having travelled to India now many times with work and privately I have stayed in many establishments from luxury five star to overrated three star hotels. The Shanti Home is by far the best value for money hotel that I have stayed at. We will be back for sure. 
shanti home ,"Number one for a reason How to describe what Shanti Home is; reading some of the reviews, it is labeled as fantastic, great, must-stay, the best of India, etc. In a short way, what people said about this hotel is true, it is an excepcional place to stay in, but amidst everything I have read, there are a few things missing that I would like to share with everybody. I know it is hard to read so many reviews, which is why I suggest to check the video I made and edited that describes all the great things about Shanti Home; this is the only place I would do it for, in large part because what I treasure the most, is the human touch behind Shanti and it’s the least I could do for Rajat for being such a great guy. Go to photos and videos to check it out.The greatness of the hotel lies within the personal touch and the value of human relations as a way to win your heart; most big chain or luxury Hotels “try” this but you and I know it never feels as genuine, but here it does. The food, rooms, service, etc is exceptional but it is this human care the pillar as to why so many people enjoy it, myself included. There isn’t the amount of amenities that a Taj chain might be able to supply you, but that doesn’t matter, you will not need them. The rooms are clean, staff is fantastic, they help you with anything and Ahil, the chef, is a genious. I would seriously bring him here to my country and open an Indian restaurant if I could.Pooja, Rajat and Shanjana are th eones who hold this place together; the hotel is a bit far off Delhi, but it doesn’t matter, it is a great place. I hope you enjoy my video review and I hope you found it helpful. "
shanti home ,"very sweet place amazingly helpful and friendly staff! I stayed at the Shanti home a couple times during my stay in India. When you walk in the staff is there to welcome you with smiles, a flowers and a welcome drink. The ambience of the entire hotel is very peaceful and inviting. Pooja was so helpful with arranging transport and allowed me to leave luggage stored safely at the hotel for a month while I traveled around the country! The rooftop restaurant was excellent and the service very attentive! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly be back the next time in India! "
shanti home ,"The Best Hotel in India We were referred to the Shanti Home when initially planning our trip to India. We wanted to go all over Rajasthan and to Mumbai. They planned the entire three week trip for us. It was the best trip we've ever taken and surpassed all of our expectations. The Shanti Home, itself, is fabulous. The rooms are spacious and modern and the staff is extremely friendly. Our stay included many personal touches that made our experience extra special -- flowers on arrival, a welcome sign in our room, complimentary massages, and personal attention at the complimentary and tasty breakfast. Also, as an added bonus, the food in the restaurant was the best we had in all of India! AND - They invited us to eat our dinner in their TV room (comfortable couches, flat screen TV) while watching a Bollywood movie -- it was so much fun! Overall, we'd highly recommend this hotel to ANYONE considering a stay in India. "
shanti home ,"They go more than the extra mile We had 2 nights stay here - one at the beginning and one at the end of a motorbike trip over the Himalayas. On arrival at the hotel after pick-up following a night flight and very jaded, I discovered that I had picked up the wrong baggage off the carousel at the airport - oops - well they all look the same! Didnt faze the staff at all - they arranged a car and driver back to the airport to help out with the HUGE amount of paperwork involved in claiming the correct bag. Back to the hotel for a wonderful massage to calm down. After the bike trip we arrived at 10 at night with back muscle spasms following a suspect cracked rib after falling off the bike on a mountain pass. Immediately they arranged for a doctor who prescribed pain killers, they provided a hot water bottle whilst someone went out to get the pills and would not take a penny for it all. What can you say about that level of service? Cannot recommend this gem of a place highly enough - the staff are just superb. Thanks a million. "
shanti home ,"True service from the heart!! Incredible Shanti!! From the time we checked in till we departed after a 3 night stay we experienced true service. It is not a five star hotel but i assure you the service is better than any i have stayed at..and i have stayed at many. The food at the rooftop restaurant, the massage in the Spa and just lounging about in the lounges. It was a haven from the mad mad city that is Delhi and every evening we looked forward to getting back to Shanti Home. "
shanti home ,"Best hotel experience throughout the trip After several hours of air travel and a late night arrival, it was a welcome relief to come 'home' to Shanti Home. In the bustle and commotion of Delhi, Shanti Home, though a bit set back from the airport, is a true sanctuary. The staff was incredibly welcome, friendly and a comfort as a lone female traveler waiting for my friend to arrive the next day.Shanti Home was the first stop on a whirlwind month-long tour of North-Western India. That said, I had the opportunity to experience several (roughly eleven different 'luxury' hotels around India) and Shanti Home provided the best experience, food, staff, accommodations, far and away. I only wish I was able to stay longer.The staff was incredibly accommodating and I had the best tandoori chicken of my trip here. The Shanti Home also organized my trip throughout India. My main contact, Pooja, was responsive and everything went as smoothly as possible. I would certainly recommend Shanti Home to others and look forward to returning in the future. "
shanti home ,"Nice place...but location matters!! No doubt this place is nice and very clean, but....1. Delhi is a huge city (around 17 million people live there) and staying at Shanti Home will make you loose hours stuck in traffic jams or spending your afternoons on the metro, as this hotel is in Janakpuri, a suburb which is about 25 stops from Connaugt Place and most places of interests (and add a 10 minute walk in the middle of nowhere to reach the Uttam Nagar Eaest tube station from the hotel). If you have dinner in central Delhi getting back to the hotel can become a nightmare...no taxi driver knows where it is and all they can do is heading to Janakpuri and starting to ask everyone if they know a place called &quot;Shanti Home&quot;...on hour second night it took us almost 2 hours to reach our bed!2. Shanti Home is ridiculously pricey for Indian standards!! A standard room at a 5 star chain hotel (Oberoi, Lalit, Taj, etc...) does not cost much more than one of the best rooms at Shanti Home (a luxury room at Shanti Home is about RS 12.000 per night, while you can get a room at the Oberoi or similar places for around Rs 16.000, which will mean utmost luxury in the best places in town and not just a nice room in Janakpuri). I frankly don't understand why some reviews refer to &quot;good value for money&quot;...3. To be honest I think that those who call Shanti Home &quot;a boutique hotel&quot; have never stayed at a boutique hotel in their lives...warm welcome and decent rooms are not enough to make a boutique hotel. Have a look at the wash rooms in one of the luxury rooms at Shanti Home and I am sure you will not call them &quot;boutique&quot; (although they are very clean). Plus, I don 't think a &quot;boutique hotel&quot; can be without air conditioned in the common areas....getting out of our room was like entering a oven!!!4. Food is ok but nothing to dream about and the roof terrace is cute but, again, nothing special.In a word, Shanti Home is highly overrated and overpriced in relation to its location and to Indian standards. "
shanti home ,"A true gem in the middle of Delhi Like its name suggest Shanti Home has the quality of making you feel both at home and at peace in the midst of New Delhi's hustle and bustle. The staff is amazing, kind and professional; rooms are clean and beautifully organized. At time it felt as if the hotel became one of New Delhi's tourist attraction for me! When staying there do not skip any opportunity to eat in their rooftop restaurant. Beyond the amazing food it is also a very nice place to sit and relax. If you need to further deepen the Shanti feeling, do not leave before treating yourself with an Ayur-Vedic massage. By far the best thing about Shanti Home is the people who run the place, they will look for you and will help to make your trip in India a safer and easier experience. Enjoy your trip! "
shanti home ,"Shanti Home - Our Delhi home away from home We arrived in New Delhi with my sister, myself and my partner, and our newborn twin girls (7 days old!), to be greeted by extremely friendly staff, who were more than happy to take care of the girls while we sorted out the paperwork, and got ourselves relaxed after a very stressful time in Mumbai after the birth of the twins.It was an absolute joy to be able to relax in the beautifully furnished rooms, with staff on hand to help us with the girls as needed. They even let us rearrange the furniture in the room to a more suitable layout for us all - and were more than happy to fulfil our requests for a microwave and fridge in the room ... it was already there when we arrived!!! (We were there for 10 days afterall ...)The rooftop restaurant is a MUST!!! Head-chef Adil and his staff have created quite an extensive menu of beautiful food ... and were more than happy to accommodate our &quot;comfort food&quot; requests when we needed it. We can highly recommended the butter chicken, garlic naan and the tandoori lamb skewers ... Yummy!Sanjana and Rajat have staffed the hotel with a crew of extremely friendly and helpful staff. Nothing was too much bother for any of them ... and the staff all went out of their way to make our stay as peaceful and relaxing as possible.We highly HIGHLY recommend The Shanti Home for anyone staying in New Delhi. It's our new home away from home ... "
shanti home ,"Amazing find...worth the credit its gettings This place is an amazing place to stay, considering Delhi hotels and the word 'value' don't often feature in the same sentence! Top service (many of the staff are Nepali), beautifully decorated, clean and very nice food on the roof top restaurant.Only trouble I had was arriving late at night, the normal access road to the hotel is blocked but a locked gate and taxis need to go down a series of back streets to get there....my driver took a very long time to figure this out, and only after driving up and down the main road for over an hour asking people.Don't let that put you off...its stunning "
shanti home ,"Human Warm Authentic Good Value The seond time I stayed at the property, and I would go back again. I like the people very much, the rooms are big and clean and quiet, and the food is always good. I actually went back and stayed two more nights before I left India, and will stay there again next trip. This is an excellent value and does everything the big hotels do with a friendly touch. It's set in a residential quarter, so you see reality, not touristy stuff. And I never once saw a dog. "
shanti home ,Outstanding Delhi Boutique Hotel My husband and I travelled to Delhi in April and we stayed 3 nights at the Shanti Home. I have written a review because I was extremely dissapointed to learn of a past review which stated the owners dog bit a guest. I find this extremely difficulty to believe as the owner and staff were nothing short of consummate professionals and it is unimaginable the owner had a large dog in the hotel.Here are all the positive qualities of the hotel:1. Clean and trendy decorated rooms2. Common rooms were beautifully decorated in local decor3. Restaurant on the roof top served incredible Indian cuisine with outstanding service4. The best of all was the staff. They were always helpful in arranging plans and providing sound advise. The only negative comment I can make is that the location was not central but this is not important as the air conditioned metro line is a block away and the hotel makes safe and secure transport arrangements if you require a car.I would highly recommend this boutique hotel to any one travelling to Delhi 
shanti home ,"Impressed once again Had a pleasure of once again staaying in Shanti Home during my short weeknd visit to Delhi. Shanti team were all delighted to see me as I was to once again see them.I got my favorite room when I arrived 3Am in the morning and the warmth of the team at 3am was exceptional. All needs were answered, warm cup of team before I went for my much needed beauty sleep, massage the next day and overall a fantastic stay.Chef Adil lived up to the mark and delivered the long craved for kebabs and nan which I needed to settle me in.Love it and looking forward to my next visit before the year ends. "
shanti home ,"A jewel in India Ignore the review after this and be guided by majority of great reviews. This is a truly wonderful hotel - one of the best I have ever stayed in, right up there with the Eastern and Oriental!As a single female traveller they looked after me from the moment I landed in Delhi. All arrangements were as promised and very professional. When I arrived at the hotel, (which is beautiful!) I was given a refreshing drink in the hotel reception before being taken to my room. The rooms are utterly gorgeous. So romantic - it seemed a waste that I was there alone!They have free internet and a fantastic restaurant on the rooftop where I was made a great fuss of and had some delicious meals. Pooja who runs the hotel is an absolutely lovely person and can't do enough to ensure you have a good stay.In fact, as I write about it, I am missing it all over again and would go back tomorrow! Do stay here, you won't regret it and it will be one of the highlights of your trip. "
shanti home ,"stay away - the owner's dog attacked me at the reception desk - rabies and tetanus shots for me :(( This is a nice-looking hotel with nice rooms, but when I stayed here the owner's dog bit me while in the hotel reception. Really, it is a massive dog and it jumped up on my shoulders and tried to bite my face. I put my hand up to stop it and it chomped down on me. It was an unprovoked attack. What was the dog even doing there in the first place? Would you stay here if you had kids or family? I think not. Avoid this hotel at all costs.Rajit the owner told me not to worry about the bite as his dog had been vaccinated (!). Of course, as soon as I got home my doc recommended rabies and tetanus shots - 9 injections over 30 days. Great. And I have a mauled hand too, thanks to Rajit and his dog.My main gripe about this place is that the owner Rajit had no concern for my welfare and didn't check at the time to see if i was ok. He then gave me a crappy US$30 discount on the bill, but it's not the money. I really was appalled by his lack of concern at the incident. I had to ask him to come out of his office to discuss it. Stay somewhere else that doesn't have a crappy owner and [--] dogs in the foyer. "
shanti home ,Clean and Tranquil in the heart of Delhi. Better food than all the 5* places we went in India! This was such a lovely place to stay at the start of our honeymoon. The staff are fantastic - they can't do enough and are lovely people. The rooms are beautiful and lovely and cool - with crisp clean sheets. The location is fine as Delhi is manic wherever you stay I think. The food really was fantastic - we stayed in some other 5* hotels in India during our trip and the food on the Lantern terrace was wonderful in comparison. It tastes of real India - you can taste the spices without them being overwhelming. The only thing we wished we asked for a change with was the car service around- we really would rather have had the hotel agree a higher daily rate not to have been driven to various shops - where you are coxed to buy things and forced upon various guides. But that wasn't really the fault of the hotel just something I think they could do for travellers to improve their stay. Overall we really loved it and would definately stay there again. 
shanti home ,"Best hotel in new delhi Welcoming, clean and comfortable. "
shanti home ,"Ah... Air Conditioning... Like many others, I needed a place to stay when arriving late and leaving early. This worked very well. Hotel was clean, comfortable (rooms were a bit small), great price, and -super air conditioning-. After a bad flight and a dose of Delhi heat, the AC was just what I needed to get some sleep. "
shanti home ,Comfortable Shanti Home Having arrived late and leaving early the next morning we had a very short but comfortable stay at stylish Shanti Home. While it is reasonably expensive by Indian standards it is an attractive property with large rooms and very comfortable beds. It is also convenient for the airport if you have an early / late flight (c. 45 minutes drive from International / c. 20 mins to Domestic). 
shanti home ,"Our best accommodation in India Shanti Home was truly like a home away from home. All the staff were well informed and could help you aquire anything you needed from directions to tailoring, from site seeing to shopping. It was a wonderful, quiet, relaxing hotel with the best food we experienced in India. I'd like to go back to New Dehli just to stay there!!! "
shanti home ,"A Boutique hotel with the family staff to match! We flew from Mumbai to New Delhi with our newborn twins and really needed to be somewhere that was quiet, comfortable and service driven. We could not have been more delighted. The rooms were all simple, classy, classic Indian colonial style. Beds were big an comfy. Bathrooms big and hot hot showers. Staff went shopping to help us with all our baby supplies and we ate on the stunning rooftop restaurant every night. They organized cars to take us around the city, and the drivers were all classy gentlemen who looked after us. I can't recommend Shanti more highly. The attention to service, the warm but discreet staff made our stay memorable and Delhi a real treat!!! "
shanti home ,"It is as good as the majority of reviewers say! We stayed in the Shanti home on 10th and 11th April 2009. This is a lovely hotel. The staff are very attentive and do everything they can to help. The room was very clean and comfortable and the lounges are equally clean with great couches to relax on after the bustle of a day in Delhi. The decor throughout is beautiful.We were in India for 2 weeks and had some really nice meals throughout, but still none quite matched our first dinner here at the Shanti Home!While the hotel is not near the City centre (thank goodness) the Metro stop is just around the corner and easily he best way into the City. Quick, clean and an opportunity to meet the locals.Undoubtedly there are cheaper hotels available, but this is an excellent hotel and worth every rupee. "
shanti home ,"Deserves its number one TA rating This hotel was the first stop in our two week trip around Rajasthan and we just loved it.Pick up after a long flight was as arranged and when we got to the hotel at about 11a.m. we were so pleased that our room was ready. As referred to in previous reviews Puja is an extremely charming and welcoming hostess. Our room was spotless, had a great bathroom and the air con worked beautifully. The bedrooms on our floor were set around a very large well decorated and appointed lounge area. This had free internet , big squashy sofas and lots of books and mags. The roof terrace was also lovely but abit hot during the day.Dinner on the rooftop was a delight. The friendly chef came over and had a chat. We then told him what we would like to eat ( A , B and C) and he said , OK I'll give you D,E and F!! Needless to say his recommendations were spot on and the food was fantastic.The following morning , after a hearty breakfast the hotel's car took us off the the railway station for our train to Agra. We would highly recommed this lovely spot , Puja and her team do an awsome job at looking after guests from around the world and of course running a lovely charming hotel "
shanti home ,"Island of Tranquility We checked into the Shanti Home on the day of our arrival in Delhi for one night and again for one night a week later. We pre-arranged our airport transportation as well as a city transfer through the hotel, the cost of which was added to our bill, a big convenience. Our air conditioned room was clean and comfortable The only meals we had at the hotel were the included breakfasts which included a variety cereals, pastries and eggs cooked to order. The hotel is situated on a residential side street though is close enough to the main street that the incessant honking of vehicle horns can be heard in the distance. The hotel has a computer and printer available to guests which we found handy as we were able to print out our boarding passes for the next day's flight. We found that given the quality of the accommodations the price was quite reasonable for Delhi. "
shanti home ,Relaxing and comfortable stay We made a recent trip with our 2 children and were pampered during the stay. The rooms were spacious and clean. The staff were very professional and attentive. The 24/7 restaurant was exceptional and convenient.This was one of the most pleasant experiences during our several trips to India. Would highly recommend Shanti Home. 
shanti home ,"Disappointing We stayed at the Shanti Home for a week in February which we chose based soley on the Trip Advisor reviews.We had arranged for the hotel to send someone to pick us up from the airport but they did not show up. Ordinarily this would not be aproblem but Delhi is probably the worst place in the world for this to happen.The staff were nothing short of superb and the food in the restaurant was delicious albeit quite expensive.The room was ok certainly not worth the money we paid. However the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in!I had some shirts tailored and the quality of these was nothing short of poor, I would not advise getting anything done by the tailor.The hotel does not accept American Express.All in all it was ok, but for the price, especially in India, it was extremely disappointing. "
shanti home ,"A lovely oasis of calm in the chaos of Delhi This is a very comfortable and friendly hotel with good sized, well furnished en-suite rooms. Our room and bathroom were kept spotlessly clean and all the public areas were equally well looked after. There is a pleasant roof top restaurant for breakfast or dinner and a round -the-clock room service menu - excellent in a small hotel like this. The hotel gives you free internet access ( we were charged up to 150rps per half hour elsewhere) and there is generally a really helpful atmoshere. We were upgraded to a better room without asking and the fact that we checked in at 3.30 am didn't seem to phase anyone (except me).The only snag and it seems churlish to mention it is that the hotel isn't particularly central - and Delhi is huge with very slow traffic. If you want to be right in the centre of the city look for somewhere else, if the location isn't too critical and you want a to stay somewhere pleasant and different to the chain hotels then try the Shanti Home. "
shanti home ,"Friendly Service with a Smile From my initial enquiry through to our departure from the Hotel the service we received was excellent. This is a little way out of New Delhi but the hotel is very clean, and comfortable. We stayed in the Oh Calcutta room which was large with a nice sized bathroom. We arrived early morning on the day of the Holi Festival and were treated as part of the Shanti Home &quot;family&quot; for the duration of the festivities.The rooftop restaurant provided excellent tandoori meals with a chef who was prepared to spend time discussing his recipes and techniques.Overall we spent an excellent two days at the hotel, the only disadvantage being the time to travel into Delhi Centre. "
shanti home ,"Highly Reccomended! Great food, great service, everyone was friendly, rooms were spacious and clean with comfortable beds. I couldn't have been happier with my stay. "
shanti home ,"Wonderful Hotel...assuming you don't mind a Metro Ride. I was in India for about a month in February 2009 and stayed at Shanti Home on two different occasions for about 3-4 days. I found the hotel to be absolutely clean and the staff to be helpful and courteous. The food was surprisingly good as well. I had the lamb and chicken kabob (served with Dal Makhni) as well as a Chicken curry dish in addition to the free breakfast provided...and enjoyed it all. The food is a bit costly (but delicious), though the beer is cheaper than other hotels I stayed at. The rooms are nice and large and the bathrooms are clean and well taken care of (I stayed in Goa and Benarus). I had absolutely no issues contacting the hotel prior to arriving and was well taken care of. It might be in your interest to organize a taxi ride through SH (despite it being more expensive than the airport taxis) as I feel the Delhi prepaid taxis might have some trouble finding the Hotel. The only issue with the Hotel that is quite far from Central Delhi. The metro station is close (5 min walk) and rides are cheap, but it will still take 20-30min to get to Connaught. The internet is free, but not especially fast. I found that all the guests at the hotel were non-Indian and had wonderful conversations with many of them about what they had seen and done in India. This is one of the nicer places I stayed in India out of maybe 10 or so Hotels. I highly recommend it despite the poor location. There is also a bit of road noise, but I did not find it to be an issue. "
shanti home ,"STAY HERE! A Slice of heaven My wife and I were planning on staying in Delhi for one day before starting a loop through Agra and Jaipur ultimately ending up at Ranthambore national park. We had already been traveling through India for a week and had been through a couple of rough hotel experiences. We arrived at the Shanti home and immediately felt comfortable. Within an hour we decided we would stay another day. Then the next day we decided to stay another week. We liked the hotel so much that in the end we changed our entire itinerary and just did day trips to Jaipur and Agra and basked in the brilliance of the trip advisers that had gone before us.The staff is second to none. Polite and helpful are serious understatements. A+The rooms, because of our ad-hoc stay at Shanti Home, we changed rooms 3 times (because the place was booked), so we saw several of the rooms. The are all tastefully appointed and extremely comfortable. The only complaint we had was that the hot water heaters are small and in each room. This means that you only have about 5-7 minutes of hot water before it is gone. Once we figured this out, it was not a big deal. Overall - AThe restaurant was fantastic! We ate there several meals and each was delicious. I think we tried the majority of the menu and didn't find a single item that we did not like. By the end of our stay, we would just tell the chef to pick our meals for us because you couldn't go wrong. They will go very easy on the spice unless you tell them that you enjoy it. Overall A+The location is a mix. On one hand you are in a relatively peaceful area and away from the craziness of Delhi. On the other hand, you are away from the craziness of Delhi. The good news is that there is a metro station (the metro is brand new, clean and people are much more polite than any metro I have been to) less than a 1/4 mile away. The downside is that you have to walk through a pretty nasty market area to get there. It is by no means dangerous, but it can be a little unpleasant. The Shanti Home offered to have an escort go with us to the metro station, but we felt no need. It is well worth it though as a metro ticket will get you anywhere in Delhi for 15 rupees. Overall A-I cannot recommend Shanti Home enough. I would tell anyone going to Delhi to stay here. It may not be the mega-luxurious hotel that a Taj might be, but rupee for rupee the best hotel I have experienced in all of my travels (and my wife agrees). "
shanti home ,"Perfect Little Hotel We were delighted with this hotel. We arrived in the early hours of the morning and were greeted by very helpful and friendly staff. Our room, Kashmir, was very nicely furnished with a very comfortable, large double bed. The marble bathroom was effectively a wet room with a lovely powerful shower, albeit the water did go everywhere before draining away. Breakfast was served on the lovely roof terrace and there was an excellent choice. We also opted to have dinner there which was delicious. Our meal was freshly cooked infront of us in the open kitchen and the Tandoor oven. This was one of the best meals we had during our entire stay in Rajasthan. After dinner the owner came to chat to us and we took the opportunity of finding out about Indian wine. He recommended Sula Sauvignon Blanc and Grover Estates Cabernet Shiraz, both of which were on the hotel's comprehensive wine list and were not that expensive either.After dinner we made use of the very comfortable lounge to watch a DVD. On another floor there was also internet access and a small kitchenette for general use. The hotel is also just around the corner from the newly opened Metro station. This was a real plus as the journey time into the centre of Delhi was about 30 minutes compared to over an hour by road in the rush hour. All the staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful and their help was greatly appreciated in resolving a problem we had with another hotel reservation. We thought this hotel was exceptional value for money and won't hesitate to stay there again. "
shanti home ,"A stunning place to stay in! This hotel is in a gated residential suburb area with a nearby gym, a new school and upper middle class flats.I had food poisoning when I was in Jaipur. When I arrived at the hotel with my mother, I stayed in the hotel room recovering whilst mum had supper in the restaurant. She enjoyed the food immensely and was surprised when the hotel manager/owner remembered that I was ill and suggested that I have hot chocolate so that the milk could line my stomach. That definitely worked. The service was excellent. The chef was an excellent cook! I had a cookery lesson with him and wrote down the ingredients and the steps needed to make his chicken curry sauce :) We ended up having the dahl and chicken curry for lunch. It tasted great!There is a living room with luxurious sofas and armchairs, a large flat screen tv with a dvd player, dvds for you to watch and space for you to learn how to play the indian guitar (s-tar?). There is a library on the upper level with beautiful sofas for you to lounge on and read the books. This is where the free Internet is found. There is also a kitchen if you would like to make something of your own. Even better, this hotel was not far from the new Metro station stop. This enabled us to quickly reach the city centre and go shopping. Whatever we needed, it was done. A taxi was booked to pick us up from the train station at about 10pm. We also hired a driver and car to take us to Agra. We had an Indian Aruveya massage and I found this weird. The woman will massive everything and I mean everything. If you do not like this, then you must tell the woman what not to massage! I would have given this a 5* rating but unfortunately, I found this hotel just too expensive for/by Indian standards. I would not pay this amount for the kind of hotel it is as I can find a cheaper hotel elsewhere in another country and still pay a cheaper rate, yet have a very good service at the same time. The owner knows that we, as tourists, are willing to pay for higher prices because of its reputation.Our bathroom in our deluxe room 'Pushtkar' needs upgrading. The cupboard was older than the hotel itself!Apart from the exellent service, the only thing that was free was the Internet. The hotel owner should offer free pick ups or complimentary drinks upon arrival. The funny thing is that if I stayed at a 5* hotel in Delhi, I'd be paying for the same price as Shanti's. Shanti Homes knows that it is the best hotel in all of Delhi. The prices should be dropped a little bit. Overall, I had a wonderful time and enjoyed this hotel more than any of the hotels I had stayed at while in India. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. "
shanti home ,"Liked this place I have spend 3 nights in the beggining of our stay in India and then last 2nights. The hotel is very clean, cuisine delicious, the staff in reception is very helpful.We have arranged the driver befor our arrival, with whom we spent 10days.He was an exellent driver, not disturbing at all, always smiling...The only thing I didn´t like was the massage and steam bath. Massage isn´t professional, and they switched on the steam few mins before I went in, so the seat was cold and there was not enough steam as it should be. "
shanti home ,Full service hotel and real value for money Stayed here for four nights and enjoyed every moment of it. Outstanding service and great insider information on what to see and where to go in delhi.The staff went above and beyond to insure we were comfortable.Food at the roof top restaurant was amongst the best meals we had in India. We will surely be back. 
shanti home ,"Amazing Service By far, one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. From the greeting to the meals and impeccable service, I was made to feel like a VIP visiting family. It's a full service hotel with staff willing to meet any and all needs you have, whether it's a special birthday cake or henna tattoo artist, they'll make it happen.I can't imagine staying anywhere else whenever I am in New Delhi!! "
shanti home ,"Great Hotel with great service and an awesome cook. Very nice place in what seems like a sketchy neigborhood, but safe because of the staff. The service is the most impressive thing about it, but the rooms and the bathrooms were all good. "
shanti home ,"Great staff food and rooms The Shanti Home was a great place to stay. The staff was warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful. They really made the Shanti Home feel like home. The rooms were comfortable and clean. We really enjoyed dining on the rooftop- great food! I'd definitely stay here again! "
shanti home ,"would do anything to visit again !! Had stayed in Shanti Home , it was a new India for me and my family . Great experience . Very Friendly people!! Recommend to stay in Shanti Home while in Delhi but not anywhere else !!!! "
shanti home ,"Wonderful service and great restaurant Although this is not a central location, the service is excellent and the restaurant first rate (turn your palate over to the chef, and you won't be sorry!) Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the reception floor, so it was a little noisy, but reception is being moved to the lower level, so that should be solved. Staff was very professional and very friendly, even though we were three hours late and arrived at 2:00 a.m. Hotel will arrange for airport pick-up for a very reasonable fee; don't pay the driver, as it is added to your hotel bill.Single and/or older women will be very comfortable here and will feel safe. The owner will visit with you at dinner and make sure that things are to your satisfaction.I had also stayed at a high-end hotel in Delhi, but Shanti Home was more to my liking. "
shanti home ,"Overated Shanti HomePros:-Food Great-Service GreatCons;-Rooms need repairs, paint peeling, water damage and lots of broken bits. My room &quot;Bollywood&quot; (a so called premium room) had a broken jacuzzi in it and never enough water to even fill it as a normal bath.Location is a long long way from center of Delhi.Bottom line for me is this place was way overrated on TripA. "
shanti home ,"wonderful staff large rooms great food wondeful place to stay, a little outside of town, but well worth it.had to leave for agra at 3:00 am in the morning, and the staff made me a full breakfast before I left.the owner made me a special dinner meal for dinner the night before because my stomach was a little unsettled.they run their place like a 5 star hotel, all so friendly, can not say enough "
shanti home ,"I Wish I Could Live There Again a litle late in writting this but we went there in Dec 08 and let me say that it was fantastic. It was sparkingly clean, the staff were extremly friendly and couldnt do enough to make our stay welcome. Its conviently located next to the metro - so travel into delhi is very easy.If you dont stay here then your missing out. "
shanti home ,"The reviews are right The reviews were exactly right -- warm, embracing, comfortable, rooftop restaurant quite fine and carefully maintained for visitors from abroad. The one drawback is the distance from town if you are traveling by car; but the metro is half a kilometer away or less, and avoids Delhi's awful traffic. So have them bring you from and take you to the airport, and then use the train and taxis from in town to get around.The setting perfectly captures Delhi's contrasts. The hotel itself is on a quiet side street, little noise and pleasant walking. By the time you get to the metro you are in the heart of teeming Asia, rickshaws, street markets, noise and all. "
shanti home ,"Listen.... I'll say this only once - if you want the best - STAY HERE !! The reviews of other travellers extoll the virtues of this particular Hotel - the owners and staff treat you as family not guests. Firstly - I need to apologise - I stayed here in Oct 08 and I'm slightly late in detailing how the Hotel made my stay one of the best experiences in India I've ever had. Don't waste your time looking at other establishments - you've stumbled across one of the better places to stay - and don't be afraid of booking direct with the Hotel - the owner personally will respond.I can recommend the accomodation, the food, the staff and the service - if you want to feel at home in India and adopt a family this is the place - FAULTLESS.Thanks to the Owners, the Chefs, Waiters and Manager for a truely extra-special stay - I look forward to seeing you all on my next visit - and I've had no hesitation in recommending you to both my Company and our Clients - thanks Neil Boot. "
shanti home ,"Great hotel with great service! Each room is decorated according to a different part of India, and the whole hotel is geared towards making your stay in New Delhi as easy and enjoyable as possible. The staff will arrange for you to be picked up and dropped off at the airport. You can also arrange sightseeing trips or the staff will make recommendations for things to see/do. You can even get a facial or massage at the hotel. While there are no TVs in the rooms, there is a big flatscreen TV on the second floor that anyone can use. The wireless internet could be a little off and on, but there is a computer available for use. The hotel even offered phones for use while traveling around the city. The food at the rooftop cafe is delicious and the waitstaff were constantly making sure you had what you needed. Overall, I would definitely recommend the hotel to others! "
shanti home ,"Gastronomical height During our trip to India and Bhutan we stayed 4 days in Hotel Shanti Home in New Delhi. The staff was very friendly and helpful, The rooms were good bud not exceptional. The kitchen was OUTSTANDING. It is a pity that the area is not so beautiful.Dutchie Antwerpen Belgium "
shanti home ,"It was like coming home! What can we say about Shanti Home? We had the best time ever in India and it was all due to Sanjana in Shanti Home. By email we agreed on the itinerary for our three and a half week honeymoon in India. It was over Christmas 2008 and New Year 2009. All of the hotels suggested by Shanti Home were great! The car, the driver (Dimple), the efficiency (everywhere we went there was someone to meet us), was top class!! But nothing was as good as Shanti Home itself. Whether this is due to the staff, the rooms, the restaurant (best food in India!), the service, the smiles, the welcome, the welcome cake which was served at 4am in the morning(!), the love poems left on the bed every evening, the answering of calls at 10pm at night (thanks Pooja) it is hard to say. But all we know is that coming back to Shanti Home mid way through the holiday and at the end of the holiday was like coming home. And that is an amazing thing to achieve given that we were far from home, being from Ireland! We wanted a memorable experience and we certainly got that! Shanti Home has soul and amazing food! We loved it! Can't recommend highly enough! "
shanti home ,"A great start We stayed in this hotel twice: at the very beginning &amp; at the very end of our tour of Rajasthan. Whilst the hotel is a little way outside of the city centre (but in return closer to the airport!), the friendly staff, clean &amp; interestingly decorated rooms and excellent roof top restaurant more than make up for it. We felt 'at home' from the first minute and would definitely recommend Shanti Home as a port for entering / exiting India, Delhi &amp; Rajasthan! "
shanti home ,"What makes this hotel great? The people! I was on a short business trip in Delhi recently. Instead of staying in one of the bigger chain hotels, I decided to stay here based on the positive reviews. I was happily surprised by the Shanti Home Hotel. Getting there from the airport was a tale in itself, but when I got to the hotel I was happy to find a modern, clean and comfortable hotel. The free internet access/computer is a big plus. The proximity to the subway was another plus point. But I would agree with some of the previous reviews concerning the neighborhood: it’s a bit grimy. But hey, you are in Asia. Big cities in Asia are supposed to be grimy!What makes this hotel great? The people! The inhouse trained staff at Shanti Home is absolutely amazing. It’s the small things they do that make a big difference to this hotel &quot;experience&quot;No wonder this is the #1 rated hotel in Delhi on tripadvisor! "
shanti home ,"Lovely hotel but be aware of its limitations! The Shanti Homes Hotel was our first port of call on our trip around the Golden Triangle and what a lovely place to kick off our travels.To prevent any disappointment, any person staying at this hotel must be aware of the following:1. There is no TV in your rooms. 2. There is no AC - then again we did travel in December when the mornings can be bitterly cold (5-6 DegC if Delhi is blanketed by fog). It does soon warm up to 23-25 DegC - perfect for touring Delhi. 3. Expect some noise - we were on level 3 which is directly below the restaurant and we could clearly hear the scraping of the chairs, voices and people walking. Once you can get these issues out of the way, then there is no doubt you will enjoy this hotel. The rooms are simple yet elegant and tastefully decorated (we stayed in Backwaters) and very clean. The service is excellent with staff extremely polite and welcoming. Some of the more grander hotels could learn a few tricks from this hotel. On entering the hotel, we were welcomed with sweet lime drinks and garlands. The restaurant area is located at the top of the hotel from where I was told you can get some great views but it was too foggy in the mornings to see anything. On our last day, the manager made up a small picnic for the children as we had a four hour drive to Agra. Its simple touches like this which made us feel like we were at home away from home.Day1: Arrival in DelhiAccomodation: Shanti Homes Hotel Shanti Home URL: www.shantihome.comBooked direct with Hotel – Taxi Pick-up from Airport which can be organised with Hotel (driver waiting at IG Airport as we arrived)Hotel Review can be found on www.tripadvisor.com Hotel close to Delhi Metro (10 minutes walk across busy road – careful if with small children) Day 2: DelhiCar booked with www.rajasthandriver.com directly.

The food was delicious eating up on the roof. They arranged a car for the next part of our travel and we went back at the end of our trip too as they were all so nice and my husband got a tailored suit there too! They really couldn't have done more for us - thank you all. "
shanti home ,Fantastic Rooms and Service The hotel reservations responded immediately when I sent an email asking for a reservation. They were very accommodating of my shifting schedule. They arranged train and flight transfers for me and went the extra mile. They also sent a staff person with me to the subway to show me how to use it the first time.Rooftop garden is very pleasant and an ideal place to enjoy a beer on a hot day.Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. It is a great place and I'll stay here again when I come to Delhi. 
shanti home ,"Great little hotel in Delhi Beautifully decorated boutique hotel with excellent roof-top restaurant (relatively inexpensive too). Small team of very attentive staff - overall ambiance very friendly.Two minor downsides: Not very central (40 minutes drive from Connaught Place or 30 minutes by metro), and our room was slightly noisy on the first night (being right next to reception).Overall, a great little hotel which feels much more personal than the typical Delhi international hotels. "
shanti home ,"nice place to stay I agree with the good points mentioned in other reviews. At first we wondered what we'd gotten into--it's basically a house in a residential area on the western side of Delhi, but the staff here makes all the difference. They are professional, warm, friendly and eager to please their guests. Anything can be arranged for sightseeing. This is a great place to stay for its proximity to the international airport. It can take 20 minutes to reach it with no traffic. The restaurant is excellent, which is good because there isn't anything else around, and after a day of sightseeing you won't want to venture out again at night. The chef trained in one of the top hotels in India. One thing that should be mentioned; be sure to ask the price of the chef's nightly seafood specials or you might be surprised. They were twice the price of anything on the menu. Our room was comfortable, but you do get noise from the hallways and above. The TV room has lots of Indian DVDs. "
shanti home ,"charming place! Very nice hotel recently open with high standards. The rooms are extremely clean, spacious and well furnished (the suite is gorgeous). They give us a warm and helpful reception. The location is somewhat far from downtown, but the near metro station offers a confortable and fast link. Higly recomended, it is definetely worth its price "
shanti home ,"Great Value!!! I needed to stay one night in Delhi since my international flight was arriving in the afternoon and I had a domestic flight scheduled for the next morning. I needed something cheap and, owing to the low price, I was not expecting that much from Shanti Home. Therefore, the hotel has been a pleasant surprise. I had also found a few negative tips from this hotel on the web (internet connection, airport shuttle...) but I they didn't harm in my case. Actually, I suspect that the hotel management is reading them and they are making all the best to improve. In fact, the pickup from the airport worked perfectly, despite my flight was 3 hours late. Also the wi-fi connection was more than decent, at least in my room. The room itself was nicely furnished, the breakfast excellent and the personnel very professional. In addition one can enjoy all the warmth and attentions of a family-managed accomodation, without all the impersonal of chain hotels. One is also very close to a station of the Delhi Metro, the only public transportation in town that can be safely used by a Western traveller. Of course, there were some minor issues: the neighborhood is not so attractive and may become pretty noisy (even for the standards of a city like Delhi); no TV in the room (I am not a TV watcher so I didn't pay too much attention to this detail) and there were people smoking in common areas (something more serious for me - a strong supporter of no-smoking policies!). Nevertheless, considering that the price was lower than 6,000 INR (~120 US$) per night all included, I can't imagine a better value for an accommodation in Delhi, where good hotels are not so frequent and it is not so uncommon to pay much more for much less. "
shanti home ,"Great food decor service impeccably clean Shanti Home is a great hotel. I had just finished a business trip, having stayed at two five star hotels in two other cities in India, and selected Shanti Home, based on the TripAdvisor reviews, to spend a few vacation days in New Delhi. First trip to India. Compared to the five star hotels I had been in, this is a welcome relief from the size and scale of the large hotels. You get five star service but it's more like a family inn rather than a huge hotel. OK, so there may not be a shelf full of glassware, a stocked refrigerator, TV, and other little useless doodads. Those things may be important for some types of hotel stays, but they really don't matter much to me. The hotel has most of them anyway for the asking, they're just not in each room. Don't get me wrong, the five star hotels are nice, especially for business travel, but at Shanti Home, it's a completely different, yet positive, experience. It's a four or five story building with just two to five rooms, more or less, on each floor. First of all, this is a brand new building- but, unlike &quot;big box&quot; new hotels, this has very carefully thought out architecture, furnishings, and decor which gives you the sense that you are in India---sort of like what a five star, colonial styled historical large inn would be in the U.S. --but with up to date bathrooms and infrastructure. The rooms are scupulously clean, very comfortable, with plenty of room. No &quot;cookie cutter&quot; type of furnishings--these look more like what you'd find in a B&amp;B bedroom rather than a typical hotel room. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They work as a team round the clock to ensure your questions are answered, and anything you need is handled. The owners made a point to meet every guest , on multiple occasions, at dinner on the rooftop restaurant. They put a lot of thought into designing this hotel to achieve a certain look. Regarding the rooftop restaurant, where most guests had breakfast and dinner, had great food, great atmosphere--sort of what I had experienced at La Meridian at another Indian city, but on a smaller scale. I especially enjoyed the fact I could have a standard &quot;eggs, toast, and coffee&quot; breakfast instead of traditional Indian fare. They definitely keep the Western tourist's interests in mind. The tandoori meals and other dinners were outstanding for dinner. The chef and wait staff are very attentive and service is comparable to any top restaurant in the U.S. I spent some time in the lounge using the desk to do some catch-up work on my laptop, which was easy with the wireless internet service. On another floor, there's a TV room with a large flat screen TV where a few people might gather to watch a movie or TV. I was also impressed by the security. There's a large, solid gated door with a guard 24/7 the propery perimeter. So, you get the sense as soon as you walk in that you're in good hands. The receptionist gives you a nice little map which helps the first time you venture out to walk to the train. The neighborhood is full of family residences and is just a few blocks from the train station. From there you can go anywhere in New Delhi with no trouble at all. Great location. I was very impressed with the train service--ultramodern, clean, easy to follow the stops etc. The most ironic thing about Shanti is the price. I was a little suspicious before I decided to come here under the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; axiom. But, based on the reviews, I took a chance and came here. No regrets-definitely the right choice. My conclusion--this is a steal at this price for the quality and delivery of room, restaurant, service, and location. Overall, if I were to return to New Delhi with my wife for another vacation, this is where I would definitely go, no question. "
shanti home ,"Great stay great value I stayed at Shanti Home twice during a recent trip to India while transiting through Delhi. On both visits I was extremely satisfied with all aspects of my stay and felt that I had received excellent value for money. The rooms are a good size and spotlessly clean - but it's the service were Shanti Home truely excels . On the first visit I arrived in the wee hours of the morning and enjoyed a super-quick and friendly check-in. As I slept in, the cook was only too happy to accomodate a very late breakfast, way beyond the normal breakfast hours and at no extra cost. As it was Christmas Day the owners hosted an evening Christmas Party for all guests on the lovely roof top terrace, and even got a charming elder gentleman to play the guitare and softly singing Xmas carols. Very thoughtful, and everybody also received a goodie bag gift with some Ayurveda body and face products! On my second visit I booked a three-day, two-night package that included a transfer, a day sightseeing in Delhi and a day trip to Agra. My train arrived 4 hours late and still the driver was there as agreed to meet me and I received complimentary early morning check-in that allowed me to freshen up before my day's sightseeing in Delhi and made a huge difference to the day. Leaving for Agra the next day made a very early start neccesary. I got a wake-up call at 4.00 am and a piping hot breakfast served at 4.45 am on the dot by a most friendly member of the staff - just as I had arranged the night before. I was amazed that they could serve a great breakfast at this unusual hour, and even more pleased that no extra charge was levied for the room service. Coming back late but hungry from Agra, the chef rustled up an amazing dinner after we discussed what I particulately liked - none of the items were on the menue and the meal was utterly delicious and was some of the best Indian food I had on my entire trip. I also had two massages at the in-house spa - both excellent and amazing value. When I mentioned to the owner how I had felt quite cold the first time round, they immediately put an electric fan heater into the massage room. It's this responsiveness to guests suggestions, the &quot;can-do&quot; attitude, and service centered around the guest that makes Shanti home so special. I shall be back! "
shanti home ,"Sligthly Disappointed Booked this hotel based on the favourable reviews on this site and I was a little bit disappointed.PositivesRoom is spacious with a comfortable bed.Sfaff is very friendly and helpful. They planned our day in delhi based on our wishes of what we wanted to see and went out of their way to always accomodate us.The restaurant is very good and the chef will accomodate your wishes.Negatives.The hotel is quite noisy. Most rooms on the first floor will face into the lobby area and the 3rd floor rooms get a lot of of noise from the rooftop restaurant. There is also quite a bit of noise from street traffic as well. The wireless internet connection is very good on the first floor. In our room on the 3rd floor the connection was useless. No charge for internet thoughThe shower was not good at all, for the price charged I would have expected more. "
shanti home ,"Clean and welcome refuge in Delhi We stayed here one night on our arrival in India and one night prior to departure. It is a clean, friendly respite from the bustle of Delhi. The rooms were nicely decorated with good bathrooms. The rooftop restaurant served great food.It is a little way out of the centre but we found the Subway easy to use (it was actually easier to get subway from old Delhi station than it was to get a auto rickshaw even with luggage), and they were happy to arrange taxis. I would recommend this as a nice base in New Delhi "
shanti home ,"loved the shanti home Stayed at this hotel for one night only but really enjoyed the experience. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, the room was clean and comfortable. The rooftop restaurant was awesome! great place for a drink and excellent meal prepared by their wonderful chef, Adil. "
shanti home ,"fabulous experiene I stayed at this property for the second time. This time I satyed for ten days The hotel is as clean, pristine and superb as it was during my previous stay. The icing on the cake this time was that the owners Sanjana and Rajat observerd that my birhtday was on oct 10 they just planned a surprise party for me on the rooftop restaurant (lantern) that included the staff (chef Adil) the poliet and courteos wait staff and the ever efficient and unforgetfull front office staff of ms. puja and mr. anand the staff had fresh flowers for me in the room with a sweet card. The kitchen made speacial food and they managed to bring out the cake. This time i used the hotel's staff to arrange the transport which I would suggest and stongly reccomend to all trvellers as the rates are very competitive and the drivers don't take you tounnecessary shopping stores where the locals try to sell crafts amd arts at exorbitant prices. So please go by the hotel's suggestion and take thier transport. The hotel is not trying to make money on the transport thier drivers are very courteos and well trained. the sitar lessons in the second floor lobby were very refreshing.Try the Ayurvedic Massgge. It is vigorating.They also hace a spa (A visting guest from england said for the money it was the best spa treatment she had!!!) "
shanti home ,"Shanti Home really does feel like a home My husband and I stayed at the Shanti Home both at the beginning of our trip (October, 2008) to India, Nepal and Bhutan and at the end (Dec. 2008). When we first arrived I felt overwhelmed by Delhi, but the staff at the hotel soon made me feel more comfortable.. There's a lovely rooftop restaurant which serves all meals (breakfast was included), and the chef is truly wonderful! There's a metro nearby which can take you into downtown Delhi and is great fun to travel on as you can people watch to your heart's content. The rooms are very comfortable--they're named for different areas of India--and very clean. There's also free internet access. But what makes the hotel truly wonderful are the people who work there--all of them were very concerned with our well-being and went out of their way to help us--even walking to the metro with us and showing us how to navigate the system. This concern for their guests extended from the charming owners, Sanjana and Rajat Verma, to include all we encountered. When we returned to Delhi at the end of our trip, it really did feel as if we had come home! "
shanti home ,"I don't get it After following inconsistent and confusing directions provided by the hotel, the airport pre-paid taxi driver and I were eventually able to find the hotel (a word of advice, print out a map and hand it to your driver, no one will ever be able to find this unless they are very familiar with the neighborhood).The very polite reception clerk put me, a lone 6'3'' gentleman into a room with two double beds. I wasn't thrilled about it, but my assistant who booked the room had informed me that was all that was available and so I was expecting. All I really wanted was to write some emails, maybe watch the news, and get to sleep early thereby completing my scrooge Christmas routine. And here begins my particular issues with this hotel. Firstly, a very minor quibble, no televisions in any of the rooms; thereby scuttling my plans to watch the news. No problem I thought, I'll switch to plan b and go straight to dealing with the various chores I needed the internet's magical assistance to complete. Bad new on this front too, the internet connection in my room was so slow as to be ineffectual. Not great, but no problem, plan C, straight to bed in a crisp pair of pajamas. As you may have guessed, here is where the third problem arises. The rooms close to the reception hall / main entrance area are so inundated with noise of all types that it renders sleep practically impossible for all but the most drunken of would be sheep-counters. The phone ringing in the lobby, guests chattering as they come and go, various hotel workers gossiping etc. As this had all occurred in less than 20 minutes, I decided that this hotel was clearly not the place for me. I informed the gentleman at the counter that I would be changing hotels because for the approximately $130 (6000r) that I was paying for the room, it seemed only fair that I be able to sleep. The clerk quickly sprang into action and said he would change my room to one on the second floor immediately. Fine I thought, and as he didn't offer me the choice of refunding my money, it seemed the best choice on offer. The second floor features a much nicer room, with one large bed (why they didn't offer it to me if it was free when I asked for a room with a larger bed earlier is a mystery). I took off my shoes an settled in whereupon the windows started shaking with what can only be described as the bizarre sound of an Indian gentleman playing the sort of hits of the 60's / 70's that I strive to avoid in every day life (Think 'Lela' and that song with the refrain 'driving down the road trying to loosen my load' -I'm not sure what that one is called).Giving up on sleep I decided to go upstairs to the restaurant to check out the food selection. It looked fine, but extremely pricey, even in terms of hotel food. I would have eaten, but the music (obviously louder considering its proximity) got to me and I had to run for it. After grabbing some food at a shop down the street, I came back, with the music still blaring, I decided on a quick shower, I turn the faucet on, check the tap, its hot, i get in. After getting in the water gets icy cold in about 30 seconds, leaving me with a significant amount of my person covered in suds. It seems that the staff neglected to tell me about the switch that turns the hot water heater on, and which I did not consider as a possibility as it is a phenomena generally limited to lower end hotels. It is now 11pm, and the acoustic singer has given up, but has been replaced with recordings of slow jams. Sleep seems very far away indeed. "
shanti home ,"Wonderful Place! Words cannot express how wonderful our stay at Shanti Home was! The hotel is immaculately clean, the beds are very comfortable and everything is welcoming. But the real accomplishment of this place is the people. The staff are so kind and considerate - you really feel that they are happy to have you. The restaurant is superb. We ate every dinner there, happily. The hotel is away from downtown and is quiet (but Delhi standards) and there was nothing better than coming back to Shanti, having a fantastic meal and then going downstairs to sleep in their very comfy beds. Adil, the chef, was extremely accommodating of my father's special diet and also very kind and friendly. The entire staff was very genuine and kind, but not enough good things can be said of Pooja. She is really a gem! Her heart opens to you and she really looks out for you to ensure you have a fantastic stay. She helped plan itineraries, gave advice and booked travel for us. Honestly, I cannot compliment her enough!! She really warmed our hearts. We also met the owners, Rajat and Sanjana, whom I had communicated with via email prior to arrival, and they are really great people. Very warm and inviting and you can see the pride and effort that they have put into this establishment. I really enjoyed our conversations at dinner.Shanti Home is highly, highly recommended!! I would go back in a heart beat!! "
shanti home ,"Clean and comfotable but can be noisy Shanti Home was reasonably priced, comfortable and also convenient for the metro. It has a very pleasant rooftop restaurant overseen by Adil who prepares excellent food.Staff are courteous, helpful and efficient. The hotel is very clean and has a comfortable lounge, TV room, internet station and massage facility. Our only complaint was that the hotel suffers badly from traffic noise from the nearby six lane highway. We suspect that this depends on which room you are allocated and whether it faces onto the road. On the positive side staff dealt quickly and sympathetically with our request for a move to a quieter room.Overall we enjoyed our stay but advise light sleepers that they may have problems. "
shanti home ,"fantastic restaurant on the rooftop We had been staying in some of the best hotels in Mombai, Agra , Udaipur, Veranasi etc., and decided to try Shanti Home in Delhi for a change from the large hotels. We were not disappointed. Our room was called &quot;Bollywood&quot; and was very nice and clean, but the restaurant on the roof was fantastic. Sanjana and Rajat (the owners) couldn't do enough for us.The chef is a genius! We had the best food at Shanti Home, after 2 weeks travelling and staying at the best hotels. We will be back! "
shanti home ,"Best hotel in Delhi!!!! I spent 5 weeks in total traveling throughout different parts of India and this by far was the best hotel I had stayed at. I was so impressed by this hotel I forfeited an already pre paid two night stay at a Karol Bagh hotel at the other end of town so I could end my India adventure with Shanti Home. I had never been to India before, I was a single female traveling alone from Canada, and after 30 hours of traveling from my hometown I wanted to check into a clean quiet hotel that was safe, with great staff, for a great price, and Shanti Home did not disappoint, it exceeded my expectations! The staff is what makes this hotel the best hotel I have ever stayed at in my entire life! Without the staff this hotel would just be like any other hotel. They make you feel like you are part of the family. I had read that previously in other reviews and I didn’t really believe it until I experience it. They are extremely friendly, courteous, always smiling and truly have the willingness to please you from their hearts expecting nothing in return. Whatever you need just ask. If it is possible, they will make it happen. They were always well presented with clean uniforms, clean shaven and well kept hairstyles. Pooja the front desk manager was an absolute angel!!! Shanti Home could not employ a better front desk manager. She gives right from the heart, is very knowledgeable about Delhi, perfect English, very professional, and truly wants you to have the best stay possible. She helped me plan a day in Delhi by giving me suggestions on what to see and do and gave me a detailed map of downtown. She was always happy to arrange hotel taxi’s for me, direct me to great local shopping or guide me to the local metro station which is just a short walk from the hotel. She is the BEST!!!The chef of the Lantern restaurant will tantalize your tastebuds with his creations. He is also eager to please, has a great way of whipping up dishes for you when you are hungry whether it be lunch, dinner, or very late at night. MMMMMM good, that is what I say about Adil.Working closely with Adil is Anand, the food and beverage manager. Anand is very friendly, happy to inform you about what wine is in stock, very knowledgeable, efficient, and always smiling. He makes your dinning experience and outstanding one!Rajesh and Ram were fine young gentlemen that were always there to bring you anything you needed. If you can persuade him, Rajesh has an amazing singing voice. Ram was always there in the mornings to serve breakfast with a smile. I loved chatting with both or them, very nice gents!Suresh and Tul were also committed to making your stay as pleasant as possible. Tul was always so accommodating, always with a beautiful smile and gentle manner.If you needed anything after hours or very early in the morning, Dinesh was the man you needed to talk to. He is happy to fulfill your needs if you wake up in the middle of the night and needed something. He was always just a phone call away. I booked my reservation directly through the hotel by e-mail. My e-mail questions were always answered within 24 hours by the owner Rajat. Another reason I booked with Shanti Home was it was one of the only hotels I found online that didn’t require a credit card payment either a deposit or full payment when you made your reservation. I recommend to have them arrange an airport pick up. I have to say that it is a bit more than you would pay for a taxi from the airport but it is such a nice feeling to know that someone would be waiting for you at the arrival hall after such a long flight. Sanjay was waiting for me exactly where they said he would be with a very clear sign identifying the hotel and my name in full in large print. He was in contact with the hotel letting them know that I had arrived and we were on our way to the hotel. Also when you use their taxi service the drivers never have a problem finding the hotel. Every time I took a tuk tuk or taxi on my own the driver always had a bit of a problem finding the hotel. When you do venture out on your own ask the lovely Pooja to send you out with a small location map of the hotel so you can give it to the taxi or tuk tuk driver so they don’t get lost when bringing you back.From the moment i pulled into the driveway at Shanti Home the service was unbelievable. Five star hotels I have stayed at did not have the level staff and service that Shanti Home did. Staff took my bags, led me to the front desk and did so all with a smile. When I tried to tip them they politely refused my tip. I later found out that there is no tipping directly to the staff. There are clay ducks around the hotel that at anytime during your stay you may tip into them. Each month they break open the ducks and the tips are split among the staff. It was very nice because as I later found out staff are like sharks for your tip throughout India.I was greeted by the wonderfully warm, friendly, and beautiful Pooja at the front desk with a glass of fresh juice and a flower lei. Check in was wonderful, she took care of everything. My baggage was already in my room by the time I had completed check in. When I went into my room the A/C was already on for me and the room cool, which was so nice because it was HOT in Delhi.The rooms were beautifully decorated in very pleasing colours with an eye for detail, style, and design. The beds were super comfy, the sheets always very clean and white, great pillows, and an inviting duvet. The cleanliness of the room was immaculate!!! Each room came with a safe.There was 24 hour free wifi that was accessible anywhere in the hotel. It was not working one day when I was there and when I brought it to their attention they had their tech guy there within the hour fixing the problem. Shanti Home has a great media room fully stocked with movies both Bollywood and Hollywood. There are a number of English channels on the huge flat screen tv along with a few English movie channels like HBO.I never had a bad meal at the rooftop restaurant Lantern and the prices were reasonable. The staff there were as friendly here as anywhere in the hotel. Breakfast had many choices from freshly made omelets to tea and toast. I always had the fruit plate which was always fresh and wonderful. The marvelous chef Adil truly works his culinary magic and skill in the kitchen and was happy to accommodate any personal changes you would like to make to the dishes on the menu. He always came out and greeted you with his dazzling beautiful smile and soft spoken manner to make sure that once you had started your meal that everything was to your liking. It always was. Try the ross gollah with a scoop of ice cream, it was outstanding! Anything from the tandoori will knock your socks off! I didn’t have better tandoori anywhere else in my time in India as good as the Lantern tandoori. The tandoori doesn’t open until 7pm so plan accordingly. Also, if you wish to have your meal anywhere else in the hotel as opposed to the rooftop just let them know and they will be happy to bring it to you at anytime of the day or night. There is no other choice of hotels for me when I return to Delhi. It will be Shanti Home. Do not hesitate to book this hotel for your stay, you will not be disappointed. "
shanti home ,"Shanti really is exceptional I have just returned from two nights in Delhi where I stayed at Shanti home. From the airport pick up service to my very early morning departure nothing was too much trouble. The staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful. The place is charming and spotless, with modern amenities. The small outside restaurant and bar on the top floor looks out over the city. There was a problem with the wireless on my floor, which they fixed, although it was in the early hours of the morning. They even printed a 20 page conference paper free of charge. "
shanti home ,"A great introduction to Indian hospitality As this was our first trip to India, and given the very positive reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to stay overnight at Shanti Home in New Delhi. We were not disappointed. Arrangements were easily made with the owner, Rajat, over the internet. We were met at the airport and driven to the property where we received a traditional Indian welcome. Our room was clean and very comfortable. However, the highlight of our stay was the food prepared by the hotel’s executive chef, Adil, at the property’s restaurant. Overseen by the restaurant manager, Anand, both the service and food were outstanding. Given that our train departed late in the evening the next day, the hotel let us use their spa facilities to freshen up at no extra cost. Prior to departing we had another excellent dinner at the restaurant. Highly recommended. "
shanti home ,"Perfect place to stay in Delhi The Shanti home is a fantastic place to stay in Delhi - I can't recommend it highly enough. I only stayed for a very brief one night while in transit through Delhi, but from start to finish everything was perfect. Firstly our flight was delayed, then I was further delayed by a lost bag, turning up 2 hours late at the airport to find my driver still there!The hotel is located around 20 minutes drive from the airport, and is situated in a secluded area of town, around 25 minutes away from the centre by tube, but the tube is very safe and 100% better than the London underground! The lady on the reception recommended a restaurant called Punjabi by nature (http://www.punjabibynature.in/) and it was fantastic - probably the best Indian food I have ever tasted (and I'm originally from Bradford). She could have pushed her own restaurant but didn't, even though it looked lovely as well. I had to check out at 3.00am, and I got delivered breakfast and got a wakeup call which I was very impressed with. There is free internet and lots of books to read, as well as chess boards. There is a massage available for 2 hours for around £15 which looked excellent value - unfortunately I didn't have time. Fantastic hotel, deserves all the good reviews it has got. "
shanti home ,"An Oasis of Calm A warm welcome awaits you at this charming hotel. It is like reaching an oasis of calm as soon as you walk through the door. Our group of 6 stayed here at the beginning and end of our holiday which began with a pep talk from Rajat (the hotel owner) on how to stay well in India. His tips: 1) Bottled water only (check the seal). 2) No cut fruit or salad, as it will have been washed in unbottled water. 3) No roadside food no matter how tempting it looks! 2) is a bit tricky to stick to at all times - we assumed the cut fruit at the Shanti Home breakfast was OK to eat and were fine.The hotel location is a residential area which is quite far out so it's worth being picked up by the hotel taxi whose driver knows where it is. Rooms are very comfortable with the best ones being at the back away from the noise of the busy road nearby. It's a short walk away from the metro which is cheap and easy to use. It costs 15 INR and takes about 25 mins to get into the city centre. Internet access is free and the lift takes you to the floor below the roof top restaurant with steps up the remainder, but for an older person these are not steep.At the Shanti Home we found every member of staff to be friendly especially the lady on reception who helped us with info on a number of things. Nothing seemed too much trouble, not even laying on breakfast at 5am so that we could eat before catching an early train. On our last evening we'd had enough of hot and spicy food after 2 weeks of travelling and so the chef and his team (see photo) at his suggestion prepared us an entire 4 course meal with just the curry spices but no chilli. It was delicious. The restaurant staff were also extremely good sports and acted as judges of which of us had best mastered the Indian head waggle that means 'Yes' as opposed to the other type of waggle that means 'No'! "
shanti home ,"Truely at Peace at Shanti Home I was lucky enough to spend my first few days in India at the Shanti Home. The rooms were immaculate, the staff was courteous, and the food was excellent. This is definitely the best place I had stayed in during my journey through India and would definitely recommend this place to any/everyone traveling through New Delhi. "
shanti home ,"Simply the Best This was the best place that we stayed in during our two week trip to India.The service is great, the whole place is spotless and has been designed with a lot of attention to detail.At the end of the stay they even helped us to find some other good accomodation.I would recommed staying here even if you do have to pay a little bit more, it is worth it. The food is also very nice and is on par with a 5* hotel.The only bad point was that they forgot to call us for a wakeup call on both nights and the air conditioning unit could be heard from the bedroom. Compared to other places it was very quiet though (I am a very light sleeper). "
shanti home ,"They want your money and dont eat the lunch Overall a score of 7/10. Good quiet location, well decorated and clean rooms but there are a number of BIG negatives. We were under the impression that this was one of the best in delhi but it failed to live up to expectations.Disappointed that no free pick up from local train station - a charge of 350 rp and then 500 rp to be dropped off at airport. After 2 weeks in india and rajasthan/delhi, this is the only hotel that has charged us for pick up.We made the mistake of eating at the lantern rooftop restaurant at lunch - food was bland to say the least. The worst meal we had had in india and for 900 rps we expected much more. When we asked for more spice (or anything to give it some flavour) we got a bottle of tabasco - not a good sign. The chef redeemed himself at dinner when the tandoori is open. Our tip is to skip lunch and eat there only in the evening, eating off the tandoori. Also if you like a vague element of spice mention it as otherwise you will get a curry with no spice at all (which they seem to think is the british curry....)Overall - the staff seem to just want visitors money. Ps don't get massage - my one hour was up after only 30 mins and then it cost 1000 rps ( the supposed charge for the pamper package which should have been for 1 hour massage, 1 hour sauna and green tea / apple).

shanti home ,"Take me back to Shanti Home! Shanti Home is by far the best place to stay! We booked our stay through the tripadvisor website from reading the reviews and checking out the photos it seemed like the one to go with for our first nights in Dehli. And we were right!Shanti exceeded our expectations ten fold! As sisters travelling in India for the first time, we were a little hesistant about touching down in Dehli in the dark of night. But we need not have worried. As we had arranged, a driver from Shanti greeted us at the airport....holding a sign bearing my name. Such a comforting sight in a strange city! Stepping into the hotel is absolute bliss, the whole place including the rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. A guard sits on duty at the front gate full time as far as we saw. So there's no worries security wise. We were able to step out into the warm Indian air from our own balcony which looked out onto the street....which is pretty quiet on comparison with most around the area. The train is only a few blocks away....which makes travel to the heart of New Delhi so easy. I strongly advise to know where you are going to save any hassles and arrive back to the hotel during daylight hours (things look very different at night....needless to say we got slightly lost but arrived home safely). There is 24 hour access to internet facilities free of charge which is fantastic for the weary traveller wanting to spread their news of their adventures to family and friends. The food here is devine, fresh and totally yummy! The staff and chefs in the restaurant are friendly and it won't be long until you feel right at home. From the hotel you are able to organise a driver for the day and staff are more than happy to arrange some sight seeing for an extra cost. If you want to visit the markets, temples, gardens, restaurants, or go shopping, its up to you. They take you there, drop you off and wait for you, ready to take you to the next place. A good way to ease yourself into the hustle and bustle of the Indian way of life.A big big thanks to Pooja, who went out of her way to make our stay in India so memorable :) We will be back! "
shanti home ,Highly recommended Great hotel with a very efficient and helpful owner. The rooms are individually decorated and very stylish - so much more charm than a big soulless international conference hotel. The owner went out of his way to he helpful including coming to find us in the city in his own car when our Jaipur driver couldn't find the address. A super place to stay. 
shanti home ,"A beautiful place to stay very nice decorated. Shanti Home is a very cosy, warm and good place to stay, in a very busy and noisy area. It has great rooms, different in sizes, but clean and with perfect beds, nice equipment, decorated with personal things and a really indian atmospheric !It is quiet, in the house, in the rooms, in spite of the busy road near to the hotel, with a lot of traffic. But when you are in the hotel, you really feel peacefull and relaxt !There is a fantastic, beautiful restaurant / terras on the top, where they serve very good meals, a lot of choice. The staff is great, personal, very polite and they like to talk with you, to help you in every way and to give you the perfect service you need. Especially the owners are great people! They come to you, when you enjoy your meal or a nice cup of coffee and ask you how you feel and if everything is fine. I really appreciated this personal attention an attitude !! You feel at home and want to come back over and over, to this place. So we hopefully will !! "
shanti home ,"Incredible Shanti Home I liked staying at Shanti Home:CleanVery friendly and helpful persons (they help you with your trip planning and also organize a driver for you)Nice rooms with a creative designWith restaurant on top of the roofOnly negative: It's closed to the metro, but as the metro has a limited rail network, it takes nearly an hour until you are at the place you want to visit within the centre "
shanti home ,"Standards Maintained My wife and I stayed at this lovely boutique hotel for the second time this year.I am pleased to confirm that the very high and exacting standards of the hotel have been maintained in every respect right through from email confirmations, to airport pick up, arrival, stay, restaurant and departure.The hotel is clean well laid out and all the staff are most helpful and welcoming. I sum up our second visit as 'going back to see the family'We shall continue to use this hotel as our base in Delhi as I have a motto of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'.Well done Rajat, you have created a hotel that matches the very best standards of equivalent hotels elsewhere in the world.Surinder &amp; Rashpal Buray "
shanti home ,"Everything it claims to be and more Staying at this hotel is a wonderful experience.Check the hotel website it’s fact. There are no overstated claims and it truly represents what the hotel is all about.From our first telephone call, dealt with by the wonderfully efficient and friendly Pooja, to emails answered promptly by owner Rajat Verma, the pre-arrival vibes were excellent and we weren’t disappointed.The quality of accommodation is excellent, with very well appointed rooms and great taste shown in the decoration. We stayed at the Shanti twice and had ‘Oh Calcutta’ the second time – fantastic. It’s worth asking for. Other contributors have mentioned that it’s below the roof terrace; you would have to be particularly sensitive to let this worry you. Moving up to the restaurant on the roof, this is a fabulous escape from the hurley burley of chaotic Delhi, great food and a place to relax with a cold beer.Chef Addie (formerly of the Oberoi in Agra) has cooked for presidents and you can tell. Don’t worry about the menu, chat with Addie and Rajat, about what you like and leave the rest to the chef, I doubt you will be disappointed.On the face of it, the location may appear questionable, but proximity to the airport and with the metro on the doorstep, it works exceptionally well. External staff are brought in to look after the spa treatments. We enjoyed a massage and a fascial, both were excellent and great value. The steam room is a nice extra and rounds treatment sessions off well.In thirty years of extensive travelling, I have not found a hotel to compare with this, for the atmosphere and a genuine desire to delight customers. Sure, you can pay thousands of bucks a night for real opulence, but I don’t believe that your experience will be any better.In conclusion; nothing is too much trouble for Rajat and his team, we look forward to staying with him again. "
shanti home ,"Excellent pick up from the airport I was landing at Delhi airport at 23.30, and wanted the re-assurance of a reliable pick up. I had reviewed this hotel on Trip advisor and was very impressed with the comments. I therefore booked direct with the hotel for myself and 2 friends to stay the one night.Went completely without a hitch. Good online communication directly with the hotel, and very accommodating when I wanted to change my reservation.We stayed in one of the Luxury rooms, (this slept 3), it was immaculately clean and the bed linen was crispy white (I love how they starch their whites!!!).We used the rooftop restaurant for a quick drink after arrival, ice cold kingfisher and freezer chilled glasses were most welcome.The hosts also organised a taxi for our onward journey, which, after some negotiation we were very happy with!Would definately recommend for weary travellers. "
shanti home ,"A true jewel in India's crown I was part of a large trip that traveled throughout Rajasthan for a week. When we arrived in Delhi, we splintered off into groups. Many of my fellow travelers had booked rooms in more familiar names like the Hilton or the Hyatt. I had read reviews of the Shanti Home on Tripadvisor and it sounded like most guests were very happy with their experience, so I decided to try it. I couldn't be more happy with my decision. While not centrally located, Shanti is very close to the Metro which can take you anywhere in the city in a matter of moments. It is also only a short cab ride (&quot;short&quot; being a relative term in Delhi's traffic) from downtown. But aside from it's less-than-ideal location, Shanti is a wonderful hotel. The staff is attentive and offers you the type of personal service that you cannot get in a larger chain hotel. The rooms are beautiful, each decorated with a different regional theme, complete with hand-carved furniture. Little things like free wi-fi in the rooms make you feel like you aren't being nickel-and-dimed.The restaurant on the rooftop is not only visually sumptuous, though a little on the warm side, but the fare offered is varied and delicious. Bottom line is that Shanti Home was a wonderful place to spend the final few nights of an amazing trip. "
shanti home ,"Great Place! I have stayed here twice on business. Great food, free internet connections, but best of all are the husband and wife who own the hotel. They are great hosts and their advice on India was always spot on. Especially for a Westerner this is invaluable.John T. "
shanti home ,"Lovely homely boutique hotel. I stayed at this lovely boutique hotel in May 2008.It was a wonderful experience from the moment of arrival,which was late at night. It was off-peak season for travellers and the hotel was partially occupied. We were met by owners Rajat and Sanjana who were entertaining friends on the rooftop terrace.They invited us to join them and their friends for some food and drink.They were so hospitable and we really enjoyed ourselves that evening. Each room is themed and tastefully decorated eg. 'Bollywood Talkies'. Each and every member of staff were really friendly and always ready for conversation.The 'Lantern Rooftop Terrace' is lovely for breakfast and a drink in the evening. Ranakpuri, where the hotel is located is a suburb on the Metro line, which is only five minutes walk away and takes twenty minutes to the city centre. In the lounge is a laptop,the use of which is complimentary for checking emails and making online bookings. Staying at this hotel was a truly wonderful and fantastic experience. I would mention Chef Adil, Ms Pooja, Mr. Dinesh Saroha and Mr. Tuol from Nepal but I include all staff who helped to make our stay so homely. Continued sucess and best wishes to all at Shanti Home. It is deservedly No. 1 on Tripadvisor. Ciaran, Claire and Colette. "
shanti home ,Full of Shanti!! A Fantastic start to our honeymoon - and a haven as described in other online reviews...Also staying in a boutique hotel was high on novelty.Loved the rooftop restaurant with its chilled beer glasses and free internet. Tandoori food in the evening was an added bonus. A breakfast buffet would have been a welcome addition but the service compensated - staff moved fans to wherever we sat!Restaurant prices were reasonable compared to the UK.Thanks also to the owner Rajat who was very hospitable and welcoming and the staff who stayed up for our arrival / departure.Facilities were good - a separate TV room actually was a good thing to inhibit couch potato tendencies and the best value for money massage service we had out of all the places we stayed. Generally friendly personal service and have no hesitation to recommend this for anyone who wants good value for money with a touch of class... and 'Full of Peace' compared to the rest of Delhi. 
shanti home ,"Can't quite pull it off. I booked this hotel for a weekend break in Delhi as a birthday treat for my wife. The website gives the impression of a stylish boutique hotel, which it tries hard to be - but doesn't quite manage to achieve.For one, the hotel is a lot smaller (almost cramped) than the website gives the impression of - it's a converted family apartment block. None of the rooms are huge.It is nicely decorated, throughout, however, some rooms are better appointed than others. We saw a number of rooms, as none of the rooms we were given had a bath with a working plug / hot water / broken spa function.The restaurant on the roof is ok, but nothing special. However, therre's no-where else in the area to eat. To be frank, there's better, more central hotels in Delhi which cost less than this place - and then you've more eating and drinking options. For the price that this place charges, you'd expect perfection. Maybe we were just unlucky in our experience, but we found ourselves begrudging paying, and left early. "
shanti home ,"loved shanti hi we stayed in shanti for 3 days in august .it was absolutely beautiful and best value hotel I have ever stayed in .the rooms are excellent and themed .strongly recommend the massage and the spa .also had a yoga lesson arranged which was fantastic.the food in the rooftop restaurent is fantastic .chef adil cooks both Indian and continental food and was happy to cook exmenu for my two teenagers .finger licking stuff .good ambience .very friendly staff and feels like home.gave us a comlimentary mobile phone which saved me a lot of money on roaming.great breakfast included in price .very handy to delhi metro and 20 mts to city centre .preferred this as tucked away in a quiet residential place .very safe and quiet neighbourhood.have a lovely quiet lounge and a separate tv lounge with few good dvds .kept the teenagers happy .overaall felt at home throughout our stay right from airport pickup ,traditional welcome and check in .the wifi and complimetary laptop also v useful .the owners rajat and sanjana have put their heart and soul in this and are there to put in a personal touch .will surely be staying there again .

shanti home ,"Like a paradise in Delhi! It was a perfect choise for our first time in India! The quality and the service here are excellent. This oasis of calm appears from the beginning by the pleasant smell of the incense, by the elegant furnishing and overall by the smile of the persons. The kindness of all staff in Shanti Home is unforgettable. We met Pooja at the reception: she gave us all information we needed, she bought for us the railway tickets to Varanasi and Agra, she has lent her mobile the day after our arrival. Unfortunately we had waited one day for my husband's luggage, her mobile was an invaluable help to receive the news from the Airport, she called us as soon as she has received the good news about the bag recovery.The chef and the resaurant staff have been always so kind, food and service was accurate too.We also stayed in this beautiful place the last night before our return in Italy, is was the best way to say good by to India! Our rooms were very confortable, clean and quit airconditioned (it is a real rarity in India).We strongly recommend this piece of paradise in the caothic and enchanting Delhi!With love Tiziana and GiuseppeMilan - Italy "
shanti home ,"Beautiful hotel great service Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our 4 week holiday around India and Nepal, so didn't mind that it seemed so far out of the centre of Delhi, since we had stayed there earlier in the month. Picked up from the airport for 650rs and greeted at the hotel with juice and flower necklace. No hassle checking in, as they just took a copy of our passports, then took us up to our room where are bags were already waiting. The room was clean, white, modern and had great air conditioning. Double doors went out onto a small balcony, and the bathroom was small but very clean with soft, white towels and lots of hot water. There was a TV room on our floor, with a huge plasma TV and sky, plus plenty of chairs and settees. But no TV in the room. The next floor down had a large area for sitting and working at a table, and a laptop set up for using the internet for free. The whole hotel is furnished with beautiful Indian crafts and pictures, carved wooden furniture, well decorated and looked after. The staff are very friendly and eager to help. There is a tip box to use so tips are shared out among them all. On the rooftop was an (expensive) restaurant serving a range of Indian and International dishes, snacks, drinks (including beer for 100rs). In the evenings they have a tandoori oven cooking some great food, including good meat and fish. Room service was great, with food and drinks brought quickly throughout the day and night. However we would have liked a bit more for our money when ordering toast and tea in the morning!Although the hotel seemed far out from the centre of Delhi, the metro stop is 5 minutes walk away, with a 14rs ticket that took you into downtown in 25 minutes. It was so easy and quick, clean and cool, which was great instead of taking rickshaws around the busy streets, and so much cheaper. The hotel is more expensive than any other hotel we used on our holiday (6000rs), but we wanted to have some luxury in the last couple of days before returning home. So it was worth the money, and so nice to come back to after a day out in Delhi. A car took us back to the airport for 500rs, although we had to make a 30 minute detour to an ATM as their card reader wasn't working when we wanted to pay the bill. But we did manage to still get to the airport on time, as their driver definitely knows the backstreets and isn't afraid to go fast to get there in 30 minutes!!We really enjoyed staying here, and felt it ended our holiday perfectly. "
shanti home ,"The Best Excellent host &quot;pooja&quot;, great food, helpful and friendly owners on site, rooms very clean and comfortable, the employees are very courteous and polite. I was traveling with a group of ten and after we stayed in Bangalore, and Mysore for three weeks in India, we all still agreed on one thing, and that was that Shanti Home was the absolute best hotel experience we had in this country. We all will suggest that our teacher make this a permanent stop each year on Kennesaw State University's Study Abroad in India Program. Shanti Home is absolutely the best. "
shanti home ,"Om shanti ohome Stayed at the Shanti home for my birthday. As my first trip to India (alone) ,the wonderful hosts (mr and mrs rajat) treated me like i had been staying there for years. Late flight from NY brought me to the hotel at almost midnight that night, with Mr. Rajat there to hand me a refreshing lime juice drink. The spacious rooms are beautifully decorated in themes (I stayed in Bombay Talkies.. made me want to sing in a Bollywood movie), the restaurant delicious, and staff treat you like royalty. The location was a bit from the city center (20 min).. however, the train station was a short walk from the hotel (one of the staff members even walked me over). The trains themselves were very clean, modern, and fast. To be honest, after a day in the busy center, to come back to Shanti Home was something to look forward to. I want to thank Mr. and Mrs Rajat for the surprise birthday cake at dinner. It was such a mouth watering cake, and warmed by heart the rest of my trip in India. "
shanti home ,"A True Oasis--and Wonderful Service! We stayed at the Shanti Home in Delhi, India after a three week volunteer stint teaching English in the remote Indian Jungle. We decided to treat ourselves to a little luxury before we flew home.The hotel ALWAYS emailed us back promptly and provided clear, concise answers to our questions. Their English is very good.We were picked up by the taxi driver, provided by the hotel, at Nizmuddin train station...and were very glad for this service. Train stations in Delhi can be a bit daunting!Arriving at the hotel at 8am we were NOT charged for obtaining the room prior to the posted check-in time.The room was clean, beautiful and exactly as advertised. There WAS a problem with the hot water however, but since it was so hot in India at the time of our stay--it was not an issue.Pooja, the manager was extrememly helpful...giving us clear directions and answers to all our questions about transport etc.The hotel even provides a complimentary mobile phone, that you simply have to buy a card for with the appropriate amount of minutes. The card was purchased by her staff, and the rupee amount we chose, was simply added to our room bill. This way, we called home often, which was VERY convenient. Wireless services in India are great! STD's --not so much..as they are often noisy places and making a call is difficult.Each day we returned to the hotel was a welcome relief after the chaos of Delhi. The hotel is clean and inviting.There is a lounge with a large TV that is available there are NO TV's in the room. There IS a lap top for internet connection...but only one, so in the busy season getting time on the computer MAY be an issue..for us, it was always available --this may be due to the fact that guests SEEMED to be minimal, although I am not sure.The day of our departure, we stored our luggage and arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport at 7pm. We returned to the hotel around 5pm, and Pooja was more than welcoming. She encouraged us to use the facilities--washrooms/internet/TV lounge until our taxi arrived.The hotel IS removed from &quot;downtown&quot; Delhi, but downtown is easily accessible by Metro...you are downtown within an hour, at a cost of 15 rupees.Returning to the hotel was always nice...the restaurant was very nice, and the food was good. I would suggest to the management that a breakfast buffet would be a better choice for tourists, as opposed to ordering off the non-existent menu, however...but thats just me perhaps.The restaurant is not expensive by Western Standards, but is by Indian standards. It was worth it though.I cant express how welcoming and helpful the staff is. I would not hesitate to stay at Shanti Home again. In India, you get what you pay for.L "
shanti home ,"Amazing hotel that treats you like famliy First, I have to apologize for taking so long to write this review. We were looking back at pictures of our most recent trip to India the other day, and had to rave about Shanti Home. I truly cannot say enough about our experience here.My trip to Delhi did not start off on a good note ... I originally booked another hotel for my fiance and I in Delhi, which turned out to be absolutely horrendous. After coming across the reviews for Shanti Home on Trip Advisor, I placed a desperate call at 4am and the owners of Shanti Home rescued us from the other hotel. The owners and staff of Shanti Home truly treated us like family during our stay. If you are looking at hotels in Delhi, or in India overall for that matter, you may notice that finding a good price for a quality hotel is hard to come by. We stayed at several 4 star+ properties during our trip to India, and the overall experience that this property offers was on par if not better than the other hotels we visited (and paid A LOT more for). Some key features of this hotel ... The rooms are very clean and tastefully decorated (I wanted to bring some of the furniture back with me). Free wi-fi was pretty fast and worked during our entire 3 night stay. The restaurant at Shanti Home is a fantastically relaxing experience, and unexpected in the hustle and bustle of Delhi. Also, the metro is very close, clean, and efficient - more on the metro system at Shanti Home's website under &quot;Location&quot; - it really was only about 20 minutes to Connaught Place. I would recommend Shanti Home to anyone. Thanks again to the owners for taking care of us! "
shanti home ,"Best Hotel in all of India Shanti Home is an immaculately presented boutique hotel situated in New Delhi. The furnishings and decor are themed for each room, such as 'Oh Calcutta!' and 'Bombay Talkies' providing the guest with a unique view of India. The Hotel owners, Sanjana and Rajat are a delight and provide you with top notch customer service during your stay, as do the hotel staff. Best features to look out for: the roof top terrace, the day spa and the library/entertainment rooms. This is the best destination for your first landing into India and to be pampered as you exit India. You will not be disappointed! "
shanti home ,"Exceeded our highest expectations!! My wife @ I stayed @ Beautiful Shanti Home for 4 nights. It was an incredibly welcoming introduction to India and the most enjoyable part of our visit to Delhi. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was very clean and had a very large room &amp; bathroom. But what stood out was the treatment and service we received from the owners(Sanjana &amp; Rajat) and staff (Dinesh, Ram, Pooja, Anand, &amp; others). On our first day in Delhi, we dropped and lost our cell phone. After telling the hotel staff about it, Sanjana &amp; Rajat arranged to obtain a replacement phone within hours, along with a SIM card so we could make international calls. Other great services were personally walking us to the Metro station (we wanted to try riding the Metro to Red Fort rather than take a cab), with written instructions on what stops to take, what to look for, provided maps, etc. Personal attention provided each day in a non-intrusive manner. The owners also gave us tips on places to visit in other areas of India that we were visiting on our trip and made us feel very safe and welcome while staying @ Shanti Home. The rooftop restaurant was also excellent in food quality, service, atmosphere, &amp; setting. The chef even made a special dessert for us when we asked for a hot dessert that wasn’t on the menu. The staff also remembered our personal preferences at each meal and remembered our previous conversations to ask us about each day.I highly recommend Shanti Home while visiting Delhi for an outstanding experience! "
shanti home ,Great place to stay What a great place to stay. Most helpful staff especially Pooja and a lovely terrace restaurant. I spent 4 nights altogether over a three week period in differently themed rooms which are delightful. This was the best hotel I stayed in whilst in India.I am definitely going to return to this calming Oasis in an otherwise brilliant but manic city. 
shanti home ,"Paradise Shanti makes you feel at home. They have a really good taste for everything: decoration, rooms, food, workers, reception and so on. I felt being taken care the whole time. They have the best tips about places to visit and where to shop in Delhi.I strongly recommend. "
shanti home ,"You will be a happy customer I am not convinced that this is the &quot;best&quot; hotel in Delhi but it isn't $500/ Night either &amp; the owner &amp; staff certainly make it the one I wold return to. It is close to the Metro &amp; far enough from the tourist locations to be devoid of the touts &amp; s..t on the shoe artists, who can make walking down the streets a miserable experience. One time we even (through sheer stupidity &amp; inattentiveness) got lost walking back from the Metro late at night. Several people helped us &amp; one man walked us many blocks to the hotel. This would not happen in a tourist area.Chef Adil runs a great restaurant. I especially recommend the Tandoori. The owner, Rajat Verma, was kind &amp; helpful. When I got sick he was nice enough to call be a stubborn fool, call a doctor, accompany the doctor to my room &amp; correctly identify the problem, Malaron. If you have done everything right and still get the quick step consider this as a problem. We were there during Holi &amp; Rajat was kind enough to inform us of the danger of traveling around town-just being covered with red dye. We were able to watch the wild parties from our balcony.Our only real complaint was that in the 5-days we were there our room was only cleaned once. "
shanti home ,"Om Shanti Home The best hotel I've been in during my 12 days through Delhi an Rajasthan...After 33 hours by train starting from Chennai, Oh Calcutta, my double bedroom, was quite an experience!Don't leave the place without having dinner in the hotel's restaurant: chef Adil will make your dreams come true!!! "
shanti home ,"Clean reasonable secure friendly service I booked 4 premium rooms for myself (Indian) and 3 of my Japanese colleagues for our business trip from4/28 to 5/3, 2008 through their website (No deposit or pre-payment). We were picked up at the airport with a Toyota Innova (minivan) for the same price of a Indica (medium hatchback) (Rs 650). After welcomed by garlands upon our arrival, we were introduced to our rooms and the facilities. The rooms were clean (almost as in the picture) with 24 hour hot water. Only shampoo and soap were in the bathroom. Our lady colleague were given a bigger, beautiful room with bathtub. The place is close to Uttam Nagar East and Janakpuri West Metro station. The former is closer, but walking by a busy (and smelly) open market in the hot Indian summer is not a good experience. So, better go to the latter with a cycle-rickshaw (20 Rs, 15 minues). Ask Pooja, always ready-to-help front desk staff to arrange for a rickshaw. Remember the route because while coming back you may have to guide the Rickshaw puller to the hotel. Janakpuri West (JW) Metro station is also next to a district center with many nice restaurants. Have some coffee at Barista after your meal at the Chinese restaurant (forgot the name). If you go to Rajouri Garden (4 stations in between from JW, there are 4-5 shopping malls to hang around there. Rajat, owner of Shanti home, suggested us 'Punjabi by nature' at Center Stage Mall (?), which was fabulous. The car hire from Shanti home were also reasonable with friendly and english speaking drivers. (@2000 Rs for an Innova, whole day). The closest gate of A-1 block, where Shanti home is located, is just left of Shanti home. Better remember that gate and the name of the street running in front of it if you are coming back by AutoRickshaw or taxi by yourself. The name is Pankha Road. I would suggest buying the Eicher Delhi Map (Rs 750) which is very detailed.Shanti home is little far from center of Delhi (Cannaught place), but if you are in Delhi for sightseeing, this is a cool place to stay with the reasonable tariff (125USD/night with tax, premium room, breakfast included) . Free high speed complimentary wireless, safety box at room, complimentary mobile phone, a nice relaxing breakfast, an open roof top restaurant to relax with few beers in the evening with some delicious safe food, almost 24 hour room-service, smiling helpful staff are some of the features you can hardly find in even high-priced five star hotels in Delhi ( I have stayed in The Qutab, Intercontinental, Nikko and know Maurya). Rajat and Sanjana (Rajat's wife and manages Santi home) will probably come to you and ask you how are you at least once during your stay. During our stay, one of colleague was lucky to have a very homely Happy B'day party with a complimentary cake and lots of wishes from everyone at Shanti home. Most of the clientele at Shanti home are westerners and few Japanese. Most of all, it is a secure place even for single lady and you will feel at home with the 24 hour customized service. Rajat told me he is opening a small gym shortly. My friend availed the 2 hour massage and steam bath for Rs1000, which according to him was reasonably good. All in all, after a hectic day in busy dusty (crazy ??) Delhi, you will definitely appreciate your every nice minute at this place. Good for singles and couples. "
shanti home ,"Such a comfort! I absolutely loved this place. From the moment my friend and I set foot in the hotel lobby we were cared for by the warm and friendly staff and owners. We were served mango juice and given fresh flowers while we waited to check in. The environment is peaceful and comforting which was a great relief after our long travels. I had my most restful sleep out of my time in India during the two nights I stayed at Shanti Home. The rooms are modern and very tasfully decorated. The rooftop restuarant is also excellent with some of the tasiest garlic naan and paneer tikka. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those visiting India for the first time. "
shanti home ,"fantastic So truly thankful we stumbled across the Shanti, the proverbial quiet oasis amongst the hustle. Small unassuming boutique style , much thought &amp; detal has gone into this establishment.Tastefully furnished rooms with luxuriant huge mattress. On a peaceful residential street so opt for a room on the front, no room tv you don't need it, I spent hours on the balony watching Delhi life happen by.Rooftop restaurant where the chef cooks everything freshly to order.5 mins walk from metro, 30 mins to city centre.Perfectly charming hostess/host, the host Rajat in particular is the ultimate smooser, whilst you enjoy your dinner he addresses all guests to ensure they've had a good day &amp; will assist above &amp; beyond.Staff very attentive &amp; seen to be treated with respect, they try very hard to get it right.Our endorsement with pleasure,stay here. "
shanti home ,"Great boutique hotel! We stayed at Shanti Home in New Delhi for 4 nights and loved it! The staff is fabulous whether it's the front desk (so helpful with everything!) or the waiters at the rooftop restaurant. The food is so spectacular it was hard to eat anywhere else (though we thought we should to experience India to the fullest). The rooms are very comfortable with big beds, soft lighting, and large bathrooms. Each floor has a sitting area with books and there is a free internet. The hotel is very stylish and comfortable. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the spa area. We got massages and didn't realize it wouldn't be the traditional swedish massage, and instead were treated to lots of slaps, hard kneading, and fast rubbing. It was strange coming from the US. The staff also answered their cell phones during the massage, which I also think we found strange due to the fact we're used to going to US spas. Other than that, we found Shanti Home to be a great new hotel with wonderful staff, convenient location, and nice amenities. We'll hopefully be back! "
shanti home ,"Perfection Shanti Home was a welcome final stop in our tour of India. Although we arrived very early my Father and I were treated extremly well, given a spotlessly clean room with every wish granted. This hotel is a gem in the city of Delhi, has fantastic transport links and the best staff anyone could wish for.This stay gave us very special memories of India!I'll be back! "
shanti home ,"I can't fault this beautiful hotel I decide to stay at Shanti based on the glowing reviews I had read on TripAdvisor from previous guests and am so glad I did. I absolutely loved this hotel. I had origianlly only booked for 2 nights but ended up staying at the hotel several nights on 3 seperate occasions while travelling to/from Agra, Jaipur &amp; Amritsar. The hotel is about a 15 minute metro ride from central Delhi but having spent a day being hassled in central Delhi I was glad of this. The metro station is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel and is extremely safe, clean, cheap and very easy to use. There are also some very good, modern shopping malls about 4 metro stops away or a short rickshaw ride away so I was very happy with the location. The hotel is clean, beautifully furnished and decorated and every room I stayed in was absolutely gorgeous. I can highly recommend the treatments provided in the spa, especially the facials which were fantastic and a great way to relax and wind down after a day of sightseeing and shopping. The food was great with the chef coming to our table every evening to ensure we were happy and had enjoyed our meal. The staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. They attended to our every whim and seemed genuinely pleased to assist us in any way possible. As beautiful as the hotel is it is the staff that make it extra special. I just can't fault the hotel in any way and would highly recommend it. "
shanti home ,"Nice hotel with remote location Shanti home is a nice place with beutiful and clean rooms. The staff is helpful but they charge you quite heavily for travel services (we paid 500 Rs for a 20 minute taxidrive to a nearby trainstaion. With a helpful driver but still quite heavy).They have a restaurant with fantastic food in the evenning and a rather confused service for breakfast.The hotel is situated in the suburbs, but only som 400 meters from the subway station. It takes about 20-25 minutes to the first junction and another 5-10 minutes to Connaugh Place. Not to bad but not to good either, and the walk from the sub way station to the hotel can be quite stress full at night if this is your first visit to India.We paid 5000 Rs for a standard room which seems to be quite good value in Delhi. "
shanti home ,"great place Ajai , new yorkMy delhi trip was short and sweet, stayed there for 4 days, far from airport but very clean, extra pleasant and helpful staff. owners Mr and Mrs, Rajat are very professional, hands on. tour drivers was very relaible. great food. &quot; licked fingers &quot; ( good job Chef Adil ). "
shanti home ,"Home away from home We arrived at Shanti house late at night with our family of 6 plus our parents. We were greeted warmly, with fruit juice and an offer of food on the roof top restaurant. Our rooms were all ready, clean, spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were also quite spacious. The hotel had arranged a van/driver for us during our stay which was so helpful since we were traveling with older people.The day we made the long drive to the Taj Mahal, the staff got up early enough to make us breakfast, packed us a snack/lunch, and were still ready and waiting for us when we returned at 10 p.m. so we could have dinner. All the staff was friendly, accommodating, and helpful - a gift when you are traveling with family from 8 to 77 years old!The food at the restaurant was very good, and we loved the breakfast choices as well. This hotel is a very good value for money in Delhi. "
shanti home ,"Great Value Stayed at the Shanti Home for 3 days. Even though this hotel is is a bit of a distance, with a 30 minute cab ride from the Delhi Airport and Raiway station the hotel is well worth it.A family run botique style hotel with excellent service. The hotel is very nice with all the comforts, and decorated with pieces of art throughout.For about $100 per night it is a very good value compared to some of the other large hotel chains in the area.It is also located within walking distance to the new metro rapid transit system ($0.50) which will take you downtown to New Delhi, and on to the Red Fort ($2.50 entrance fee) which is a must see while in Delhi.Hotel is highly recommended! "
shanti home ,"very nice insidegood restaurant for residents only From the outside,just a narrow home frontage but inside it is very homely and nicely furnished. Clean comfortable rooms, each room decorated in different Indian style. It is run by the owners and they are very helpful and go out of their way to assist.Take hotel directions from the web site as taxis will not find it easily. Better still, ask the hotel to pick you up from the airport/station.The restaurant is on the terrace, open to hotel guests only. It is small but very friendly staff and they will cook anything you want- their Indian meals are excellent.It is in a residential area so not much to see around but the metro station is nearby. We were 7 in our group, so had the restaurant and the Staff to ourselves most of the time.Each of the three floors has a common sitting area for after noon teas etc and one of them has a free lap top computer.Good value and a nice place to start or finish your India trip.The home is really in New Delhi but for reason we could not understand, it is classsed under Delhi in the Trip Advisor!Approx 20 min by car from the airport and 20-30 min to Delhi city centre. "
shanti home ,"Simply the best - forget the rest I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for two weeks. After two months of travelling I returned here on my stopover without thinking twice - this hotel is simply the best in Delhi (and in most SE Asia!!) on so many levels:1) Service: the service is professional and totally client-oriented. If you feel like a three course meal at 5 in the morning, it will appear in the hands of a smiling and friendly employee. No problem however great it may seem, cannot be overcome. I overheard a client who was unsure of the tube stop direction. The solution? An employee offered to accompany her there! Pooja and Anand will tend to your EVERY request.2) Cleanliness and Hygiene: the hotel is literally spotless. From the sheets to the seats on the rooftop terrace, everything is squeaky clean. Mosquito repellant plugs are provided and the whole place fumigated with incense to make sure that no unwanted visitors creep in. I am an obsessive over cleanliness where I stay. The Shanti Home Hotel won full points on this front and edged well beyond so called top-class hotels. 3) Quality: the food prepared is delicious. I dont mean that in a 'i've-been-living-off-street-meals-and-this-is-really-good' way. I mean that the chef (an unassuming genius called Adil) could win awards. He will make it his personal mission to satisfy your requirements, often going further than what the menu offers.4) Facilities: I had the pleasure of inaugurating the steam and massage parlour. In keeping with the rest of the hotel, the service is professional, value-for-money, clean and deeply pleasing. There is a shared TV room with an enormous flatscreen, reflecting the family atmosphere that the hotel tries to create (and succeeds). Wireless internet connection is provided free and the connection is excellent. Take my word for it - this is a rarity in these parts of the world!!!The list could continue for example, I have not begun to do justice to the friendliness of the staff and its owners, the way you arrive as a client and leave as a friend.Ultimately, it is clear that the owners have sat down and worked out EXACTLY how to create the best value-for-money hotel possible. The fact that in many respects it also outclasses even the big five star names, makes this the hotel of choice in Delhi.So where is the catch? You might complain that it is not bang in the centre of Delhi and that you dont have a flatscreen in your room. Fair points but the tube is nearby and frankly I didnt miss the in-room entertainment. You cant get it all but 99% out of 100% is not bad is it!!!!!BIG thank you to everyone there. I have never written so effusively about a place and doubt I will again. Go there and see what I mean!!!! "
shanti home ,"A little gem I rated this place 5 out of 5 based on value for money.Communicated by email with this place a few times before my arrival and all emails were replied to. Driver met me at the airport as promised.Upon arriving at guest house after midnight, was sat down and offered a chilled glass of juice (much appreciated). Staff were super friendly, spoke good english, and room/bathroom were spacious and clean. Free internet was on offer.This hotel is not 5 star with all the fancy trimmings, however you can get this in Delhi but expect to pay US$400 to $500 at some impersonal hotel. Breakfast was delicious and served up on the roof.I really couldn't fault this place and if I ever visit mad/chaotic Delhi again, I would definitely stay here!GrahamAUSTRALIA "
shanti home ,"Fantastic What a great place, starting from the friendly airport pickup, the experience in Shanti Home is great. The staff are extremely helpful and provided me with tea at two o'clock in the morning upon my arrival. There is free wireless and the rooms are spotless and of very nice design. The property appears to be only have opened recently. "
shanti home ,"Charming hotel excellent staff We booked our stay after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com. We stayed there for four days (Feb 6 until Feb 9) and we loved both the hotel and the staff, who was very friendly and did everything possible to make our stay convenient. The rooms are charming, the missing TV did not disturb us at all. There is a free wireless internet connection on the first floor, and the restaurant on the roof top patio is excellent. Would defenitely recommend this hotel, to families as well as to single travellers or couples. "
shanti home ,"Fntastic like visiting friends We stayed our first night in India at the Shanti Home, they have created a haven from the madness that is Delhi. They provided us with every comfort, helped with travel plans and made us feel at home, the rooms are spotless, beds extremely comfortable. We returned to stay with them for our last night so what better review is there. "
shanti home ,"Shant Home = Our Home in Delhi Shanti Home is a particular place with a very special charme and with a Team, which is an extra class in kindness, attention and service quality. We enjoyed our stay very much, despite the fact that Delhi was very cold those days and the roof garden restaurant was a little chilly in the morning during breakfast, but when the sun came out it was a fantastic place. Rooms are very special and decoration is done with apparently a lot of good taste and love to detail. We can recommend highly this place as your home while you staying in Delhi.Stephan, Roswitha and Little Simon "
shanti home ,"Apprehensive This being our first trip to India. We were rather apprehensive about staying in a non 5 hotel, 20 min outside the centre of Delhi. However we took the risk and we were glad of doing so. The Shanti home was great, excellent value for money. The rooms were clean, the bed very comfortable (we stayed in the Bollywood room) the service was courteous and friendly. The food at the roof top restaurant was superb in fact it rates amongst the best meals we had on the whole trip. Shanti home is close to the Metro which is safe and easy to use. We did do a bit of local shopping, the area is not great however we found it less hassle to shop, as we did not bump into any Hawkers or Beggars, they seem to congregate more in the City centre. Over all the shanty home was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone. "
shanti home ,"Blissful Calm in Chaotic Delhi!! Firstly let me tell you this is not a hotel its home!! The quality of care and service here is fantastic. The staff here wants to help you and will make sure you get what you need. The chef will cook a specail dish of your choice, The girl at the reception will tell you where to go in case you need to buy a special souvenier, the housekeeping guys will make sure that your room is spic and span...in short everyone will go that extra mile to make your stay comfortable "
shanti home ,"Highly Recommended! A home from home indeed! Shanti Home is a boutique hotel that has everything you need - an oasis of calm, immaculate and well presented rooms, great food and attentive/personal service from the staff. Its based west of Central Dehli. To get to Central take the metro. There is a metro stop 3 mins walk from the hotel and the journey takes around 20-25 minutes at a cost of around 20 rupees. Trains every 5 mins. For something a little closer, and if its shopping you're after, there is a huge modern mall about 6 metro stops away that has the usual western brands (Adidas, Levis...etc) and a few good Indian and Western eateries too. Only one minor negative point was that on both occasions there wasnt enough hot water for the 2 of us to enjoy a long hot shower, but we may not have understood what all the taps in the bathroom were for!!!!!!!! Overall, we highly recommend Shanti Home - it was a great place to start an Indian adventure and to come back to at the end of a fantastic holiday in Rajasthan! Louisa and Ben, UK. "
shanti home ,Comfortable Clean and Really Nice Definitely a place to reccomend to travellers to India. Personalized service they really care and great coffee...i mean real coffee. Travelling to and from the hotel is real easy as the metro train which is surprisingly clean and efficient has a stop next door.

sheraton new delhi ,"Excellent service We spent a night in the ITC Welcome Sheraton earlier this week having stayed at several different hotels in Delhi and in Agra during our visit. The Sheraton was without doubt one of the best hotel we stayed in (see review on Intercontinental Eros Place). One piece of advice, be sure to print out the full name and address of the hotel before you travel, as there are several Sheratons located in different parts of Delhi and drivers get really confused.We booked a king bed room on non-smoking floor and we were pleased to be informed upon arrival that we were upgraded to a club room and we were promply brought to the club floor lounge for happy hour drinks and snacks while we checked in. The hotel and our room was modern, clean and well-equiped, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The selection and quality of food in the hotel was surprisingly good. We will definitely stay there again next time in Delhi. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Sheraton was the best part of our trip to New Delhi The best part of our stay in New Delhi was the Sheraton hotel. It was the only place in New Delhi where we were treated like royalty and not stared at constantly because we were Indian Americans.; we actually felt welcome. The amenities are a plus with a Spa and beautiful pool. The complimentary breakfast buffet was amazing with international cuisine. The room was clean and the bathroom was the best out of all the ones we had encountered through our tour of India. The staff was very kind and attentive from the minute we arrived at the airport until our departure . In fact at our departure we were lucky enough to have a representative of the Sheraton, Manoj Kumar who was with us every step of the way as Air India gave us a very difficult time with our luggage and its weight. His quick thinking and experience allowed us to receive a minimum charge of 50% of what Air India wanted us to pay originally. We were grateful for our stay in the Sheraton because it ensured a smooth visit. We will definitely be back. :) "
sheraton new delhi ,"Modern comfortable hotel Very comfortable, clean rooms, spacious and modern bathrooms, I enjoyed my stay at Sheraton almost 100%. Very helpful staff, good buffet for lunch.Draw backs: There was the smell of fresh paint in the floor. Internet charge IR 700 per 24 hours. "
sheraton new delhi ,excellent service staff i celeberated my birthday in this hotel the staff were prompt and effecient and they were brilliant in every aspect the birthday cake was yummy and beautiful prepared by thier lady chef. and the location of this hotel is great especially if u r a foodie and shopahlic and movie buff. i have no doubt to say they have best malls around walking distance in india yes in india.and people in this part of delhi r genuine and honest if u compare with other parts as it is located in elite part of southdelhi. which isconsidered to be themost affluent part . though for tourist it may be a bit far from tradional tourist spots but i must say it worth a shot. i hope u will enjoy a great service from thier staff as i did. 
sheraton new delhi ,"Perfectly acceptable but not outstanding accommodation I'm willing to admit, my judgement of the Sheraton New Delhi has been clouded somewhat by glorious stays in other properties managed by the ITC Welcomgroup in India, (also operated under the Sheraton franchise), so this place was going to have to do a lot to really stand out! My employer selects, and pays for, my accommodation when I travel, so I can't comment on the value of the nightly rates, or how they compare with other hotels in the chain. The Delhi property, while maintaining a high overall standard of both accommodation and service, seems lacking in a few of the 'little things' which can really make a stay, and which differentiate other properties in the group. First off, the 'Sheratonisation' process seems to be continuing apace! I understand that having the backing of a huge, well-respected and popular brand is of great value to both the group and their customers, but the small differences which gave the Indian hotels more of a 'local' feel seem to be disappearing, to be replaced by the generic 'Sheraton' model. This isn't a huge thing, I know - and indeed, some might welcome the familiarity - but I always used to enjoy the seemingly 'exotic' bathroom ameneties made in India and the like! The public spaces of the hotel have a modern feel which, apart from the ever-smiling doormen bedecked in their traditional outfits, could almost be anywhere in the world. The rooms themselves are what I have come to expect, with high ceilings, lots of dark wood and plenty of wardrobe space. I am sure some will think me picky, but the standard of the rooms here in Delhi are not as high as elsewhere, (and I'm comparing a regular, non-executive floor, non-marvellous view type room here!) Again it's the little things. The mini-bar - which I never use, I'll admit, and often empty straight away to restock with my own bits and pieces - looks like it hasn't been attended to in a while and is practically empty. There is one glass to drink from and, unlike at other Sheratons in India, no swizzle sticks, straws, coasters etc. There is no iron or ironing board in the room, and I suspect this is common across the board, (so to speak!); while a quick call to housekeeping will sort this out, it would be handier if there was an iron to hand for when you need it!The bed is huge and comfortable, so no complaints there, (and after all, isn't that the most important thing?!), plus there is a cosy two-seater sofa with a coffee table, which gives an idea of the size of the room. Flatscreen TVs seem to have appeared since my last visit, (not a big draw for me personally, but everyone seems desperate to get the things in their rooms these days!), and there are three telephones in the room and bathroom, so you've no excuse to miss a call! The workdesk area is organised in a corner layout, which makes it easy to use. International visitors will also appreciate the 'multiplug' sockets in the room, (I have spotted two!), which seem to cater for all of the various plugs from around the world, (though check on the voltage first!) There's one by the workdesk, and another beside the bed, so handy for charging the mobile overnight!The bathroom is, comparatively, quite small. It is however very pleasant and loaded up with ameneties. The shower is over the bath in this room, unlike at other properties which feature a separate shower. There are plenty of mirrors throughout both the room and bathroom, so if the lighting at one doesn't work for you then another will! Service at the hotel is not as gracious as I have come to expect from Sheratons in India. I'm not expecting - and never appreciate - staff falling over me, but it is quite common to pass by staff in the hallways and for a pleasantry offered not to be returned, or for a smile not to be reciprocated. It's not that thay are being rude; it's just that I have come to expect and appreciate a smile from time to time! Equally, the concierge, while accommodating and obliging, seemed somewhat unenthusiastic and requests from myself and colleagues were met but with little good grace!I am sure there are worse places to stay at, even within this price bracket. What is disappointing, is that I KNOW this could all be done so much better, (and is being achieved elsewhere in the ITC Welcomgroup chain!) As I say, I've been spoiled somewhat by previous experiences elsewhere; a bit more effort and the Sheraton New Delhi could easily match, and exceed, these experiences. "
sheraton new delhi ,Great Decor. Great Service The ambiance at this hotel is great. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful. The helped plan my entire stay in Delhi.Great Place to be. 
sheraton new delhi ,"obtain good directions(possibly to another hotel) Imagine driving down from District Kangra(on a good day, about 15 hours), having a heat stroke in Chandigar, both your drivers having a good command of English and Hindi, arriving on outskirts of Delhi and they call the hotel to obtain directions. Then, over two hours later, apparently due to misdirection from hotel staff, finally arriving, Delhi traffic notwithstanding. The room(and amenities like slippers, robes, etc)reserved for two is prepared for one. The SPG lounge insists on beverage service for only one guest even though there are clearly two in the party. On check-out and preparation to airport the first vehicle in the line is clearly not suitable. Finally when speaking with SPG Guest Services back stateside you are told that the hotel provided you with complimentary transportation tot he airport, clearly not the case.On the plus side, luxurious public areas and sumptous brunch buffet-a real effort to &quot;regain the confidence of the guest,&quot; somehow falling through. Somewhat of a departure from the usually excellent Sheraton/SPG customer service. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Very good Hotel Nothing to say about the hotel staff, the rooms and the amenities, as everything was perfect.We didn't triy the restaurant and breakfast, but the only neagtive thing is the location...It's a little bit outside of the center. If you need transportation, just take a rickshaw outside of the hotel and never ask for a taxi, as the taxi is going to rip you off.Going back to the hotel can also be problematic, but fortunately, there's a larg shopping center just around the corner of the hotel, so just indicate the &quot;City Select Mall&quot; in the Saket Disctrict to go back to the hotel.The mall is also a heaven of peace in Dehli. Don't go there for shopping, just for the air-conditioning and peacefull place! "
sheraton new delhi ,"Very nice stay Had a great time staying and visiting Agara too., "
sheraton new delhi ,A great memorable experience An excellent property at a decent location in New Delhi. It is a Five star property - so the usual five star facilities are available. What I recall best is the quality of food at the restaurant and range of liquor. It has an excellent check-in &amp; check-out facility. 
sheraton new delhi ,"Loved the Food I stayed at Sheraton New Delhi during business trip and found it to be absolutely wonderful experience with great food choices-North Indian, South Indian and really good Asian variety. On top of food variety, the hotel staff was extremely sensitive to the guests needs which made the experience even better. "
sheraton new delhi ,Above average!!!! The hotel is ok in all the senses. Only thing that makes it a bit difficult that the staff members do not have enough experience to deal with esteemed travellers. The ambience of the hotel is good and amenities are acceptable. 
sheraton new delhi ,Could have been better My experience was not that great as per my expectations. This was my 3rd visit to the same place and after giving constant feedbacks in my previous stays i thought they woudl take extra care of the little things that were missed previously. but to my surprise nothing much was done. Things like giving a non-smoking room even though you mentioned that you want a smoking one. It was terrible hearing the fire alarm go on and then seeing everyone gather outside your room. The food could have been a little better. Bell boys efficiency is anothe rthing for them to look at. Overall i would say that i was satisfied but not delighted with my stay. 
sheraton new delhi ,"Good Business Hotel I've stayed at the Sheraton, New Delhi several times over the last few years.I would rate it as a first class business hotel. It has a very good range of restaurants for the discerning business traveller.The service levels are on par with the best business hotels in India.The rooms are clean, hygenic with all the regular frills that one is used to in a sheraton hotel.On the whole, a good enjoyable experience, though definitely a trifle more expensive than a Lemon Tree. "
sheraton new delhi ,"bad reception It was bad experience at reception, As per contract I can have two breakfast &amp; I avail the same. However at the tiome settling bill recpction was unaware about this . It was very bad time at reception. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Ok but could do better Stayed for 3 nights at the end of a weeks business in Punjab. Upgraded to exec floor as we like the convenience of the lounge and extra facilities. Rooms were well finished in a traditional style with a very good stock of amenities. Good room and night service with home made biscuits and fruit daily. Large bathroom again well stocked.First night arived very late and ate in the buffet 'Bay Watch' restaurant. Not recommended, despite it being marketed as 24 hr the food was past it's best, the staff were not that attentive or helpful and the grill chef quite surley. Complained to general manager during our stay and had the food bill refunded.Pool staff were very good and nice area to sit and relax (may near ear plugs for traffic - thats just Delhi)Also the exec lounge is fairly small both breakfast and afternoon canapes were very poor. I asked for a boiled egg on the first morning only to be told hot items were not available in the lounge. I later found that this was not true and hot items could be ordered. Also we found staff being more concerned about what was on the TV than tending to guests.I do like the Sheraton group and am heartened that my complaints to the manager did receive prompt attention, this would cause me to come back again but I do think they need to check on how there business is being delivered to the customer. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Stay here whatever you do I have travelled India a lot. Stayed in one star to 5 star hotels sometimes regretting the outrageous costs for little return. But not here, this hotel and it's highly trained super friendly staff border on over servicing. I have long been used to indifferent service and staff that bordered on insubordinate.The Sheraton New Delhi surpassed my most optimistic expectations in all areas and to boot the food was nothing short of amazing. Dont miss this place if you can afford it. Then on the other hand, can you afford to miss the experience?The hotel managers name is Rishi. This man will ensure your stay is one to remember. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Wonderful experience I've spent nearly 3 weeks a month here in this hotel since August 08. Great hotel with real 5 star facilities. Staffs are extremely friendly. Though lacking of restaurant and connected shopping center, you could still get to one of the biggest mall in Delhi in less than 5 mins cab ride. If you are a SPG gold member, you can even get a free room upgrade and late checkout at 7 pm!!! Obviously I got that ... "
sheraton new delhi ,"OK but there are much better '5 starts' in India I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with my stay here. While there was nothing serious that went wrong, I was just left underwelmed. The property is looking a bit tired, the rooms also. The staff were poilte but not the usual attentive lot that I usually find in India. I' ve stayed at better hotels in Delhi. On a positive note, room service breakfast was very tasty and served very promptly. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Nobody Gives You India Like Sheraton I just got back from a business trip in Delhi, India and spent most part of the week in Sheraton Hotel, Saket, New Delhi. The hotel is above average, the facilities are good, the location boggles me, but the service is excellent. I stayed there for three nights checked out for another night then checked back in for another three nights. When I checked back in, they saw the feedback I left for them during my first stay and did what they could to make my experience better. The bed and bath linens were clean and plentiful. I wasn't a big fan of the pillows they had in my room, but they offered a pillow bar where I could choose pillows based on what my preferences were. For some days, I switched the Privacy switch on and Housekeeping called me at least once to confirm that I didn't want to have my room cleaned. I got a king size bed, and I paid INR 7300++ (lots of taxes!) for the bed, the big bathroom, a couch and a work-table. Unfortunately, I was out for business for most part of the week so I wasn't able to appreciate the facilities of the hotel. My room didn't come with a view but I doubt it would have been any different anywhere else in the building. The room comes with complimentary breakfast, but for someone who has been into buffets at Sofitel (Spiral) and Shangri-la (Circles) in Manila, the selection paled in comparison. If you're looking to travel elsewhere watch out that you don't plan your day to early, breakfast doesn't start until 7am. As hotel prices go, the prices for in-room dining are limited and steep. Food quality and serving sizes are pretty good though.Overall, I'd say it's a good hotel to stay at. I'd recommend it to anyone travelling for who and what's in it, but not for where it's at. "
sheraton new delhi ,"nice but could do better First of all the hotel is okay just not great, don’t hesitate about staying there but there is better available. We needed to book last minute because of a change of plan and needed an overnight near the airport, so I checked trip advisor for recommendations. The hotel stated it is 30 minutes from the airport, which is why I chose it, but it took us an hour! However it was still wonderful to pull up to this oasis from the abominable Delhi traffic. Booked with [--] 14,000 rupees per night for 2 executive rooms inclusive of drinks, hors d’ouevres 5-8pm and breakfast. We arrived at 7:56pm and unfortunately were no longer entitled complimentary drinks etc which was a little annoying.Rooms are spacious and great beds but a clock somewhere would be nice. Although we had two rooms booked only one had the upgraded amenities, fruit, chocolates etc. It may seem a little sexist to the west but as female travellers it was nice to be on a female only floor.Probably the worst part of the stay was the restaurant Pan Asian. The décor is dated. The cooking stations are not adequately ventilated which resulted in making our eyes sting and cough from the fumes, we couldn't wait to get out. The food was sloppy, tasteless and over priced. My local takeaway is superiorBuffet Breakfast in the lobby is 7-10:30 with a wide variety available, although by 10am most options were empty and not refilled. I asked for poached eggs and was told it would take 10 minutes, after 40 minutes they hadn’t arrived and we left.Stay at the oberoi. It’s better, cheaper and you have an inclusive luxury airport transfer. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Good balance of price location niceness Sheraton New Delhi was our first hotel experience in India. The room was large, comfortable and clean, although the carpet was dated and for some reason always seemed damp. The bathroom was huge and nice. The front desk staff were great - very helpful in giving advice about obtaining taxis, etc. Food was fine - standard buffets but with a wide variety of options. The location turned out to be fine. It's close to a couple significant sites that we may not have otherwise made it to (Q'tab Minar and Humayun's Tomb), but if I return I may pay the extra money to stay closer to the city center. We did not get to do much walking around b/c it's too far to walk to Connaught Place (or other sites in that area), and the taxi ride can take a while when traffic is bad (took over an hour one evening to get home from CP). Overall, I'd stay here again if I was planning a few days in New Delhi, but for a shorter visit, it may be more fun (though louder and definitely more expensive) to stay closer to the city center. "
sheraton new delhi ,new delhi hotel sheraton I had a great stay in sheraton new delhi it is one of the finest hotels in delhi ..... simply super..... 
sheraton new delhi ,"Good hotel but far away from the action I stayed for a night at the Sheraton. The hotel is around 30 minutes from the airport and is located in a quiet residential area of Delhi. Check-in was smooth and the room was excellent. The hotel itself is well maintained. I was on a business trip and would recommend this hotel for people on business, but not necessarily for tourists. There's really not much to see in Saket and it's a bit of a trek to get to the interesting spots. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Great hotel Beautiful hotel, the rooms are spacious and well equiped and furnished. Great for business and leasure travellers. Fantastic pool. Excellent restaurants. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Just what a business traveller needs in India.... We stayed a week in New Delhi, several days in Imperial and several in Sheraton. Sheraton is very efficient, staff really tries to do their best in terms of service quality.The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are quite stylish! Good testers, including an indian brand of nature cosmetics, which we liked a lot.Restaurant serves wonderful food, bith local and international cuisine (although pasta bolognese was as far from real one as india is from italy). We were quite cautious with food at first, but had no problems at all (unlike in Imperial)...The lounge and bar area is great, with live singer every day, huge windows overlooking a garden, decent choice of cocktails and human prices.The most surprising thing was an email from the hotel after I returned to Zurich, saying that I had left a body lotion in the room and they were willing to ship it to me...How sweet! Even given the fact that I would more than certainly have to pay for shipping - it was still nice of them to get back to me. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Great Experience I'm not a fan of paying very high sums of money for business stays in India but when I stayed for 1 night at the Welcom Hotel - the experience, product and service was so good that I could not help but rate it to my international hotel stays. From the fully loaded rooms to the A+ food in the coffee shop, the gym, the executive lounge with the fresh orange juice - all of it was a great experience. I paid USD 300 per night which to me is unaffordable but at USD 150 I will come back again and again. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Great service average rooms mediocre food As its name suggests you are made to feel welcome from the minute you enter and pass by two tall Turban clad men who salute you. The entire lobby floor is impressive - ideal for large families or groups who like to laze about the lounge and for kids who love toilets that have tv screens in them.The rooms, however lack the added luxury touch other 5 star properties in Delhi have. We sampled the food in the 24 hours buffet restaurant and in the pan asian restaurant and found both to have excellent service but mediocre food. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Great option if you get a good rate and have transport arrangements It's been quiet a while since i stayed here, and back then I had got a great package deal at this hotel. Room was luxourious, nice, spacious, marble bathroom and all. Overall our stay here was enjoyable.Only downpoint is that its far far away from the main part of city and most tourist spots and in Delhi if you dont have your own transportation, you will find it almost impossible to find a local taxis and autorickshaws, and if you do find one, be absolutetly sure that they will RIP YOU OFF.Despite the poor location, if you are getting a good rate here, and have your own tranport, do not hesitate o stay here coz it is a fine fine hotel. "
sheraton new delhi ,"Pretty good I was satisfied with my 1-week stay. My room was decent size, bed was comfortable. Only 4 hangers in the closet, that was not good for a 5 day stay obviously. Internet access was convenient. the hotel isn't really in any interesting area, but is convenient by car.The breakfast buffet was decent. I'd stay there again, I think it was good for the price...but there are a few more luxurious places in Delhi for a little more money, and it's probably well worth it to splurge on one of those. "

shervani new delhi ,Looks are good but be cautious The hotel's interiors are good but the food and the bed were not at all good. The hotel does not have Room Service. A big Upsetter. Another thing is that it is located in a quite remote area. 
shervani new delhi ,"Low budget business class hotel - heart of delhi Hi,Stayed in this hotel a couple of times. Pretty neat hotel &amp; in a good price. Around 5 K's, it is value for money. The facilities are good &amp; the connectivity from the hotel to any part of Delhi is simple. The location is quite near to India Gate.The breakfast offered is good &amp; I have seen quite a few Americans &amp; European's staying in this hotel on their business trips. Defenitely Value for money. "
shervani new delhi ,"Very nice place but overpriced and with an attitude. I have stayed here once sometime ago. The place is beautifully constructed and the rooms are quite stylish. The menu is too westernized and choices are limited. The food is okay, not great. The staff has a bit of an attitude and looks down upon Indian travelers as the place is quite popular with western tourists. "
shervani new delhi ,"Bleak Hotel in Upscale Neighboorhoor Hotel looks great from the outside. Don't let that fool you. It attempts to be a boutique hotel, but it just missed the mark completely.Lovely, quiet, and safe neighboorhood about 4km from Connaught Place.Deluxe rooms are tiny, full of mosquitoes. Bathrooms are sleak, but not very clean. The service generally friendly but not extremely helpful.Hotel has WiFi, but it was SLOW and could only purchase access one hour at a time.Breakfast and restaurant were lackluster. I am pretty sure it was hotel food that was the cause of my food poisoning. (&quot;Delhi Belly.&quot;)I was shocked to learn how much my firm paid for this travel. (We used travel agent in India to make our India reservations, and I am sure was getting some sort of kickback). Deals in the areas at 4- and 5-star hotels (the Oberoi. LeMeridian, Shangri La) seemed to be much better, yet we were stuck here because our reservation was prepaid.Stay away. "

shervani new delhi ,"Decent Accomodations for the Price - but with some problems. Delhi is an extremely expensive city for accomodations and overall we were satisfied with Shervani. That said, it comes with issues. The Positives: It's in a decent location not far from Old Delhi and the popular tourist sites. The rooms are a good size and the staff was friendly.The Negatives: ROOMS: DO NOT get a room facing the front of the hotel. Demand one at the back. There are a pack of neighborhood dogs that howl ALL NIGHT LONG. I'm not a light sleeper but was kept awake the majority of two nights due to the insanely loud barking. I realize this isn't the hotels fault - but get a room toward the back. Also, I had to have the staff change the sheets to our bed as the &quot;clean&quot; linens had blood stains. I've traveled enough to be used to stained sheets - however blood stains I couldn't deal with. To the staffs credit they changed the sheets right away and replaced them with clean white ones. -- Also, after getting a room toward the back of the hotel (by night 3 I couldn't take the barking anymore) our new room was very large but the bathroom had no hot water. RESTAURANT: The restaurant is &quot;okay&quot;. Breakfast is eggs and cereal, however our first night there we ate dinner at the restaurant and bugs from the ceiling lights above kept falling into our food.... Despite the negatives, I still think this is a decent option in Delhi. The city is so expensive and Shervani provided a safe, clean (with the exception of our first set of sheets) room. If you are simply looking for an affordable place to sleep at night this is a fine option. "
shervani new delhi ,Good Location and great rooms This hotel has a wonderful quite location near the Delhi zoo. Modern and sleek the staff seem a bit aloof and distant but were very helpful. Maybe a bit overprized but a very good option in a city that can be a bit overbearing at times. Walk to the nearby SUNDAR NAGAR market grounds for brilliant food and antiques! 
shervani new delhi ,"A dissapointment We were disappointed with this hotel. It gives the impression of trying to be ultra modern but ends up being rather unwelcoming. We could not face a meal in the very bright ,cold feeling restaurant with tables packed closely together, even though we only saw a couple of people eating there. The buffet at breakfast was very limited and the worst we had during our stay in India.The rooms were of a good size but, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the TV has only Indian channels. The bathroom tried to be really modern but the area around the bath was cracked and chipped and the sensor operated light and fan that came on even when we were not in the bathroom was very annoying.It was one of those infuriating hotels where you have to slam the doors hard to shut them and so if you want a lie in or a snooze before an early morning flight, as we did, forget it!There was a mini bar but it was empty and the only way to get a beer was to call room service.It is true that it is in a quiet location but it is some way from the centre and impossible to walk anywhere for a meal or shopping. There is no bar and no public lounge area, so it is just your bedroom to relax in. "
shervani new delhi ,"Not worth the money..... Well, being first time in India, didn't know what to expect and was surprised for USD180, the hotel is doesn't live up to expectations but then again hotels in India are expensive in big cities!!!Arrived very late in New Delhi as in most international flights to New Delhi and by the time I reached the hotel which was in a secluded residential area, was shocked that the hotel is nothing but something like a terrace house that was &quot;reconstructed&quot; into a hotel. The exterior of the hotel looks good but the restaurant was pathetic when I arrived late for a dinner, the so called buffet dinner is pathetic with 5 dishes at its most and breakfast was equally bad. Nothing fanciful and nothing to really comment about. I would rather eat toast for every day during my 3 nights stay there. Coming back to the rooms, they are clean which I think is the best this hotel can offer and the choice of channels was limited to Indian channels compared to what was promised on their TV programme list. When I asked the reception about it, they say that you have to re-tune on your own which was a big disappointment. Service was so so with staff saying they do not have adaptor for my laptop which is important as I was on business trip.Close proximity to the exhibition center is probably why this hotel is expensive. Not much to offer within the vicinity and you do not really want to step out once you are in your comfy room.Given a choice, would not want to stay in this hotel again but given the expensive rate for hotels in New Delhi, it would be tough to find similar clean hotels at this rate I guess "
shervani new delhi ,Really quiet and clean hotel with powerful showers! Our stay at Shervani was great- the room was spacious and clean with a very powerful shower! The hotel is located in a very quiet and safe area and the hotel staff is generally very friendly and helpful. Great value for money. 
shervani new delhi ,"Great until checkout A friend booked our stay at Hotel Shervani in New Dehli. I was most concerned about cleanliness of the hotels. Since we were only staying in New Delhi for one night, we did not want to pay an exorbitant amount to stay in a luxury hotel. Pros: A pleasant surprise. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. The food was delicious (but we were hungry) and the front desk was very courteous and helpful (arranging taxis and such).Con 1: We were so pleased with our stay until check-out time. When we reviewed our bill, there were 2 outside phone calls that were made on our bill. The only interaction that we had with phones was receiving calls from another room in the same hotel at night. The record on the bill showed that a call to Calcutta and a call to Delhi had been made during the afternoon (we were not even in the hotel at that time...we were in Agra at the Taj Mahal!). We asked the front desk about it and at first, they acted as if they did not believe us because the calls were recorded. After a period of attestation, the front desk said that they would ask their supervisor and would refund us if they saw that we were telling the truth. We were not concerned about the money (it probably amounted to less than $2), but rather honesty. Our assumption is that whoever went in our rooms to clean it, made the calls. Fortunately, nothing was taken.Con 2: Most of the drivers did not really know where the hotel was located (I think it's fairly new). It's located around the corner of the main row of hotels.Overall, were it not for that one incident at the end, the stay would have been perfect and I could say that I'd stay there again. It's a really good deal for the cleanliness and amenities. However, it's a shame that this one incident could really break the trust or honesty of the service.I give it &quot;excellent&quot; for the accomodation, but &quot;poor&quot; because of our checkout experience. I hope that others did not experience this incident...such a shame. "
silver ferns hotel ,"i'd give this a miss I stayed at this place for a couple of nights and it was not the best experience i had.the rooms are ok, and the bathrooms are small.It's supposed to be a botuiqe hotel, but it fails to live up to any expectations. it is located bang in the heart of a business district, so that is some saving grace. If getting a good night's sleep is ALL that you are looking for, you may consider this place. However, for the price u pay, there are many, faaaaarrrr better places on offer. I'd give it a miss.PS: Dont even bother with the food. just step out and into one of the MANY restraunts that are a hop skip and jump away. "
silver ferns hotel ,"I really liked this hotel. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews for this hotel because I really liked it. My room was clean and modern. The hotel is not located in a central part of Delhi, which, to my pleasant surprise, I liked. It provided me with an opportunity to walk around a more residential area that one normally would not see if staying in a more central area. It is off a plaza with stores, theatres, (too many) chain restaurants as well as some independent ones. The garbage on the plaza the following morning was substantial (but it gets cleaned up).I agree with the other reviews about not getting the hotel to call you a taxi - they gouge you big time. There is a taxi stand diagonally across the plaza just past the movie theatres. Rates there are good. I simply walked over to the taxi stand, negotiated a good rate, and asked them to come and get me at the hotel (so I didn't have to lug my bags there).The breakfast was okay. Nothing amazing, and the dining room itself is not terribly inviting.I stayed here for one night only as the last night of a tour (supposedly because it's closer to the airport than more &quot;central&quot; hotels, but I'm not sure that there's really much of a difference). Because I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour, I don't know what kind of rate was charged, so can't comment on value in that regard. "
silver ferns hotel ,"Nothing wrong with Silver Ferns Wife and I stayed here for 2 nightsbefore tour of Rajistan and 2 at the end.Before we go I read reviews as I always do to see what other travelers say about places where we stay.We have to disagree with nearly all who give Silver Ferns such bad opinion.Hotel is 35 minutes from airport.Rooms are very pleasent and tastefuly decorated.Good aircondition.Tea,coffee facilities.Fridge was out of order.Complimentary 2 bottles of drinking water a day..Basic breakfast but you can order eggs made to to your requirenats.No ham,sausages or cheese.Next door to hotel is a pub (serving food but really bad one).Outside hotel you find chinesee restaurant,pizza hut and a subway as well as McDonald and 7/11 store.Reception staff was pleasent and helpfull.Honestly its nothing wrong with Silver Ferns. "
silver ferns hotel ,"Don't let them call you a taxi! Our Rajistahan tour started at the Silver Ferns Hotel.I guess it is an OK one night stop, it is in a small market area crammed with Western eateries like Mc Donalds and Subway a 7 Eleven and right next door to an Irish Pub.The rooms are adaquate and seemed clean.Breakfast was a very meagre buffet in the basement, the room was not inviting and the food even less so.We asked the porter to call us a taxi to go into New Delhi, they tried to tell us the fare was RP1000, we thought his too high and tried to pay the driver directly at the end of our ride only to find the hotel had told him they were settling the bill.Our return taxi was only RP400; the hotel front desk tried to charge us the RP1000 but we refused and paid them RP500 after lengthy argument. (we learnt they only gave the drive RP400 and were trying to keep the rest for themselves).Unless your tour starts at this hotel I would not recomend it, you can do much better as it is barely three star in my oppinion.Possitive note: it is handy to ATM's and 7 Eleven "
silver ferns hotel ,Not bad We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. The hotel was clean and comfortable and breakfast was great. Don't think it really deserved the 4 star rating maybe 3- 31/2 would be more appropriate.Location was good but a fair distance from central Delhi.Some hotel staff were helpful others were snooty with no reason to be.Would stay there again 
silver ferns hotel ,"O.K LOCATION This hotel conveniently located in a small suburban shopping area in a nice part of delhi There were available good cafe/dining facilities, clothes shops,bookstore(great selection and cheap)., ATMS and cheap internet cafe .Although in the centre of this village, our bedroom was not noisy.The hotel was adequate, but on world scale not worth the 4* it was rated. I would give it 3*only.Room facilities were average as were other amenities. Small lounge area with small Reception..T he breakfast and dinner were good. "
silver ferns hotel ,"Absolutely ghastly !!!! Warning dirty hotel !!! I stayed in this so called hotel over the Christmas period 2007 and it was terrible and dirty. The bed linen smelt awful like it hadn't been cleaned after many guests had slept on the sheets!! There was NO HOUSE KEEPING i.e. the rooms were not cleaned whilst you were out. It is mis-represented on it's website showing you pictures of the horel that do not exist !!! No bar, banquenting facilities or spa as suggested on website and the food was sub-standard. We had already been charged for our stay and they didn't even pick me and my elderly mother from the airport but charged us a transfer fee! This is not a hotel and provides very little value for the money they charge. It is a dirty little B n B if you can call it even that ! We checked into the Sheraton after 3 days and it was marvellous and about the same price as this hovel !!!!!PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE !!!!!!!!!!! "
silver ferns hotel ,"Good Position A new hotel,situated in Saket Shopping Mall.Comfortable,clean room.Meals are good,but if you want your fix of take away food,McDonalds,Subway &amp; Pizza Hut are at your door.About 40 minutes to Airport no problem with noise.Good value. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Decent Hotel I don ´t know whether those who disliked this Hotel hadn´t been to another Place? Surely, the picture of the front of the hotel doesn´t indicate that it is squeezed in between other buildings, but the pictures show definitely suncourt yatri. The Hotel is not bad at all , especially in comparison to other Hotels upcountry. About the value, i can´t say much, the price was included in our tour. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,Nice enough but not good value The hotel is clean enough and the staff are friendly. Breakfast on the roof was probably the best part. We booked a room and notified the hotel we would be arriving at 2:00am (not ideal). We had to haggle on price for the rooms and they kept changing their minds. It was however a relief to see the car waiting for us at the airport and to find the hotel clean and the staff friendly. Our a/c unit conced out on the first night and never worked again but this wasn't a big problem. On the whole hotel and staff are good but value rating is low. 
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Keep away Suncourt Yatri is pretty foul - it doesn't look like the photos. Our first room had a barred window as this was on the main floor just behind the desk. There was a musty smell and we could smell smoke throughout the night as people smoke in their rooms and also in the corridor and it does not help that the kitchen is in the basement. The staff at the desk are incompetent. My brother had called 5 times on the day we were to arrive at the hotel and despite giving them my name and the tour group we were with ( the tour operators gives the front desk the names of all the people in the tour in advance) was told that there was no such person expected that day. After two nights we left with the tour group to arrive back on our last day. This time we were given a room on the fourth floor. This was better than the first room with at least a window to look out of . However, the room had a smoky smell and we had to run the fan all night. The people at the front desk are not very helpful and are ready to rip you off. We tried to arrange a taxi to visit some friends about a 10 km ride. We were told by our friends that the taxi should at the most charge 100-150 rupees. However, the front desk told us that it would cost 400 rupees and refused to consider anything less. We left the hotel with our luggage and then hailed taxi which charged us 250 rupees. Hence, all in all a poor hotel with devious staff and I would not recommend it "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Nothing special look elsewhere if possible I booked the Sun City hotel but ended up at this hotel since they apparently (that's what they told me) are related businesses. I found the front staff were not as bad as the other hotel, they were actually ok, but the rooms were not really that crash hot considering how much I had paid on the internet and the real price which was probably at least half. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"would highly recommend this hotel! I stayed at the Hotel Sun Court Yatri for two nights in October 2007. I was nervous about choosing this hotel because it was only listed as a 2.5 stars, and I had been told never to stay at a hotel below 3 stars in India. When I arrived I realized that I had nothing to worry about - this hotel should be at least 3 stars, and it was much nicer than many of the 3 star hotels I stayed at in India. My room was a good size and very clean. The shower had hot water (something I didn’t have in every hotel I stayed in in India). The room had a TV and internet access was available for free in the business center. The staff was very friendly. I was offered a free breakfast. The hotel restaurant was good for both breakfast and dinner. The location seemed fine - although I didn’t do much walking around the neighborhood. I took rickshaws and taxis to the places I wanted to go. The Hotel Sun Court Yatri is approximately a 45 minute drive from the international airport and the price of a taxi to the airport was less than $10. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The only drawback was price. I probably could have gotten a much less expensive hotel in Delhi and been ok. However, if you’re not overly concerned about the price (and the price is incredibly reasonable compared to hotels in any U.S. or European city) &amp; if you’re looking for a clean, safe &amp; comfortable hotel with a friendly staff I would highly recommend the Hotel Sun Court Yatri, also hotel owner Mr. Shubh Taneja very helping he had give us lots of tips about the city that’s help me lot. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Shocking Hotel Avoid this hotel at all costs.Service is terrible. Rooms are dirty &amp; very noisy. A/c does not work in many rooms. Rooms are tatty, Bathrooms filthy and smelly.Fire detection system/smoke detectors in our two rooms had been removed.Reception staff rude &amp; ill trained. I had to show them how to process my credit card.Hotel will quote one price then rip you off on check out by adding charges &amp; taxes that don't exist.Rooms badly constructed, I could see into the room nextdoor &amp; hear everything though a gap in the wall that you could get a hand through.Bare electrical cables in bedroom.DO NOT STAY HERE! "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Do not book here. I booked 5 rooms with this hotel two weeks in advance - confirmed via email twice, just to be positive. I also called the week before arrival. My group arrived at 4pm on the day of reservation, only to be told that I had never confirmed the reservation. After I showed the manager my two emails from the property, he said that they still did not have rooms for us. No apology was offered.If you book with this hotel, do so at your own risk - they will not hesitate to lie to you. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"Awful Terrible Horrible We had email confirmation from this hotel for 5 rooms, but when we arrived the desk clerk said we did not. We showed him the email that he, himself had written but it didn't matter. There were no rooms. This turned out to be very lucky for us because we toured some rooms and the place was pretty gross. Ganesha was in our corner as we found an excellent, clean place to stay next door. The Suncourt is definately one to avoid. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"decent place helpful friendly staff After a very bad experience my first night in Delhi I wandered around the neighborhood and found the Yatri. It was basic but clean with a friendly, helpful staff. It was a bit noisy but so was every other place I stayed in India. They room was a reasonable size for 2 people and had a small refrigerator. I paid about $50 US. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,"realy pretty foul its realy pretty foul,doesnt go on photos,small congested rooms,you cant move freely,in toilet only thin person can sit or move,average cleaness,too costly. "
suncourt hotel yatri ,Pretty foul Suncourt Yatri is pretty foul - it doesn't look like the photos. Our room had a window that opened into an aircon vent and it looked like it was last cleaned in 1974. the rooms are very noisy so don't expect a good night's sleep. Staff were helpful and friendly.

svelte hotel and personal suites ,"A Very Smart 5 Star Hotel This hotel, connected to 4 or 5 different shopping malls, is first class in all aspects. The suites are excellent; clean, tidy and well maintained. Exellent breakfast in nice dining room. A very enjoyable place to stay and rooms a good size. Nice to have kitchenette &amp; dining room separate from the bedroom. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Home away from home The suites literally give you a feeling of being “at home” albeit in more luxury and comfortable surrounding! While the approach to the hotel is quite bad (thanks to the traffic due to the adjoining shopping malls) once you forget about it all once you are inside the premises. The reception is small and cosy with every helpful and courteous staff. We have stayed in the hotel nearly 6-7 times over the past one year and never had any complains! The suites include a living room, a bedroom and a small open kitchenette. Quite ideal for families with kids as you can whip up a quick meal in your own room or warm milk. We usually buy stuff from the adjoining malls like croissants and eggs to enjoy it later in the room. The bedroom and living room each have a large LCD which is a bliss since you do not have to fight with your partner over the remote! The breakfast buffet is quite okay – since we have quite a many at this place we find it monotonous else it is pretty satisfying. The inroom dining has limited options but top of the world cooking! The rates have been lowered recently – maybe due to the increasing competition nearby – there are 100s of eating joints within walking distance so you have a lot of choice! The internet access is quite expensive - more than what they probably charge at Taj but it makes up for the overall comfort of your stay. The hotel is in midst of a mall which has a multiplex so you can spend a weekend without actually moving out of the hotel – movies, games, shopping, dinner, its all under one roof! "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Great Hotel - well designed rooms. Soft Beds ! Book on makemytrip.com for best rate. Even the Executive suite is big. The only issue with this hotel is the fact that they sell the internet access at 800 Rps/day. Also the hotel taxi svc. is very $. Great location for shopping &amp; eating, even food court food is good - check out Haldirams @ DFL mall next door. Also Cofffee Bean café in CityWalk mall had best café latté I had in all India. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"When can I go back?? The Svelte is the perfect escape from New Delhi's organized chaos! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms are immaculate and spacious and the breakfast buffet is entirely satisfying. If you enjoy shopping the hotel is literally attached to a giant mall!It is located in South Delhi and our rickshaw drivers were reluctant to take us anywhere for less than Rs 150! We got them down to Rs 80-120 most of the time. It usually took us at least 20 mins to get anywhere but it was worth it given the respite of our hotel from all the horns. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Surprising Svelte The Hotel was spotlessly clean. The suites were very well appointed &amp; very spacious. Staff were prompt &amp; courteous. Parking was also convenient &amp; access to hotel was easy. The attached Select City Mall to the hotel was an added plus, allowing diversity of restauraunts &amp; shopping.Rooms were better than other 5 star hotels in Delhi. The hotel is pretty far away from the Connaught Place area, but if you have your own car, it should not be an issue to drive 30 minutes. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"pleasantly surprised The approach to it isn't great and from the outside the hotel looks ordinary. Checkin/reception area isn't much to speak of but once you enter the room, it's a different story. Very impressed with the stay. In fact, i stayed in a suite since they didnt have enough single rooms and it was a 2 room, living room+kitchen area and very nicely designed. Spacious, modern, clean, enough privacy, comfortable beds, good bathrooms and accessories, room service was great, food was also fresh and hot when it was served, good business services, flat screen tv, remote controlled lighting and airconditioning, closet space was good, dining area was good and even had a decent breakfast buffet. It had a full fledged kitchen with utensils, microwave, refrigerator and pretty much a full-service apt. Definitely recommend it if ur on business or even personal trip. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Excellent hotel very helpful staff highly recommended. Large rooms with everything you could want. Staff very helpful with arranging car and tours etc. Reception spent 1 hour on phone sorting out my fouled up tour accommodation. Ajoining Shopping Mall is big bonus as there are restaurants, cafes as well as shops, also plaza area where you can walk without being accosted. Mr Uniyal the Assistant Manager Front Office could not have been more helpful. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Modern and comfortable This is a modern hotel . Access is a little difficult at the moment , as there is building work going on all around. It is adjacent to a new shopping complex 'Citywalks', which has shops like Mothercare, Zara, Adidas, United Colours of Benetton etc. KFC and Pizza Hut are across the road! This is the face of the new affluent India.The room was very spacious, with a lounge, fully equipped kitchenette and a modern and attractive bathroom. It had a flat screen television in both the lounge and the bedroom areas!The swimming pool on the roof was fine, with comfortable seats and loungersThe breakfast was good. The dining room was sad however, at level minus one, with no windows.There is an internet connection - 300 rupees for 30 minutes.The service was good.The location was fine for the airport but not for sightseeing. The centre of Delhi is well over an hour away in the car. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Very nice hotel large rooms but expensive and not in an ideal location in the city When we got into our room we were amazed at how big it was, you walk first into a lounge area and then there's an adjoining corridor into where the bed area is. Bathroom is nice, there are two widescreen TVs in both the lounge and bedroom areas, as well as a little kitchen area with microwave, hobs, pots and pans and cutlery! In the room there was also a torch provided, dressing gowns and slippers as well as other amenities you'd expect to find in a hotel like this. The hotel service was very good, all the staff spoke very good English and very friendly and polite and remembered us when we came back to stay at the end of our holiday, although in this kind of posh hotel in India they'll try and do everything for you and then expect a tip of about 100 rupees for it, eg. holding your shopping bags for you and taking them to the room, and serving your food onto your plate at your table in the restaurant.The worst thing about the hotel though is probably its location in South Delhi. It's next to a shopping mall which is good if you want food such as KFC or Pizza Hut, but apart from the music shops the prices are the same as in the UK. Also, in the Delhi rush hour traffic it takes about TWO HOURS to reach places in central Delhi like India Gate or Connaught Place by car, there's no Metro connection here as far as I know. So the location wasn't great. Also DO NOT use their taxi for an airport transfer, it costs 27 QUID as opposed to probably 500 rupees for a prepaid taxi!So overall this hotel has big rooms which are going to be good for entertaining business guests because of the separate lounge area when entering the room, the staff's English is very good, but the price is high and location within Delhi itself is not great, "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"oasis of calm in new delhi Just right for a one night stay - calm, clean and quietly efficient. I returned a month later on a business trip - as a single woman it was a good choice. A relief to move about without hassle in the Mall. Dinner in the Spaghetti Kitchen in the Mall was A1. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Would stay again Stayed for two nights on a business trip in a two bedroom suite with a colleague, great rooms. Very clean and well maintained. Room package included breakfast and hotel transfers to and from aiport. Location next to a very big and very western style mall is good although the entrance to the hotel is somewhat a bit of a suprise with the road to access it still being built and entry is from the back of the mall.Very good service from staff overall. Was somewhat miffed that internet while payable in the room was on a per computer basis and not a per room basis! We had two laptops.When we asked about taxis out of the hotel as the hotel entrance had no taxi stand, they of course suggested that we use their services, which were 4 x that of a metered taxi. We took it for one morning as we were running late for a meeting, and then were able to get the green, yellow and black metered taxis back each night and also asked the same taxi come get us the next morning. Assume you could probably get a metered taxi from the taxi stands at the shopping mall? We also returned after a day trip to Agra and booked a single room for 1/2 day use. Hotel allowed us to use our return airport transfer fromour earlier stay in the week during this stay, which was good. Although when we did check back in asked about the transfer they said yes, it was available on a chargeable basis. We had to tell them that we had already confirmed on checking out previously that it wouldn't be chargeable. They had to check and got back to us to say we were right.One other thing that was a bit of a dampener was that as we checked out on this second stay they had someone check the mini bar while we were checking out and said that we had taken a soda out of the mini bar when we hadn't. There were a few phone calls going back and forth, and am sure they told the person checking the room to check the bins in the room to see if there was any signs of the empty soda can/bottle. They didn't charge us for it - but requested that I write on the bill that I was not taking anything from the mini bar out of the hotel. Wasn't very impressed with that at all.Apart from that mishap at the end, I would still come back and stay again as it is definitely good value for money compared to other 4 &amp; 5 star hotels in New Delhi which are exhorbitantly over-priced. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Excellent rooms-lacking in some amenities Recently stayed here for several nights. Complimentary collection from airport a huge +. Excellent staff, rooms spacious with good facilities, spotlessly clean, very comfortable. Access to broadband costs additional RP800/day which is irritating when you have paid USD300/night. Breakfast is OK with comprehensive range of different foods. Hotel is located within modern shopping mall which could be anywhere in the world but does have several bars and good restaurants. There is only a small bar in hotel, gym is just about open and there were problems with swimming pool. Hotel has service whereby gustes can have meals prepared for theim in their room-didnt make use of this service but seems a pretty good idea as the guest can choose menu. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"The ambience was amazing and impeccable Date Visited : Nov 10, 2008I booked the hotel for my honeymoon and the first impression was just amazing. The hotel staff at the reception was very courteous. The lobby, lifts, corridor was neat and tidy. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. As soon as I enterered the room it just left me with half of my mouth open. the room was very spacious and tidy to the best of the levels I have seen across the globe.The kitchen accesories was clean and ready to use. I was surprised to see that there was no fridge in the room but to my sheer contarary a 360litre+ refrigerator was there in the room with outliner same as the furniture and it was difficult to recognize that what I believe is a almirah is actually a fridge and the actual almirah is just amazing having multiple shelves. The fridge was full of drinks and juicesThe living room was decorated with nice paintings and the sofa was very comfortable. The Bathroom was very spacious equipped with all the latest fittings. The bed room has nice single sofa seat and huge dressiong table.It was wonderful wonderful experience and I strongly recommend this Hotel for the people who wants to speand a tension free night . This is a great property with amazing staff starting from Hotel Booking to the person who took my luggage from my room to my car..In simple the Hotel is Amazing and Awesome "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"A haven from Delhi! The previous review is spot-on, so I won't repeat the points made.The suites are located on the City Skywalk complex, currently being built (so it looks like you are entering a building site). This is reputedly the most expensive shopping mall in the whole of India, it is of the same standard but nicer than Bluewater in Kent - with similar prices. That means that only rich Indians or tourists go there.We would not have been able to stay in an equivalent place in any country that we know of for the price, which is bound to raise as the place becomes more popular and they finish the building work.Only one poor point, the check-out was dreadfully slow as two businessmen were disputing their bill, our tour manager had to step in or we would have been late for our plane. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,"Good Choice I stayed at the suites for 3 nights on a recent business trip to New Delhi. The hotel is strangely located in a high end mall, of which phase 3 is under construction. But if you have travelled to Delhi, this can be good thing, as hotel locations are sometimes hit or miss.As an all suite hotel it has minimal lobby and dining (although 24 room service available) but the adjacent mall offers many dining options, from coffe shop to high-end restaurant. Breakfast was good with traditional and western offerings. Service was good and attentive. This place will not give you a &quot;taste of Delhi&quot; because of it's location, however I thought the suites were spacious and well appointed, full kitchenette, large bathroom, cleverly designed with a definite modern flair. Beds are comfortable with nice duvet and comfortable pillows. Living room area well designed to meet or work, with plasma TV and comfy furniture. Hotel has a nice rooftop pool with yet to be opened gym. Staff was friendly and efficient.Internet connection was dreadfully slow (although they make you pay &quot;high speed&quot; prices at 800 IR per day) . I arrived on the day of the latest terrorist bombs went off in Delhi, so security at the hotel was insane. When I reached the hotel I did not know what had happened earlier so I thought the 7 checkpoints and full body pat-down were a bit much, but then realized it was only temporary.All in all a good place to stay if on business, not too far from Gurgaon. "
svelte hotel and personal suites ,fantastico 
taj mahal hotel ,Loved the pool side We really loved the hospitality and it was the great experience staying at Taj! 
taj mahal hotel ,beyond business Stay was comfortable Staff was curteous attentive professionalism all around 
taj mahal hotel ,"Quiet and very comfortable 11th floor room with city view was very quiet. 7 by 8 meter room with green carpet, slightly stiff pillows. 42&quot; flat-screen TV, DVD player available. Amenities included fax/phone, mini-fridge, white marble desk, amoir, fresh fruit, safe, white marble bath (with shower ), built-in AC electrical adaptors, personal wake-up calls. Great service. "
taj mahal hotel ,"The Best in New Delhi This is a fabulous hotel especially if you stay at the club level with butler service. While pricey, everything is exactly the way it should be. Rooms are clean, service fantastic, food is wonderful. After all the noise and crowded streets of Delhi, it is so nice to be able to return to this oasis. The gardens are fantastic at night - just a great place to relax. The Taj does it right. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Excellent hotel excellent service - great place to stay in Delhi We stayed here for two nights right at the start of our holiday. I wanted to stay somewhere nice coming off the back of a Business Class flight.The Taj Mahal in Delhi didn't disappoint. We were met at the airport by a hotel car - we had a transfer as part of the Club Room - and whisked to the hotel. Upon arrival we were given cold towels to freshen up and checked in with a freshly squeezed juice.The Club room also gave us access to the Club lounge where for an hour or so every evening you had free drinks and nibbles. Staff there were very friendly and went out of their way to help you...and give you a good drink!We were then shown to our room, nice and spacious with a view of the pool. Bathroom was decent and came with Molton Brown toiletries.We spent a little time down at the pool which is nice and big - 30 metres plus - with plenty of chairs and recliners to sit on.One evening we dined in Varg, the on site Indian restaurant. While expensive for India it was excellent value for the UK and was absolutely delicious. The food itself was tasty, modern and well presented. The mushroom starter my girlfriend had was especially good, as was my lamb main that came in an earthen pot.Breakfast both mornings was simply amazing. A huge selection of fruits, cereals, breads &amp; pastries, Indian and Western hot buffet and a omlette / pancake / waffle bar. The masala omlette was the best I had of several in India!One evening we dined out in Old Delhi - an utterly mad and hectic place - at Karim's. It was full of locals, dirt cheap, and the food was awesome! Especially the freshly cooked naan breads. It might not be for everyone - it is a little hectic as I said - but for me it was an insight into the real Delhi.I'd highly recommend this hotel if staying in Delhi, it is a good base to go exploring from and is a real haven to come back to after the huslte and bustle of Delhi. "
taj mahal hotel ,"loved this hotel taj mahal situated in prime location in city provides easy accessibility to airport.taj mahal hotel treated us as family friends rather than guests.the service was great and the staff was very friendly and cheerful.staying here is like experiencing royal treatment .the food was awesome.u can take the benefit of the following amenties - massage centre,internet access,fitness centre,bar,gym.... &amp; many more.u can easily access most popular attractions &amp; sights as located nearby "
taj mahal hotel ,"Impeccable yet friendly service We arrived before our room was ready, so were given another room in which to rest. A white-gloved gentleman brought us tea and fresh fruit. The room service was elegant and prompt. The concierge ever helpful. As our time was limited, they arranged a car and driver for half a day with a couple hours notice. The bellman helped me repack some last minute purchases. All in all, this is a very elegant yet warm hotel. Worth every penny. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great Place for Celebration We arranged our office Party in hotel Taj, New delhi. We enjoyed very much. Such a good hotel. we were feeling great at that moment. Some per sonal thing began from that place. I found my new love there.... "
taj mahal hotel ,Awesome expreience with Taj We celebrated our wedding there and it was a awesome expreience with TAJ and we also spent our 1 st night at taj it was seriously a quality time spent at taj which i cant forget in my life...thanks to taj for making my day a memorable day of my life. 
taj mahal hotel ,"Fantastic hotel This was a fantastic hotel which oozed decadence. We had stayed in Taj hotels elsewhere in India and had similar experiences but this one topped the lot.The resturants were varied and wonderful.My young children were well looked after and catered for. You were greated with freshly squeezed juice in your room, as you arrived. Belgian chocolates and other luxuries. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Ignore the exterior - this is a fine hotel We arrived at 4am after a 13 hour drive due to a cancelled flight. We were quickly &amp; efficiently checked in by extremely well trained &amp; friendly staff. The room was lovely &amp; luxurious. Included breakfast was excellent. The swimming pool was large enough for sensible use &amp; the hotel had every amenity one might expect from a genuine 5 star hotel. The bar was expensive but very good. The only Indian restaurant in the hotel served pretentious nouvelle cuisine type food which was amusing, if expensive. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Amazing experience My wife and I stayed in Taj Mahal Hotel on the 27th and 28th Nov. We reached the airport around 4 AM in the morning. The airport pickup car was already there and our ride to the hotel was smooth. Immediately upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a receptionist outside. Our luggage was taken by the bell boys for security screening and we were told they will be brought straight to our room. Sunita showed us to our room. The in – room check in was one of the smoothest check in I have ever had. The room was nice with very comfortable bed and a brilliant city view- overlooking the India Gate. The flat screen 42 inch TV kept us entertained whenever we needed it. As part of the Taj club lounge access we were treated to complimentary tea/coffee, soft drinks all day. At certain times of the day they had free sandwiches and savories etc and in the evenings a selection of cocktails (all complimentary). Just remember that Taj Club lounge is on the 8th floor. This was something that wasn’t told to us during check in. So if your room includes taj club lounge make sure you ask about it during check in. The hotel’s lobby was very impressive with very nice décor. The swimming pool is huge and is attended at all times by cleaning staff. The hotel staffs are very friendly. From the security guards to the managers people showed genuine interest in us. Breakfast was very good as well and included a wide variety of choices from Indian to continental and fruits and yogurt.Overall I must say that you get your money’s worth when staying in the Taj Mahal Hotel. Only negative thing that I can point out is that they charge you for using the Wi-Fi, which I believe should be free for guests staying at the hotel. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who loves luxury but is not afraid to spend a little extra to get it. A definitely 5 ***** experience.PS : Thanks to all the staff for introducing India to my wife. "
taj mahal hotel ,"So good..... We had 3 nights at the Taj as our starting point in India.It was great. The room was lovely (club level) and very clean. The room was serviced twice a day and fresh fruit and nibbles were always replenished.The staff were friendly and helpful. The pool was so refreshing after long days sightseeing! The concierge organised a driver each day to take us sightseeing. This was very inexpensive, and such a great way to get around (about $30AUD for 4 hours).Fantastic! "
taj mahal hotel ,"Another great Taj property I stayed here a few days while sight-seeing in Delhi. As I've come to expect from the Taj chain, this hotel was great. The rooms were large and comfortable; mine included a nice view of the capital. The bed was soft. The bathroom was large, with a separate tub and walk-in shower. There are a couple of fantastic restaurants inside the hotel, including a Chinese placer and a sushi place. The service was impeccable, with people available to help me with all of my needs. Best of all, there is a huge, deep pool in the back of the hotel. It was perfect for swimming and lounging... "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great Charm A great hotel with its very good services, and delighted interiors of the room as well as outdoor. Very nice food and its varities are so good. No hotel is as like TAJ. BUt it is costly. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Quiet comfort and outstanding service. I stayed in this hotel several times for varying numbers of nights, using it as a base for short trips from Delhi. The service was friendly without being over familiar - there was a feel of a 'family' hotel. In spite of the size and busy-ness of the hotel, staff quickly learnt my name and routinely addressed me by name from the doormen up. Similarly, staff in the various restaurants and cafes quickly learnt my likes and dislikes.My room was comfortable, always spotless and the views over New Delhi are fantastic. The calm, friendly but always professional atmosphere provided a welcome escape from the pressures of Delhi in monsoon season. The main India restaurant, Varq, is worth a visit in its own right. A 'fine dining' restaurant, presenting traditional Indian food with a modern twist, staff are happy to advise on which selections will work well together and will discuss which dishes are hot, mild etc frankly and honestly. Potentially stressful situations were quickly resolved: laptop failing to interface with wifi - a technician came to my room to sort ot the problem within minutes, car booking overlooked (I had alot of cars, I'm not surprised that one slipped through the net), no problem, cars are available 24 hours a day, I still arrived at the airport in plenty of time for my flight with the minimum of fuss. As the person who is usually dealing with someone else's crisis, it was genuinely refreshing to stay here.I'm trying to work out how soon I can get back... "
taj mahal hotel ,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in This was one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome and important, even though we were not staying in an expensive suite. We were given a great room with a pool view, which I would recommend requesting. The room was a good size and came with a small couch and coffee table for relaxing. The bathroom was very large, with both a stand-up shower cubicle and a separate bath with shower. There were plenty of towels and great toiletries.The bed was comfortable and there was a great selection of English-language channels on the television, as well as a DVD player and complimentary DVD rental service.We used the pool on both of the days we were staying there, and received complimentary chilled mineral water while we were sunbathing. It was also possible to order drinks as there was a waiter service, and we were also given complimentary fruit kebabs.One of the best things about this hotel is the bars and restaurants. On our first night we went first of all to Ricks bar, where we had martinis. The staff were most helpful and booked a table in the Chinese restaurant for us, and also gave us complimentary cocktails to try! The food in House of Ming is the best Chinese food we have ever tasted…it was simply incredible, and there we ordered food and were also given some complimentary dishes to try which were beautiful.On our final evening we ordered room service, which did not disappoint. My husband ordered a curry and it was lovely and came with complimentary poppadoms, and then when we had finished they returned with complimentary Indian desserts.We really enjoyed Delhi, but would return just to stay in this hotel again! "
taj mahal hotel ,"My first choice when in New Delhi Definitely my first choice when in New Delhi, a bit pricey, perfect service, comfortable clean rooms, very good varity of food for breakfast, spacious gym, affordable internet access, and good location. Beware of the touts with the 3-wheelers outside of the hotel who always (!) will tell you that Khan market is closed, on the other hand even though I never took their service I have a lot of fun with them. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great service. Very professional and accommodating. Refreshing for an Indian hotel. Very flexible management. We had 9 in our group. We called Friday at 3pm looking for a place to stay that night. During this season they had a discount on the rooms. Warning: Luxury tax in India dictates that the tax be applied to published room rate, not the rate you actually pay. Anyway, the manager gave our whole group a very late check out the following day so we could all have fresh showers before being on a plane for 16 hours.Room service was good. Great selection and variety of food available. Decent prices considering a 5-star hotel. Didn't particularly like my meal. But plenty of food. Dining in the restaurants was very good. Food quality was good. Again, prices what you would expect for a 5-star hotel.Rooms were well equipped. Bathrooms were very nice. Beds super comfortable. Not Indian style mattresses. We ordered a short tour of Delhi. The car was excellent and the driver was professional. The tour operator was good and I'd use him again. Another misunderstanding in the car charge. I had to pay an extra 500 Rs for going over the mileage limit - even though that was never explained to me and the tour was only 3 hours instead of 4. "
taj mahal hotel ,have money in the pocket it was an average experience...but have traffic in the locality ... 
taj mahal hotel ,"5 Star Service Location:Taj Mahal Hotel is situated at one of the best localities in New Delhi. It is very close to the Diplomatic centre of Delhi. Khan Market is the best Place to shop Near by. Also there are 3 to 4, five star hotels giving you a plenty of options to dine and wine. Close to the city center conought place. Location: 5 starHotel:Hotel is supposed to be one of the best, it has 4-5 Restaurants, you have a real multi cuisine option. Varq, (The Restaurant) the specialty of Chef Hemant Oberoi is a signature restaurant here. Also the hotel has everything that a 5 star hotel should have gym, pool, Jiva Spa.....so on. The lobby is simply amazing. The hotel has its own armada of luxury cars. The infrastrucutre of this hotel though a little old is upto the mark. You would not need to go our anywhere to find anything, you'll get everything at the hotel. Room:The standard room that i stayed in is actually pretty descent and spacious. 350 sqft to be precise. The rooms are subtle and elegant with a lot of functionality. You can even custom design you bed with the choice of Cushions, linens etc provided by the hotel. The bath is fairly OK. All standard rooms are equipped with fax machines, a great utility for a business traveler. All in all great satisfying experience.Service:This is what i would like to talk about, they make you feel as a Head of the state, Check in procedure is really fast, in fact you are first taken directly to your room and then all the other procedures are completed. Excellent staff, really helpful and smiling makes you feel warm and comfortable. In room dining is a treat, they set your table in an utmost delightful manner. There was a small problem i faced during my stay was when the evening turn down service was not done. On complaining the same was done in minutes, the hotel even took the pains in finding out why such an error had happened 5 days later the front office manager called me at my residence apologizing for the same and promising of it not happening again. This shows the sheer dedication and commitment of the staff members. Excellent business services are available at the hotel. The concierge too is efficient and quick. All in all I would give the hotel a big ***** for excellent service quality. This is truly the Best Taj property. Taj lives upto its reputation, TAJ MAHAL is a truly luxurious experience. "
taj mahal hotel ,Service par excellence I travel to Delhi for business quite often. The place where I always stay is Taj Mahal Delhi. The rooms are beautiful &amp; luxurious. Why i feel this hotel is great because of the service level. The guy near the lift remembers you name &amp; floor. Greets you every time with a big smile. Their bar is really good. The club floor is really exciting. The only drawback of this hotel is the food. The swimming pool area is really nice &amp; peaceful. 
taj mahal hotel ,goes to prove that shangrila delhi is the only safe bet in delhi it started with the lights in teh room not working...but thats ok as that can happen and they reacted quickly to move me out in 5 minutes....the fun began when i ordered the dinner and they sent warm white wine...yups.... and they could not udnerstand what i was complaining about... after which they figured and sent me the wrong wine although to be fair it was chilled now !!!the less said about the FARCE of security checks the better but all said since it is a Taj property i will try them one more time as maybe it was just me..... though this goes to show again that the shangrila is the only safe bet in terms of consistent service 
taj mahal hotel ,"Utterly Amazing. Beats any other 5 Star htoel ive stayed in My goodness, Firstly I regret having only discovered the joys of TripAdvisor recently.So I felt compelled to write a rather tardy review of my stay at the Taj Mann Singh in March 2008.My goodness, nothing short of an absolute pleasure. I dont think that it would be an over assertion to say that my experience epitomized what staying in a hotel should be about.Staff were so polite, friendly, attentive, nothing was too much for them.The hotel was superb the pool, the rooms, the grounds.Mmmm PS those who like Paneer, try it at their in house restaurant! HEAVEN!Sublime.Cant wait until March next year. Taj Mann Singh here I come!!! "
taj mahal hotel ,"Fantastic hotel - service rooms and facilities excellent I stayed here on business in July and was thoroughly impressed.Rooms, service, restaurants , gym and bar are all world class.Though the price is high, if you can find a good deal or are lucky enough to be able to stay here anyway, I would recommend that you give it a go.I am a frequent visitor to Delhi and having stayed at many 5* hotels across the city I beleive this one must be one of best at the moment.

The hotel is busy 24 hrs check ins and check outs happen all day long ,just sit around in the lobby lounge and you can kill your time well, if you dont have any other work. Its got a nice bar also. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Beautiful I stayed at Taj Mahal Hotel only for 2D/1N but like other Taj properties, this one was simply luxurious. Hospitality was awesome, food - just what you can expect from Delhi. View was a bit on the disappointing side - I'd a pool side view. Room was luxurious with a huge bathtub and all the accessories one can expect from a five star. Rates are a bit on high side, but Taj properties give you more than value for money. The hotel is well located with close proximity to key business hubs and is recommended for both business and leisure purposes. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Fine Food and Comfortable Rooms The best part of the hotel is the wide food selection - one of the best joints to eat in the City. Great Chinese, Japanese and Indian selection. Rooms are basic but very cosy. The pool is set around a garden. Service is the best in its class "
taj mahal hotel ,"worth the price I used to dine frequently in the coffee shop of the taj and in other restaurants, that's when I cared to join their loyalty program and decided to book a room to stay for one one night and forget all tension and true to its reputation it did not let me down.had a wonderful time and Ricks the bar is amazing place to just chill and have a few drinks with your mates "
taj mahal hotel ,Very good An absolute must stay in delhi.Everything is exceptionally brilliant here. Has the wasabi and other renowned restaurants.rooms are lovely and client service is very good 
taj mahal hotel ,"Outdated overpriced and tasteless The hotel is practically located, close to Conaught Circle, but with no facilities in the direct vicinity.My room was upgraded to a mini-suite, which meant a series of small connected rooms on the inside of the hotel, with most windows looking to the hallway (not directly outside).Apart from 2 flatscreen tv's, which some will see as a luxury, the rooms were a bit outdated with the most uncomfortable chairs one can find.The gym had 2 modern treadmills and 2 cross trainers, but had no staff present, maybe because the smell was so bad that I left after 10 minutes. The bar was empty and looked like one of those places where 6 staff come to you to help you, after which no one will remember to bring your order (you must have experienced this before).Finally, the breakfast area resembled more a youth hostel with (again) these flatscreens with the morning news in hindi. Not great if you want a quit breakfast.Overall, on all points, the hotel scored very poorly, despite price of over INR 9000 per night. "
taj mahal hotel ,Great hotel to stay.. good service. value for money!! I had visited Delhi long time back and stay at Taj hotel. my experience with the hotel was very good.Complete value for money.

taj mahal hotel ,"Grossly overpriced - but Taj service I found the Taj to be excellent in service, but the hotel is just grossly over priced. The food is great, and the pub at Ricks is excellent for us middle aged people. At half the price, I would recommend it strongly. Hopefully the commonwealth game will introduce new supply of hotel rooms and reduce the rents at this hotel too. "
taj mahal hotel ,Memoriable Taj A Memoriable Experience. The Rooms are very clean. Stayed in one of the Club Rooms. The Service is remarkable and the Taj is really a Memoriable Experience. 
taj mahal hotel ,"Really ROYAL It is a herritage building and simultaneous proximity to the cultural legacy and epicentre of ruling political power centre makes it so very unique. Everytime while driving down the road, where thousand boots rock to offer presidential salute on Republic Day, to TAJ had made me feel something royal and proud. Pardon my childish excitement but TAJ mansingh is different from TAJ Aguada, Goa or the GATEWAY series that TAJ group has been offering for middle class family like us.The natural greenery overlooking the swimming pool and lawn is soothing at its first glance. Still parrots and pigeon wake you up from the comfort of designer bed. The silence all around allows you to catch up with yourself.There may be different types of room, but mine with our corporate discount was clearly the best value for money so far I have witnessed.The room naturally is excellent in its decor and ambiance. The buffet breakfast is interesting and really healthy - I can say that it is too pampering. The cheese array is surely requiring a closer look.The dinner is MING is what I indulged and trust me it is true ethnic chinese. Any more word is superflous - you need to try it out. "

The service was great and all the people were very friendly.Jet Privelage Number = [--] "

taj mahal hotel ,"Very Royale Treatment Superbly located in the HEART of Delhi, every aspect of the Taj Mahal Delhi was a treat to the senses.Got here in the night and honestly did not have too much time to look around and enjoy the hotel. But from the bell boy's smile right up to the hostess' introduction to the various features my room provided ---- it was all quite royale!Breakfast was a buffet in the restaurant and was quite a lavish spread.... I feasted that morning on Masala Dosas (In Delhi??? Strane Right! But I chose to go for it and didnt come disappointed)The room i think was a little smaller than many of the other hotels i havse stayed in but I must also admit that I was not on the top-dollar paying list.......

I was touched when one of the staff realised that I had not been able to have breakfast and packed some fruits etc for my trip!!! Now that is what I call service and seeing to the needs of your customer.I also remember that I was offered DVDs to watch in my room that were complimentary and added to the breathtaking experience!!!

taj mahal hotel ,"Great Service Great hotel. classic one. I find the rooms aren't original,and quite costly, but service, amenities, grounds, location, are all excellent. So you pay a lot, and you might find better value for money elsewhere, but it is a safe place, and anytime if i have to stay in delhi in hotel, my choice is this one, a class hotel "

taj mahal hotel ,"Taj the grand hotel in Delhi Great hotel. A classic. I find the rooms not very original,and quite pricey, but service, amenities, grounds, location, are all excellent. So you pay a lot, and you might find better value for money elsewhere, but it is a safe bet. "
taj mahal hotel ,pleasing place a comforting stay. good food and service. very strught line and fine furnishings all over the hotel. 
taj mahal hotel ,"The Club Rooms are Superb I stayed at the Taj Mahal last year when visiting Delhi for a conference. They had a good rate going for the club room so I opted to stay there instead of a regular room. The difference is huge! The club rooms are newly renovated and have a much better design aesthetic than the regular rooms. The furniture and furnishings are chic and modern, and the glass walled bathroom has motorized shutters for privacy if sharing the room. Small touches like Molton Brown toiletries also make the stay a pleasure.All round service is good as always, and restaurants are of the highest quality. It is worth paying a little more to stay here than any other 5 star hotel... "
taj mahal hotel ,"Decent Taj experience This is a mini version of the Bombay Taj but it's difficult to pull it off...seems a little bit dated to me...rooms are not as nice although Taj service is just as strong as it is everywhere else...whereas the Mumbai Taj Mahal has no competitors, this has plenty in Delhi, and The Imperial is a cut above undoubtedly "
taj mahal hotel ,"The best hotel I've EVER stayed in AMAZING! So so beautiful, the staff are outstanding, the food is the best in India, the rooms are just beautiful, the pool and spa are lovely - staff again are so hepful........it is expensive but well worth every penny.....we stayed a tthe Taj in Mubai and it wasnt hapf as good as this one. I have stayed at many hotels around the globe but this is certainly the best yet......cant wait to go back! "
taj mahal hotel ,Best luxurious hotel. It's the best decorated and luxory hotel with Taj hospitality. 
taj mahal hotel ,"World class hotel We spent 4 nights (in total) at this hotel. The first 3 nights were prior to our Golden Triangle trip and the last was after the tour had finished. Without a shadow of a doubt that this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.The security was tight but friendly and very reassuring - always with a smile. Also included in secuirty was a very large monkey, on a lead, with his handler. He was used to chase the smaller monkeys off the hotel grounds - which was amusing to watch.We had a Club room and the service was fantastic. The bulters were very attentive, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I commented on some snacks we had and a large tub was delivered to our room free of charge. You also get a complimentary transfer from the airport, which was seamless and hassle free - espically on your arrival into Dehli airport. A complimentary bottle of wine and snacks were also provided.The Varq restaurant was out of this world, with Indian cuisine at its finest. Breakfast was fantastice - recomend the Dosa Masala very tasty.The pool area was clean with no shortage of beds. The attendants here coming round with water, cold towels etc on a regular basis. What we like was that they were not afraid to challenge anyone who wore any inappropriate swimwear. There was a young guy who went into the pool in his cut off's and he was promptly told these were not swimming shorts - all with the contiuned politeness shown through out our stay.On our return for our last night, we were remembered - even by the guy who called the lift. for us who welcomed us back. The whole experience from start to finish was perfect and I would have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone. If we ever have the good fortune to visit Delhi again, this will be our definate choice of hotel. "

taj mahal hotel ,"BEST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN I got the room booked through the AMEX Platinum Travel Service. I landed in Delhi late in the night and took a taxi to the hotel. Security was tight in the entrance area and all my baggage was scanned. Check in was very smooth and friendly ,and I was upgraded to a club room. I was extremely tired, having flown nonstop from Newark. I was offered a tea as a welcome drink ,which I gladly accepted. A few minutes later a gentleman appeared with a huge tray of goodies ,including tea, hot milk,hot water,cookies and cake. I was a bit surprised and overwhelmed. The room was extremely clean and tastefully decorated. Bathroom was very nice,too. I had a shower and fell asleep. A continental breakfast was included in the AMEX plan, but I found that I had access to the full breakfast buffet which included both Indian and Western spreads of the highest quality. I stayed in the hotel for 12 days and I was very impressed withe overall quality of service. The rooms were turned over twice a day and all used tea/coffee stuff was promptly cleaned and replaced. I also had a complimentary lunch with the customer service manager at the famous House of Ming restaurant. In general, the attention given to me was sometimes overwhelming,but I never felt ignored. The only quibble I have was that the internet facility in the business centre was quite expensive, at INR 500/hr. It was particularly galling because it was hard to get internet access in the local markets without a local ID. At about USD 260/day I felt the hotel was extremely good value for money,even after considering the fact that it was an off-season rate. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Fabulous Luxury Hotel in the heart of City Taj Mahal Hotel at Mansingh Road is very close to Connaught Place, heart of Delhi city. Its a 5 star property with excellent rooms, amentities, gym, pool, spa and restaurants.I have stayed here on couple of occasions and everytime checked out with a Wow. On both the occasions, I was upgraded from a normal room to Club room, which comprises of 40&quot; LCD, personal DVD player a Bose home theatre and internet server.Its a decent hotel for business travellers, however tourists may find the cost prohibtive, my advise is to check out any ongoing offers on their website before deciding to book.

taj mahal hotel ,"Forget what it looks like this place has THE BEST service! Stayed here for 2 nights and then for our return overnight stay switched to the Imperial (a mistake). When we arrived I was very disappointed as the exterior of the hotel is being renovated and then when we went to our room I was even more disappointed - gloomy, tiny bathroom with no separate shower. It took me a few hours (during which I changed my next stay to the Imperial) to get over these cosmetics. What I can say is that having spent almost a week in India staying at this hotel, The Imperial and the Amarvilas Oberoi in Agra, that the service in this hotel was streets ahead of anywhere else and on EVERY level. The spa is fabulous - the treatments some of the best I have had anywhere in the world. A 1.5hr Abayanga massage was actually just over 2 hours by the time the &quot;extras&quot; like the steam baths, the exfoliation etc were factored in - normally these things mean the actual massage is only 1hr. A quick 30 min foot massage also had an added free neck and shoulder massage because the therapist saw me strain because my neck was stiff....end result a 50min treatment. The room was always kept perfect, every amenity used was refilled (very unusual these days) and the moulton brown toiletries lovely. The indian restaurant Varq was by far the best quality food we had anywhere....and the cocktails were amazing. Service was fantastic from the security guy who called the lift and remembered your name and floor to the guys in the coffee shop who merrily chatted with us about our day and made the best cappucinos (with little jokes on them). Appearances really can be deceving, what makes a great hotel is the details and the service and this hotel really does have that. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Charming and elegant hotel for business or pleasure This is a very nice property with great location, excellent restaurants, nice grounds and very helpful staff. Beautiful pool, a few blocks from Khan Market (try Aniohi and Fabindia for clothing and gifts) and near most things. Safe neighborhood for jogging and excellent security. Taj Club Level is very elegant with great service and nice club area. The Chinese restaurant was particulalry good. "
taj mahal hotel ,"service in every detail We have never seem service with such an eye for detail. It's an excellent hotel, the rooms are good and spacious and well equiped. The restaurants and the bars offer a wide joice with quick service. The pool and the garden are excellent and well kept. The surity is good. All the staff take personal service and attention for the guests to the higest level. You couldn't feel more welcome and appreciated, from the moment you come in till you leave the door after check out. An oasis in hectic Delhi. We will surely return. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Impeccable Service - Safe I have been to Delhi about 10 times over the past 3 years and always try to stay at the Taj. I wrote another review after an earlier stay, but think I should write another one now to let folks know all the safety precautions the hotel has put in place since the tragic incidents in Mumbai. All cars and stopped/searched before they even enter the hotel drive-around. Then all packages.suitcases etc are put through a metal detector, then you (person) walk through a metal detector... These are the same precautions that were put in place in NYC after 9/11 (I was working in NY at the time). Sadly, I heard that a number of tour groups had cancelled their trips to Delhi. I think it's important to tell folks all the precautions that hotels like the Taj have in place now.On top of the safe/secure feeling - I feel &quot;at home&quot; in the Taj. Many of the staff members remember my name. The service is impeccable! The food is impeccable! If you stay, do try the Sunday Brunch - amazing selection!!!!!!!!! "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great housekeeping service After a highly embarassing mix-up at check-in, I was downgraded from a Taj Club to a Deluxe room. Not a great experience which the Resident Manager was fortunately swift to discuss in detail the next morning.What really made this stay a comfortable one was the phantastic services provided by housekeeping. The attendant must have seen that I am using Molton Brown ammenities. Swiftly the next day, I had all hotel ammenities changed to Molton Brown (which is typically only provided in the Taj Club rooms. Wonderful, personalised service. Obviously some thinking going on!The room itself was nicely presented, good size with a sofa to relax. I did not use the internet service but the working desk was certainly of a good size with appropriate lighting.I like a good sized bathroom with a separate shower so the bathroom was not quite to my liking having to stand in the bathtub for my shower.It looks like the breakfast buffet has somewhat improved since my last stay. Service was Taj-like very very friendly.I had one interesting experience when I went to read my newspaper at the poolside. The attendant insisted that I sign a liability waiver form ... guess this is the direction that India is moving to! Hazardous activity reading the paper close to the pool, I guess. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Wonderful Customer Service This hotel has all the comforts you would expect from a 5-star, but the incredible customer service and care we received made this one of the best places I have ever stayed! We were made to feel so special, almost as though we were staying in a family home, rather than a hotel.Thank you so much Taresh, Lakshay, Albert and Bharat for taking such good care of us and making us feel so at home. "
taj mahal hotel ,Excellent service! Lovely hotel with very attentive staff. The service is excellent. The rooms are nice and comfortable but there is nothing special /different about them. The spa needs to be upgraded but again the staff there are very helpful. Varq restaurant is incredible and should not be missed. I was supposed to return to the hotel at the end of my trip but I decided to try The Imperial Hotel instead. It had nicer rooms but the sevice was nowhere near as good. 
taj mahal hotel ,"Good if you have deep pockets This place has exceptionally good service! They know you by name, no matter where you are in the hotel. Your room is kept absolutely spotless and its a real haven from the noise/pollution unique to New Delhi.However it is very expensive, and they charge you for everything! The wine list prices were out of control, as were the restaurant prices within the complex.I didn't love my stay there - its ok, but I did feel ripped off a bit regardless of the great service. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Best Service in the World Best Service in the WorldHaving had the good fortune of staying at many of the truly great hotels in the world, the service we received at the Taj Mahal in Delhi was certainly as good, if not better than anything we experienced elsewhwere.It starts when you arrive at the front door where there must be about 20 people for security, helping with your luggage (they take it from you, put it through a detecter and the next thing you know its in your room. If you booked the Taj Club with airport pickup (highly recommended especially if this is your first visit to Delhi) as soon as you exit the car you are met and escorted to your room for a quick and seamless check-in.Just entering the lobby you notice the large number of people who greet you and once there a day, they address you by name. Now here is something else that impresses me—there is always a duty manager watching over everything. In fact just before coming to Delhi we stayed at the Trump International in Chicago where anyone in management was hidden from sight.Now for a few examples of their superlative service. On a previous trip to India, a merchant in Jaipur cheated us. For a year, we tried to resolve the problem with Amex but to no avail. Amex explained that they only serve as a mediator between the customer and the merchant and because the merchant refused, we were out of luck. We explained this to the concierge and they made it their business to help get our money back. First, they made repeated calls to the merchant who became so frustrated they refused to talk to the concierge. The Taj had me contact the hotel whose guide took us to the store—the Aman-i-khas and they too began to call. When the merchant still did not acquiesce, I was told to write a strong letter to the Taj chain, the Oberoi chain and the Jaipur tourist office explaining that unless we receive our money back, the hotels etc. will blacklist the merchant. That did it and we got our money back.Another example: we were leaving the hotel and returning a few days later and wanted to leave a suitcase and a paper bag which held 2 dolls. Storing the suitcase was no problem. To solve the bag issue, they left it with reception and when we returned, it was promptly delivered to our room—they don’t know how to say no.This to me is the clincher. On our last day (we stayed for a total of 6 nights on 4 occasions) I celebrated my birthday. We got up and ordered coffee. A few minutes later the coffee arrived and a procession of others carrying a bouquet of flowers, a beautiful extravagant birthday cake and a bottle of French champagne (we enjoyed both at dinner that night.) Just about everyone at the hotel knew it was my birthday and I couldn’t walk in the lobby, visit the club or even talk on the phone without being wished a happy birthday—I am not exaggerating.In conclusion I can’t imagine better service—last year we stayed at the Imperial and the Shangri-la and there really is no comparison. It’s my pleasure to heartily recommend thr Taj Mahal in Delhi "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great service great experience Five nights in December 2008. Security was tight following the incidents in Mumbai, but the staff did everything possible to make it a pleasant experience. Perhaps too much - do they really need to have someone press elevator buttons for you? Very generous on late check-out, good laundry service, helpful front desk staff. Rooms are very nice but I agree with previous posters - could use some renovation, particularly the bathroom. Breakfast was positively the BEST hotel breakfast I've ever had - spectacular options every day. Rick's Bar in the lobby is really nice, as is spa. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Excellent! The Taj was to be our first hotel on our two week tour of Rajastan and it certainly lived up to expectations.We were collected from the airport by the friendliest driver ever, given fresh cold towels and two ice cold bottles of water...the service didnt drop throughout our stay.Great pool, great restaurants, great staff, room and bathroom a bit on the small size for the money.Go for the club floor if you can, excellent club lounge with complementary drinks and canapes each evening. Club lounge manager was excellent!All in all a perfect start to our Indian adventure... "
taj mahal hotel ,"Loved the stay We had an event in the Taj Mahal hotel this April. stayed over the hotel for 2 nights. it was an amazing experience. after the long day in the event, the hotel rooms was a delight. the food at the restaurant was a real treat. we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was difficult for us to leave the place.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in for business specially when my boss is extremely fussy! i think if he as a person found it so convenient it should be for mmost of the places. besides the banquent hall where the event was held is a great place "
taj mahal hotel ,"loved the suite i was at the taj, new delhi on 31st of may 2008 with my girlfriend .....it was like an escape from all or family and friends for a couple of days.I was just amazed to see the suite, we booked a persident suite and the ambience of the place was amazing, i just loved the beds and the interiors......the place was so romantic.me and my girlfriend had great time in there. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Truly exceptional service I have stayed at Taj Mahal New Delhi for two separate nights during a business trip. What sets the hotel apart is how the staff takes care of the guests: everyone, from bellboys and security guards to spa and check-in personnel, is always happy to help and satisfy any wish. I am an experienced traveler, but was pleasantly surprised with the sincerity of the staff`s attitude. Having said that, I have to say that generally I find the amount of attention a guest receives at Taj is excessive – I would probably prefer less attention to my persona.Hotel`s facilities are appropriate for a 5 star deluxe hotel but not exceptional. Lobby is gracefully decorated in Mughal style (with marble fountains, water basins, carpets, etc), check-in takes place at the table, rather than at the counter, i.e. one can seat during the procedure. Unusually, check-in is finished in the room, which I found convenient, because one can then immediately ask any questions about the room, etc. Overall, check-in staff is courteous and efficient.During my first stay I was placed into an ordinary king room. It was spacious and clean, most of the equipment was slightly dated, but immaculately kept. On the second stay, I have received an upgrade to the Taj Club (pleasant surprise) level and that room`s fitting were more modern (LCD TV, etc), with the décor even more opulent. Both rooms were quiet and had a view – very positive impression overall.Guests staying at Taj Club rooms have access to a lounge on the 8th floor. The lounge is very elegant, with cosy sofas in the corners. Courteous and attentive personnel serves wines (of quite good for India) and snacks in the evening.Breakfast did not live up to my expectations – I certainly expected more from a deluxe 5-star hotel. The only highlights were made-to-order omelets and warm buffet with vegetable and meat or chicken dishes that changed every day. Otherwise nothing to write home about, but still perfectly acceptable (for my European taste).Hotel has a good gym with two cross-trainers (from LifeFitness), five or six tread-mills (LifeFitness and Technogym) and quite a few weight machines (mostly Technogym). I have used the gym extensively and found it perfectly adequate and not crowded at all.Other facilities (which I did not use) include spa and outdoor swimming pool and several restaurants (including an Indian one).Hotel location is good (close to India gate), but I found this to be of little benefit since in India one has to take taxi all the time anyway.Overall, Taj Mahal is an excellent hotel for a business traveler or a well-off tourist and I found its price-quality relation is much better than that of, e.g., Hyatt Regency (at which I also stayed during the same trip). While the rates were similar (both at about EUR 370), Taj Mahal is infinitely more exclusive and superior in almost every aspect. Would definitely stay again, but only if someone else foots the bill. "
taj mahal hotel ,"exceptional service but building needs some updating We're on a whirlwhind 3 week business trip that will take us to India, Seoul and Japan and thankfully the company has put us in some wonderful properties. I am a hotel snob and when I travel for pleasure I do tons of research on properties, activities, the facilities and restaurants, and this was no different. I did my homework on this place. The things I look for most are the rooms, the gym and the food. Unfortunately, we were only here for a night and left early the next morning to go to the real Taj Mahal. Here are my impressions. The hotel is beautiful, one of the best chains there are. I guess it would be like a Ritz Carlton, but the Indian version. We checked in, and were whisked to our room to complete the process, coffee, juice and tea were delivered along with some cookies, chocolates and cakes. It was a nice welcome. Here is a detail point that bears mentioning, it will help to give you a glimpse into the hotel as a whole. The entire presentation was delivered on a large silver tray, and the coffee pot was under a white linen tea cozy as was the milk for the coffee, which was steamed, and had its own separate tea cozy. That right there spoke volumes to me. They thought that far. the room was nice, it was on the top floor and was a good size, with all the stuff it felt a bit cramped; desk, loveseat, coffee table, armoire, chest for luggage and 2 double beds. We called down for a wake up call, and were asked if we would like coffee brought up at that time, or when a more suitable time would be. We skipped it since we were heading for the gym anyways. Again,another nice touch. The gym is great. The equipment is brand new, there are tv's in the treadmills and other cardio equipment, which is cool, as well as a whole host of machines and free weights. I work out every day back home and this was a good hotel gym. There is also Morimoto restaurant and a place called Varq, which serves modern Indian cuisine, which I would have liked to try.Ok, so here is the thing about this place, its a great 4/5 star hotel, but the building is old. It needs to be modernized. It shouldn't prevent you from staying here, but they are undergoing a complete remodel apparently, and I think when that is complete, it will be spectacular. email me if you'd like more info "
taj mahal hotel ,"Fabulous hotel with unmatched staff I am generally not one for high end hotels. They tend to leave me feeling nickel and dimed (why is it in US only high end hotels charge you to get online, to park, to have breakfast?) and when on vacation I feel like my money could be better spent on experiences and dinning. The Taj Mahal in Delhi is the exception. My wife and I have stayed their twice, and I look forward to doing so again. Its not just the hotel is nice – and it is. It has a great restaurant, a nice oasis of a pool, even a good gift shop. What really sets these guys apart is the staff. Its not just that they are well trained. They have a politeness and an interest in your stay that can’t be trained – its genuine. I always feel like they view themselves not as employees, but as ambassadors for their city and country – they genuinely want to be sure you are enjoying your visit. Not cheap for sure, but if you can afford it, its money well spent. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Very nice hotel Staying for business was nice :- good breakfast and a lot of restaurant in the hotel- friendly personnel- nice and big roomDuring my stay, one of my shirt was dammaged accidentely by the laundry service, and I get a full reimbursement by the hotel on my credit card.One negative point is that the wirless connection did'nt work properly with my laptop. The personnel give me an extra WiFI card, but it was still not OK. This was annoying for me because I needed to check my business mail and it was impossible. So, please be aware! "
taj mahal hotel ,"great service I stayed here for a week and found it really excellent. The &quot;luxury room&quot; was comfortable, everything worked and was in good shape. Parts of the hotel do perhaps look a bit dated, in the sense of not being very fashionable but NOT in the sense of being worn out in any way. In any case the room itself didn't feel outmoded. I tried room service several times which was excellent - really top notch. Breakfast was pretty good but dinner in the Machan restaurant was the only real let-down in my stay - muzak way too loud and pretty awful, and the food very uninspired. There are other restaurants in the hotel which look really interesting but I didn't get to try them - a new Japanese place, a brand new &quot;gourmet Indian&quot;, and a Chinese restaurant which has apparently been one of the best in town for years.The best thing about this hotel is the excellent service. You really get the sense that they want everything to be perfect for you. If you ask for something it gets done promptly. The only slight drawback is that some members of staff push a little too hard to please you and it can get annoying.The hotel gym is fairly large and well equipped. Pool also nice.The lobby of this hotel and function rooms always seem to be buzzing as it is a favourite for local events (very classy ones) and for celebrity and political VIPs. All in all, a very good place and if you can get a good deal on a room, I'd go for it. "
taj mahal hotel ,"The Best in Delhi I can't find a better hotel than the Taj in Lutyen's Delhi. Superb location, most efficient service with a broad smile, top class eateries (newly opened Japanese restaurant must be the best in the country), well appointed rooms with spectacular views and to top them all the best club lounge in town with most efficient staff always at your service. I stayed at Taj club floor where you have 24 hours butler service. I found all the butlers to be very alert and super efficient in every way. Three cheers to the Taj, Delhi! "
taj mahal hotel ,"A super efficient hotel We stayed twice in this hotel on our arrival and departure from India, total 3 nights.It is in a high class and quiter residential area of the new city and excellently placed for easy travel to all the main sites.What impressed us was the really welcoming and efficient staff where good service is the standard.The rooms were excellently appointed and comfortable with great views over the city.The restaurants were very efficient and the cioffee shop lounge one of the best.We could not fault it and recommend it when passing through this city. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Great hotel unparalleled service I'm writing this out from my club room at the Taj -- my first stay here. The club rooms are very comfortable, although I wish the bathrooms were bigger. But the public spaces are quite tasteful and Old World (it's a 30-year-old hotel after all), with a very grand dame air as befitting one of the top 2 hotels in Delhi for VIPs. No complaints so far, and even the spa, which is the oldest of all the Taj hotels in the Delhi, is still well-maintained and well-appointed. However, what we have enjoyed so far -- so much so that we have booked our stay here on our way out of India and canceled a previous booking at another hotel -- is the unparalleled service. Everyone is friendly, professional, helpful and great to talk to -- and many remember your name or details about you. It's like a home away from home, which can be quite important to a visitor in a very foreign place like Delhi. I cannot think of any staff member I was not impressed with. This alone made our stay very memorable. And not at any time were we made to feel that anyone expected a tip from us in return! "
taj mahal hotel ,"Good business hotel but that's about it My wife and I stayed here while in New Delhi in Jan 2007. We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival, as per my AMEX. The suite was large no doubt, but the decor was stuck in the 1980s. The bathroom shower had the glass half door which i hate - water splashes everywhere. However all Taj properties use Molton Brown toiletries, which are very nice.The Taj Mansingh (which the locals call this hotel) is well known for it's Ayurvedic massages. If you are into that, you will love the dual syncronized massage.The business center is good and fully staffed at all times. Also they have tea and snacks for suite guests.Rick's Bar is actually one of the hot spots in New Delhi - serving good cocktails and cuban cigars.This hotel is geared toward businessmen. If you are in town for business, this is a good option. "
taj mahal hotel ,Exceptional service We stayed at the hotel for one night before joining a tour and the service was faultless. We booked online in advance and were contacted before we arrived to find out if we had any special requests. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the restaurant and bar were excellent. The bar is quite loud but a lot of fun! We were so impressed we booked back in for 2 nights after our tour and again the level of service lived up to our first stay. The pool is also wonderful and much nicer than the oberoi or the imperial. We ate at both these hotels as well but the service did not compare to the Taj. All I can say is that you will not be disappointed. 
taj mahal hotel ,"Great Hotel - clubs rooms We really enjoyed our 2 stays at the hotel. Pickup at the airport went well each time. It does pay to call them first to double-check though.Our first room was a small club room and not really big enough for 2 weary travellers with lots of luggage. We did appreciate the personalised check-in (with cold drinks) which is held in the room and the way we were whisked there.The club lounge made up for the small room. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and nibbles with first-rate service. There is also a PC with internet access in a seperate small private office.On our second stay the room was much larger and comfortable - still a club room so I'm not sure why.Staff at the hotel were excellant and soon sorted out any little quibbles.We had 2 great meals in the ground floor restaurant and one out by the pool. Price-wise the restaurant meals were very reasonable and good quality.The pool menu is over-priced though we really enjoyed the birds swooping down to try and steal a snack.Another very nice feature of the hotel is the spa. It's free for hotel guests and has very good staff, steam room and all the usual things. Can't recommend it more highly.In all, I'm really glad we chose this hotel. Stayed in lots of 5* through-out the world and this was up with some of our more extravagent ones. "
taj mahal hotel ,"A Really GREAT Hotel We stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel twice on our recent 3 week trip to India. The first time in a Club room, and the second in a basic room.From our friendly airport greeting (WARNING: Indira Ghandi Airport is undergoing major renovations making it even more confusing and disorganized than ever. An absolute zoo!) and throughout our stays we were treated as though we were the only guests that mattered at the hotel. Pool side rooms have grat views of the garden and pool, with ornate parliament buildings in the distance.Without exception the staff was attentive, the service flawless. Even the elevator guard addressed us by name from the first and remembered us on our return. The butler service on the Club floor was impeccable, and the Club rooms come with a separate lounge and dining area with full waiter service for evening cocktails and a memorable breakfast. In my many years of various Club floors nothing has even been close to the Taj Mahal Hotel.Our return stay in a basic room (they are slightly smaller, but just as well furnished) was no less perfect. During our first stay they had noted our preferences and made sure that the room was set up to our liking prior to our arrival.Other reviewers have complained about the price. Hotel rates in Delhi are extremely high and the Taj is very good value when compared to the competition. A little homework on their website should reveal some good special rates (the special rate for our Club room was $475 plus tax at the height of the season, and included early check-in, airport transfers, a bottle of imported wine, flowers, fruit bowl, bottled water, chocolates and that attentive butler).There really was not a single thing that we felt could have been improved... and we're not that easy to please!

The hotel is in a beautiful area in the south of the city, it is member of The Leading Hotels of the World (5 stars). Of course rooms are at top level, with some interesting ideas, typical of luxury hotels (every morning a basket of most important newspaper are in front of your rooms, with also the first two pages of internet most important newspaper of your home country), there is a large swimming pool and there are some restaurants inside. Rooms are very confortable, as well bathrooms. Breakfast is above average with international and indian food. Price of course are very high... The only thing we did not appreciate very much is that the area (the embassy area) is a sort of &quot;closed&quot; area for indian people, so you will be in a sort of &quot;gold prison&quot;, that means that if you choose this structure to be in a typical indian atmosphere, maybe it is not a good choice. In a snapshot: expensive but really beautiful. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Not so bad definitely not great. Service is good as most of the luxury properties in India. But there's no charm in this hotel. This is a business hotel for PC users. If you are a Mac user like me, you'd prefer the Imperial Hotel. (if you know what I mean...)Avoid this hotel for a while. There's a construction for a Japanese restaurant in the hotel and you smell the toxic fume at the lobby. (whatever that toxic fume was I do not know but it gave me a bad headache. Besides, Sushi in India sounds like a very bad idea to me.) "
taj mahal hotel ,"Nice hotel great service Nice hotel and would stay here again. Great service. It is not an outsandingly beautiful hotel, reception and lobby quite average for a 4-star and perhaps a bit disappointing for a 5-star and rooms bog standard but all in all we had a good stay. Good for business trip and I was taken very good care of.I have eaten in one of the restaurants (Indian) twice and on both occassions became sick. This may be a co-incidence but have avoided ever since. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Wow! Superb! We stayed here for two days to visit Delhi. We came back from Jaipur where we attended a wedding and before returning to Europe from Delhi we visited Delhi. We had a very good rate, but it was kind of tricky. Officially the room was 200 euro a person, but it turned out to be 40 euro because it was booked by a travel agent. At least that's what I understood from the information given. Maybe it was 200/room (3 people) - vs 40 euro per person (?).Anyway the hotel is like a paridise in the middle of Delhi, probably like all of the top hotels in Delhi/India are. The rooms was great, very modern, well kept, clean, ... The lobby looked like a palace, especially at night when the lit a lot of candles near a small pool.The breakfast and meals were also superb. We didn't like India that much, but we were glad we could eat some normal food over here. The hotel is in New Delhi, so if you want to go to the old part, it takes some time. But hey, with a taxi it's quite easy and not expensive at all. The only bad thing is that taxi drivers will take you to some tourist shops in stead of driving you directly to the place were you want to stay.I would certainly recommend this hotel if you can get about the same rate as us. "
taj mahal hotel ,"A Delhi Delight We stayed four nights on a Saga tour. We could not fault the hotel in any way - service impeccable, rooms very comfortable, food: the best buffet breakfast ever, lunch and dinner well up to standard with no 'Delhi Belly', grounds, pool and location excellent. Our abiding memories will be of the wonderfully friendly and helpful staff plus having Shilpa Shetty at the next table at lunch! "
taj mahal hotel ,"Lovely Taj We chose the hotel for its great location and name. The hotel provided an excellent value for our money. It is a bit older property with outstanding service. Throughout our stay we felt extremely well taken care of. Magnificent pool and ambience. Very nice spa and gym. Quality of food is not that great but the overall service, staff and a laid back vacation sort of environment made it one of our best stays in Delhi. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Beware of ""Special Offers""! I had originally booked the less expensive Taj Ambassador for a one night stay in New Delhi between transport connections. On checking in, they happily informed me that we'd been upgraded to a room in the nearby Taj Mahal at absolutely no extra cost. The first hotel was charging 130 USD per night and the Taj Mahal's rack rate is 290 USD per night, so I was pleased to accept. The room was clean, well-laid out and amply provided with the usual hotel bits and pieces. However, on check out early the next morning on the way to the airport, they tried to stick me with a huge tax bill based on the Taj Mahal's rack rate. Their excuse was that this was a &quot;special Delhi charge&quot;. I refused to pay and, fortunately, had the website printout of my original booking. Eventually, all charges were suddenly waived with no explanation offered as to exactly what was going on. I didn't eat in the hotel as it is extortionately expensive for what's on offer but there are lots of great dining options nearby - try Khan Market. The best thing was the view from our 4th floor room - right over the gardens of Delhi to Vijay Chowk and the Presidential Palace. However, not sure if that in itself would be worth forking out over 300 USD. Overall, I was very disappointed with the Taj Group during my stay in India. "
taj mahal hotel ,"5 star world in nasty New Delhi Arriving in smelly New Delhi International Airport after mid-night and in June in 38 C of heat is no joke - however, the management and staff of the Taj Mahal know exactly how to make your stay completely comfortable. Ordering a pick up from the hotel is the only way to navigate from the Airport to the hotel in comfort. Arriving you are met by a saree clad dedicated member of front desk who takes you to your room and for check-in. The hotel is really well air-conditioned and I assume the unusual sweet smell throughout the hotel is due to insect repellent - in all my stays in Taj hotels I have yet to see a mosquitoe or any other type of insect.Rooms are excellent with 7 feet wide beds, TV, work desk, sofa and wifi access (for an extra fee). The foyer and other common areas of the hotel are expansive, clean and comfortable where relaxation or small business meetings can take place. The breakfast is excellent and the fare wide ranging - and for dinner/lunch there is 24 hour dining and also a range of other restaurants to choose from.Service from staff was excellent throughout. For me there is no other place to stay in New Delhi. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Good Hotel Good Service Taj Mahal was the first stay for DOHA 2006 Tourch Relay team. It was a good hotel to start the mission with. Rooms were clean, tidy and stylish, pool was OK. however some major paint has to be done to the hotel building. other than that.. its a the stay to be if you want to go Delhi for good price. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Hotel ok food toxic I am a veteran world traveller from New York City with five decades under my belt and a long background in South Asia. I stayed at New Delhi's Taj Mahal Hotel in mid-March 07.It is a well-run hotel with excellent service. But its small, drab, tired rooms, worthy of a 1960's generic Hilton, are certainly not worth the extraordinary rates charged.I was seriously poisone by the food at their lobby restaurant on 14 March with two types of parasites that required three courses of powerful antibiotics and anti-parisitic drugs. Indian friends also told me the Delhi Taj is notorious for food poisoning. It is shocking a hotel chain of this standing and cost would serve contaminated food. Obviously, my last stay at any of the Taj Hotels. "
taj mahal hotel ,"One of the Best in New Delhi There's no such thing these days as a reasonably priced first-class hotel in New Delhi. If you budget allows, however, the Taj Mansingh, as it's known to locals, is one of the better choices. The location is great and the staff attentive. While not up to the level of service as the Oberoi properties the Taj runs a close number two in New Delhi among the big Indian chains The Club level rooms only appear to be slightly larger than the regular rooms so not sure if they are worth the extra expense. The hotel has a superior spa (one of the top three in the city in my opinion). The one area in need of improvement is the quality of the food. Machan, especially, can be hit and miss although it is packed at many hours due to lack of alternatives in the hotel or immediate area for upscale variety. Rick's is a very popular bar, especially on weekends. For a more sedate and friendly alternative try the lobby tea lounge. You can get drinks there, as well, and staff is more attentive. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Excellent arrival after trans-Atlantic flight Perfect service upon arrival being met at the airport, greeted repeatedly at the entrance and taken directly to our room without the hassle of a front desk check-in. The Indian restaurant was wonderful, the breakfast buffet sumptuous, the over-all service exceptional. ( One small exception was when we checked out prior to departure and the switchboard informed our friends that we were gone while we sat in our room waiting for them.) Having read previously about the taxes, I had no room to argue, and was prepared for this extra amount on the bill. I had not, however, confirmed the rate for picking us up at the airport ($65). Thanks to tripadvisor comments we selected this hotel and could not have been more pleased. Our friends used the beauty shop and the work-out room, also. Would recommend this hotel highly. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Excellent Service. Watch out for excess taxes. We recently spent 4 nights in a Taj Club room. The room was nice (if nothing out of the ordinary), and we couldn't have asked for better service.We arrived on New Year's Eve ready for an exciting evening at the hotel's outstanding Indian restaurant. However, I fell sick and ended up stuck in the room. The in-room dining manager went out of his way to provide my partner with an outstanding dinner that he personally served in the room. It was an extremely nice touch and cheered us both up on what could have been a very disappointing evening.The butler service in the Taj Club lounge was excellent, and the food was very good in all the restaurants.My only complaint was with the way the taxes were levied. Instead of charging 12.5% tax on the rate we were paying (which was $370 per night booked throught Five Star Alliance -- about $100 per night less that Leading Hotels had offered), the hotel charged tax on the rack rate (about $550 per night) and also charged a small tax (about $2.50 per day) on breakfast, which was included in the room rate. That added up to about $150 more in tax that I had anticipated paying.I complained vigorously to the duty manager the evening before check out. I insisted I had never seen such a practice anywhere else in the world and that I was not willing to pay the excess taxes. I had taken copies of my reservation confirmation, which showed that I would be paying 12.5% tax and made no mention of the tax being applied to the rack rate. By having the confirmation in my possession and insisting that I was not willing to pay excess tax, I eventually got the tax reduced to 12.5% on the $370 rate instead of the rack rate. They wouldn't give in on the breakfast tax, and I eventually gave up on that one. So, if you go prepared with your paperwork and remain steadfast in your refusal to pay the excess room tax, you can avoid it with a bit of a fight. It's just a shame the fight has to take place at all!But despite the tax issues, it was a fantastic place to stay and we really appreciated all of the help that the staff gave us! I would definitely go back. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Terrific property watch the luxury tax charge This hotel, located away from central Delhi in the green, government area, but still allowing easy access to desirable sites, has a lot going for it: astounding lobby with period art rotundas, big city service, elegant rooms, pleasant views, responsive staff, but the one thing you have to watch is the luxury tax charge. We booked our $ 210/night through Travelocity, which confirmation advised of a 12.5% tax. Our closing bill, however, attempted to charge 12.5% on what we were advised was a rack rate of $ 500. This was the first we learned of this! Needless to say, we refused to pay the exorbitant amount and the manager relented. Be very clear when making reservations here. The club room dining salon, the Grille Room, is pricey but a delicious alternative to weeks of delicious Indian food. The concierge is knowledgeable, without playing the commission game, and the breakfast buffet is varied, delicious and in a very pleasant setting. We would stay here again in a snap. The Mercedes to the airport is a comfortable ride. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Best service I have ever experienced I stayed for a week in October for business and my expectations were continually exceeded. Asia is known for good service but this hotel takes good service to a whole new level. I have stayed in the Peninsula Hong Kong, St Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri La and others and the service levels at this hotel were even better. We have about 4 rooms as there was a few of us travelling together and we found ourselves sharing good service stories each day.This hotel was a little more expensive than others but well worth the extra $. You certainly feel like royalty there. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Watch out for brown water My wife and I stayed in a Club Room at the Taj Mahal for 10 days in October. Like others who have commented on this hotel, we found the service and welcome to be impeccable. The Mercedes waiting for us at arrival was a treat. We have never experienced as enjoyable a check-in as we did here. The staff is attentive but unobtrusive. We tried all the restaurants and the quality is excellent at all of them. The breakfast buffet is very good indeed, although we have seen even more impressive buffets in Beijing hotels (such as China World). The waiter service at breakfast is somewhat inconsistent. The hotel could use some updating; the infrastructure is more than 20 years old, without any investment since then. The rooms are smallish for what we associate with executive-level service. We became ill for unrelated reasons, and the hotel secured a physician who promptly attended to our needs for an outrageously reasonable cost (the only bargain associated with the hotel!). What was really troubling was going for a shower, turning the water on, and watching the yellow-brown water pour out. Not a question of waiting for it to clear --- it just kept coming regardless of how long we let it run. For the premium price of a Taj hotel, this was unacceptable to us and enough to tell us we will not return, no matter how attentive the service. Hotels need to get the basics right - and rusty or dirty water is simply unacceptable. The plumber claimed the abnormally high water pressure forced the rust out of the old lead pipes. He never answered the question why the lead pipes were there in the first place. They are unacceptable by today's environmental and human health standards. "
taj mahal hotel ,"a sanctuary in the middle of delhi The Taj Mahal was a sanctuary in the middle of Delhi. The rooms are very well equipped with pleasant views over greenery. The staff are first rate. The reception staff are incredibly welcoming. The buffet breakfast is the best we have ever had. The waiting staff were friendly and efficient without beig at all intrusive. They were particularly kind to our 12 year old son. There is no touting for tips. The pool is huge, deep and peaceful. Although aimed primarily at a business market, it was excellent for teenagers. Better than the Imperial. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Cheated on Sales Tax I had the same experience as the others. They overcharged on the sales tax, nearly $100. Makes me wonder if I was cheated on other parts of the bill too. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Really loved our stay here! We stayed for seven nights, and I must say choosing a hotel in the first place was very very difficult. In the end we went solely on the opinions of Trip-Advisor members and what we were able to afford (the Australian dollar is only worth US$0.75). We found the very best rate possible off the Five Star Alliance site (thanks to another Trip Advsor member for that tip!) and booked a package that included a standard room (only differs from the deluxe room by not having a fax machine), round trip airport transfers and breckfast, for US$170 per night. Obviously for this rate we did not get a executive club room or use of the club facilities, but we did go up and visit a club room to see if we were missing out on anything.So firstly, we turned up at the airport at midnight, very very tired after a 15 hour journey, and there, bless his socks, was the Taj driver waiting for us with our name on a huge piece of cardboard. Agian, it wasn't a Merc as we went for a cheaper package, but the car was great and the driver very professional. Check-in was carried out in our room, not in the lobby, and took only a couple of minutes to complete. Overall, the room was spacious, the fixtures perhaps a little shabby and worn round the edges, but the bathroom was huge and done very nicely in a dark red/black marble, with a separate bath and shower and two fabulous shower heads. Apparently they gave us a corner or next to corner room (ie at the end of the corridor), and these have bigger bathrooms. The room facilities were very generous, with a mini room-service every evening, daily chocolates, about six complementary bottles of water every day (contrary to other member's comments about this hotel, you do NOT have to tip to get extra water - they just give it to you anyway) and four huge towels (rather than the standard three). The bed was reasonably comfortable (by Indian plank standards) and although we were on a smoking floor, there was not a hint of stale smoke in the room.The Club room that we checked out was exactly the same size, but with more modern decor and a newer touch - probably not worth the extra money, especially since our standard room bathroom was bigger (that was luck though).What really impressed us about this hotel was the absolutely excellent level of service provided by all the staff - friendly, helpful, attentive and very welcoming. The Concierge went out of his way to help us with a couple of really difficult busines requests (like sourcing three hundred bars of a special soap made in the south of India), and the elevator guy knew our floor number within a couple of days. Another excellent feature was the breckfast buffet - probably the best selection of food I've ever seen in a hotel. Overall, one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Cheated with the sales tax As a previous reviewer said - they charge the 12.5% tax on the shameless reception prices, not the actual one booked! I was extremely p---- at check-out so they decreased it a little bit but nevertheless that was way more than expected and had I not been under time pressure I would have stood my ground...I wrote a complaint to the manager later the same day (that was a month ago) but have not received an answer and I doubt I will. Does anyone have an idea how to require a refund - maybe writing to the Best Hotels of the World or the Indian tax authorities?Otherwise excellent service. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Beware of tax charges by Taj Mahal Hotel THE HOTEL HAS A TAX OF 12.5% PER NIGHT. HOWEVER, IN OUR EXPERIENCE, THEY CHARGED THE TAX ON TWICE THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUAL BILL. THUS, WHILE OUR BILL WAS approximately US $600 AND THE TAX SHOULD BE $75 (12.5%X600=75), THE HOTEL CHARGED approximately $150 in tax. When we brought the overcharge to the attention of the hotel, they said they charged the 12.50% on the amount they feel the room is worth rather than the actual amount paid. That made us feel cheated. "
taj mahal hotel ,"The Taj is one of the best hotels ever… Imagine that you have arrived in Delhi’s chaotic airport late in the middle of the night after an exhausting 10+ hour flight (and that is the way most of us from the West arrive). You are hoping that the email you sent requesting to be met by a hotel car at the airport was read and understood.As you emerge from customs, there are literally hundreds of people waving signs with people’s names on them. Amidst the mob, a man dressed all in white carrying a large (possibly the largest) sign emerges from the crowd. It says Taj Mahal Hotel on it. And your name is written in bold letters right in the middle. Relief flows over you. He takes your bags and you walk a short distance to a late model white Mercedes. He whisks you to the hotel in 30 minutes or so.You are greeted on the steps of the hotel by an enormous bearded man dressed in traditional Indian gear and a petite young woman who knows your name and is ready to take you directly to your room. The two men opening the door and the elevator operator greet you by name. As you emerge from the elevator you see a man down the hall. He greets you by name. He is your butler and he is holding a tray. On it are two glasses of fruit juice (orange and pineapple) from which you may choose. Your butler shows you around your room, which is equipped with electronic controls for everything from lights to temperature to the curtains. Your room butler arranges with the technology butler for your Internet WiFi service to be turned on. They leave to allow you to get some sleep – if you can.Around the room are a complimentary bottle of wine and several different kinds of fresh fruit. There is a plate of dried dates and apricots. A luxuriously stocked mini-bar will fill any other unmet needs.The bath is granite and decorative tile with a separate shower stall with one of the best showerheads and best water pressure of any hotel I have stayed at. There is a bowl filled with rose petals and three vases of orchids around the room. The toiletries are Molton Brown and include everything you might need from a comb to a toothbrush.Complimentary shoe shines and clothes pressing are included in the rate, as is continental style breakfast and cocktails in the evening. This is the Club Level at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Yes, it’s expensive by Indian standards. But it costs about the same as a decent hotel room in New York City and it’s so, so much nicer.The bars and restaurants in the hotel are wonderful. The staff is uniformly helpful and their mission is to please.You cannot go wrong staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Treated like royalty at the Taj From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were given special treatment at the Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi. The outer doors were opened by the traditional Raj-clad attendants, but the inner doors were opened by elegant and smiling ladies who learned our names after a day or two. The lobby is organized in a more personal manner than most such hotels, with tables with hospitality specialists rather than a large off-putting counter. Indeed, the lobby is elegant, yet cozy, with decorated inverted domes in the ceiling and Mogul style artifacts. Around the lobby area are set many tables for morning business conversations or afternoon tea. At one end is the bakery, with delicious espressos and teas as well as fabulous French pastries.We usually stay at the Imperial in Delhi, but it was booked so we decided to try the Taj. We were able to get a very good deal for a stay of five days through the Five Star Alliance website. It seems difficult to book the upper end hotels in Delhi for under $300 a night these days. The rooms were somewhat smaller than the Imperial, but very nicely appointed, with wood trim and granite in the bathrooms. Our bathroom had a nice tub and separate shower and was quite large. The rooms were also quite clean and the beds were delicious, with down comforters and cotton linens.For me, the highlight of our stay at the Taj was the breakfast buffet. The array was truly amazing - the best I have ever encountered anywhere. As vegetarians, we had quite a bit to choose from, including fruit, baked museli and yogurt cups, six varieties of bread for toast, vegetable tofu, croissants plus Indian specialties such as paranthas. We were pleased to be able to offer such an array when we invited friends to join us. The dining room was sunny and comfortable and the service excellent.Another highlight was the laundry service. Finished items were returned within 8 hours, protected in plastic, in starched linen baskets with a rose on top. The pressing service was also excellent.I communicated through email with the Taj several times before my trip and received a prompt response. Our needs, such as for non-smoking rooms, were well taken care of.The staff was quite courteous in all respects and solicitous of our needs. In one case, when we were to change into another room, they called and apprised us as to the updated situation to let us know that they were aware and working on it.I would not hesitate to recommend the Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi to other visitors. For us, it was a great place to overcome jet lag, to feel well taken care of so far from home, and to enjoy elegance and grace in the style of kings. "
taj mahal hotel ,Good Place to Stay in Delhi The hotel does not look great from outside. Just a concrete pile and even in need of a repair. But inside is better. Staff is friendly and efficient. The corridors were somewhat smelly (smell of damp?). We were with a group so there was a fixed meal and the meal standard was average. The breakfast buffet was good and generous. Rooms seem a bit outdated but comfortable enough with very wide range of amenities. 
taj mahal hotel ,Best of the best This place is lovely - the rooms have everything you could desire and are very nicely decorated and as clean as possible. The warm welcome from Staff adds a great touch and breakfast cooked to order was spot on. This place is faultless and having stayed there first time I wouldn't stay anywhere else when we are in Delhi again. 
taj mahal hotel ,"Excellent hotel and staff ! My husband and I had just spent 10 days staying in a cottage, in a forest, in the mountains of north India where there was no running water or electricity. It was a 12 hour drive to Delhi so we were really looking forward to our 2 day stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel before flying home to London. We were not disappointed! It was fab! The room was lovely - with all the usual attention to detail - robes, slippers etc. Papers in the morning, plus a summary of UK news. We did intend to go out in the evenings and explore but the hotel was such a haven away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi that we went to Rick's bar for cocktails each evening and then ate in the hotel! The hotel staff were superb and we had a personal butler! We did book a standard room but from reading the other reviews on this site, I was led to believe only the club rooms came with this service (we were not upgraded to our knowledge so this is worth checking).On the final morning we sampled the buffet breakfast where there was a vast selection of food from all continents. We did not bother to pre-book a car to the airport (very expensive) instead, the doorman got us a cab (immediate) which is a fraction of the price (around 300-350 rupees).All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. "
taj mahal hotel ,"A business hotel... not worth the reviews... not special whatsoever! For lack of other interesting places to stay in Delhi, we stayed at the Taj Mahal on the first night and the last night of our 10 day India trip in March. Our tour operator, Abercrombie &amp; Kent also raved about it. The result... a rather mild disappointment. There's no doubt this hotel is one of the best, is not the best, in Delhi. But it's a business hotel in a big city, just like in any other big cities. The entrance lobby is grand and majestic, however, the rooms are very small and blah. We also stayed in the club floor rooms, because the standard ones were sold out. The prices for these rooms were quite a bit, even by global standards. Complete rip off!! The room was tiny... no character... very boring &quot;Hilton, Sheraton&quot;-like standard hotel room. This was probably the biggest rip off in our entire India trip.The restaurant downstairs, which is supposed to be one of the best in town, was very... whatever. Restaurant service was very good, however, some of the front desk staff were very rude. One evening, we went to the newer, more modern hotel, the Park, for dinner. Granted, the Park can look like any other stylish boutique hotels you find a lot these days. We personally felt we would have been much happier at the Park rather than paying dumb price at the Taj Mahal. The restaurant was very good, too. (See our reviews for Amarvilas, Taj Mahal Delhi, Rambagh Palace, Lake Palace, Devi Garh...) "
taj mahal hotel ,"As it should be An excellent hotel, possibly one of the best I have stayed in. Attention to detail was the key that made this place stand out above everyone else. Highly recommend getting a driver for the afternoon to show you around, don't be scared if he drops you off with a mate to go and explore Old Delhi on a rickshaw....an experience I can't recommend highly enough. The rooms were comfortable, the check-in process a dream, the attentive staff pitched at exactly the right level without being intrusive. The only negative comment I have to make is that for two hours driving around delhi the price was an excellent 800rps......to pick me up from the airport an extortionate 1,700 and it's only a 20 minute drive. "
taj mahal hotel ,"Pure luxury On entering the reception to the Taj Mahal Hotel, you are confronted with spacious opulence. Marble, gleaming glass and brass, luxurious wall hangings - first impressions are excellent. The rooms are large, very comfortable and kept beautifully clean. Every night the beds are turned down and orchid heads are placed on the pillow. The restaurant is superb with a good choice of food - all excellently cooked and well served by courteous and helpful staff.My only complaint, was that on sitting around the large swimming pool, there was a distinct smell of drains and of course the noise of the traffic outside the hotel - but Indian traffic is prolific - so that was to be expected. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Sheer luxury. "

taj palace hotel ,"Better than Expected was the only avail 5 star hotel when i needed the room. was a bit skeptical having read online reviews . really hate old rooms . However the experience turned out to be much better, maybe because i got a room on the club floor , room was very new and modern. took a peak at the other floors, did look much more dated. "

taj palace hotel ,"Despite musty smell Taj Palace a delight I recently stayed for 3 nights at the Taj Palace. The welcome I received was extraordinary, and I soon learned that the exceptional level of service was consistent throughout the hotel. I stayed on the Club floor, which was outstanding. Every time I returned to the room, I found fresh towels and ice in the ice bucket. The room gadgets are handy and internet service is faster than in any other Indian hotel I've stayed in. Only negative is the musty smell, but hey, this is India and I got used to it pretty quickly. The &quot;one free outfit press per day&quot; is a convenient touch. Restaurants are great, gym is well-equipped and open 24/7, and the Club Lounge on the 7th floor is a great place to relax, read and have a drink and a snack. While not inexpensive, the Club floor at the Taj is my new &quot;spot&quot; in Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,worst hotel in new delhi india i always stay at the taj mahal but this trip there was no places so i had to stay in the taj palace and it was the worst stay i had and the worst people and there all lier's and they dont keep there word on the phone bookings for a rate of 400$ a night in a club room its really something very bad very very bad i will not ever go there and i will never recommend it for no one and who ever is reading this dont ever go there its really the worst place in all india a 4 star hotel is better then the taj palace.i hated all india from this stay and from the fights i had with them in the last day and every day.guys dont even think of staying there an advice from me to all.. 
taj palace hotel ,"Good still some scope for improvement I had stayed here with my office mates for an International conference held in the hotel itself. The location is quite near the airport just opposite the Delhi Ridge, a small forest within the city. The rooms were quite large with good views of the city from the windows. The furniture and upholstery was average and looked a bit old and outdated, same goes for the washrooms. The food was excellent and in my view the best thing about this place is its food. The staff were not different from any other 5 star hotel, always smiling and ready to help. Overall I would recommend this one. "
taj palace hotel ,"Not different to other big chain hotels I spent 3 nights in October. There was a conference held here so this was the hotel chosen for the attendants. When I enter these kind of hotels I get the feeling I am in the same place. Lobbies are the same, rooms dont have a personality, fitness clubs and pools are bigger, smaller, but ....no big differences. So what I look for here is service.In this particular case my &quot;normal&quot; room in the 4th floor was quite old and it showed. The bathroom had a very old decor and in general it looked outdated although they placed LCD and some &quot;modern&quot; things. It was a clean room, which is also comforting.The difference I saw here was the personnel. Incredibly kind, always a natural smile on their faces, always trying to help you, a positive attitude you don´t see always (frequent travellers will agree with me) in hotels.The price is quite expensive if I had to pay from my own pocket. The pool is quite big and there is a nice garden in the ground floor.Restaruants: Breakfast is a good buffet as usual, but for dinner avoid this same restaurant. Food is definetely not good there. The indian restaurant (in my opinion) is on the expensive side but the food was great. I had dinner twice there, fortunately not so spicy. I missed the opportunity of dining in the new vietnamese restaurant since it was full every single night.Fitness club, ok.Have a safe trip! "
taj palace hotel ,Love the atmosphere Hotel has very good staff with a very good atmosphere. 
taj palace hotel ,"Hotel is still in 80's but its the staff who makes the difference Taj palace hotels &quot;Earth rooms&quot; are the worst, they dont have mini fridge, although there is a mini bar without soda, softdrinks and ice. Extra bed looks very much like hospital bed. Hotel is still in its 80's where aminities are concerned. By the way Swimming pool had insects in water.Food is great in the restaurants, but they need to mention the cuisine name on menu cards of Kafe Fontana.If atall what makes Taj a memorable experience is its wonderful and well trained staff. "
taj palace hotel ,"Luxurious We stayed in one of the club rooms at the Taj Palace in 2007. We had 3 nights relaxing here before returning home after a tiring tour around Rajasthan. A wonderful greeting from the staff on arrival with a very quick booking in and escort up to our room. The staff were always very courteous and helpful.Our room had a lovely view over the pool area and was generally quite spacious with an open view over the bathroom (with optional screen in the form of an electric blind) - all very modern and quite impressive.We had a comfortable and very luxurious stay and with complimentary Molton Brown products in the bathroom I could quite happily have remained in the hotel indefinitely.The hotel itself is also equipped with a lovely outdoor pool and mini golf area. An indoor fitness centre and several wonderful restaurants. The decor is modern but luxurious in a way which reminds you that you are in such exotic surroudings, and although it is not very centrally located it is only a short trip by taxi (or rickshaw for a little more thrill-seeking!). Although less enjoyable, it is probably advisable to get transport arranged by the hotel (both safer and cheaper - as locals assume you have money to burn if you stay here be prepared to be &quot;ripped-off&quot;).The hotel otherwise - definitely worth it for a special occasion. The club room we stayed in was certainly worth the money although I'm not sure whether other rooms would match up as well. "
taj palace hotel ,"10 year Honey Moon Great Hotel, Great People, Great Service. One of the Best I have ever stayed. Beautiful hotel in a very nice place in Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,"1 star rooms for a 5 stars price had to stay there for a conference.this hotel is a joke, the prices are up to the roof and the rooms are in such a terrible state:very small, hardly any place to walk around the bed, the tv must have seen the 80's, it is so old.the bathroom tops everything:the tub was clogged, and so was the washbasin.the toilets must have been built for giants, sorry to give such graphic details but you can hardly stay in a sitting position on them because they have been designed to be so high.nothing works, we had to call several times to fix the internet connection and wait forever to get it done.and all we hear all day long: &quot;we are sorry, we are sorry&quot;there is no way that this hotel should be given 5 stars, it is a joke.the so-called fitness center is just that : so-called. "
taj palace hotel ,"Top Notch Hotel Great place to stay. We were only there for one night before we left for the airport, but it's a beautiful place. The lobby is huge, three restaurants, a bar, a mini-golf course in the back, nice pool, very safe, rooms were huge and very comfortable, staff was very friendly. I'm not sure what we paid since we booked through a private tour, but I'm assuming it was a lot... "
taj palace hotel ,"A HOTEL WITH TOP QUALITY SERVICE IN ALL AREAS My wife and I spent nearly two weeks in Delhi attending a friend's wedding, located partly at the Taj Palace and partly at The Oberoi Hotel.Despite the marbled opulence of the Oberoi, we felt that the Taj Palace possessed a warmer and more personal ambience, with a higher level of attentive and cheerful customer service.The Tea Room was an absolute delight for taking typically English afternoon tea and cakes (although the ninety two varieties of tea on offer were bafflingly large.) The Orient Express had a fantastic dinner menu served up in a most luxurious setting, although there were three other more modestly priced eating options within the hotel to suit every taste and size of pocket.The bathrooms could possibly benefit from a refurbishment/upgrade if judged at the highest level, but otherwise the rooms were spacious and well serviced.Our final transfer to the airport was potentially marred by the non arrival of an outside taxi booking, but the friendly and helpful hotel concierge not only organised a replacement vehicle literally within a minute, but also contacted the airport to put us on fast track ticketing priority such that we made our flight with a few minutes to spare. Tremendous service of the highest order. "
taj palace hotel ,Great hotel i liked my stay...overall experience was excellent...so was the staff...i think the sticking feature is the spacious hotel rooms and total area... 
taj palace hotel ,"Exquisite hotel with countless amenities and fabulous service! My husband and I were delighted with our stay at the Taj Palace Delhi. Everything from the room comfort and cleanliness to the food, from the service to the amenities and the concierge to even the medical care, exceeded our expectations. My husband got sick with a fever and upset stomach toward the end of our stay. The hotel sent a doctor to our room within an hour, who conducted a thorough check-up, made an assessment and provided us with numerous options and resources should my husband require further attention. As the doctor predicted, my husband, after hydrating and eating khichri (as recommended by the doctor), was better the following day, and we could enjoy the rest of our trip outside of the hotel room. While I wish sickness upon no one (especially while traveling) you can rest assured that in such an event you will be well taken care of at the Taj Palace Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,Loved the arrangements The Hotel has a very good ambience. The cooperativeness of the hotel staff very good. The food at the hotel is good and have quite a bit of varitety in the food. However the veg food could have been more better. 
taj palace hotel ,Comfortable Stay Nice ambience specially the green view from room.Food was excellent 
taj palace hotel ,Taj becomes an addiction It is located in the heart of the city. The hotel is well connected to the airport and all other important locations one has to go see around Delhi.If you wish to indulge in nice western cuisine...try the the Orient Express located in the hotel lobby. This restaurant features an actual dining car from the famous Orient Express train. 
taj palace hotel ,"Great Hotel Very costly for one day business trips Very great hotel, best in the class and luckily i got the mini-executive room with free wine, chocolates and the room view.But the hotel rates are very expensive during the peak period and for one day business trips it can be very costly for your company.But the best place or hotel in Delhi, no doubt.ciaoronak "
taj palace hotel ,"Late night arrivals Arrived late evening, after a long, tiring day at the Taj Palace, New Delhi. I was checked in pronto. Was also pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Club Lounge with its own concierge and club lounge where continental food is laid out each day.The club lounge also is a good location to have business discussions over nibbles or a meal, depending upon the time of day.The service, as in most Taj properties was incredible. I have now got so used to the pampering received at Taj properties in India, that I would hate to stay elsewhere. The property is brilliantly located for all of my work. It is indeed a beautiful property replete with all one could ask for, be it shopping or fitness/relaxation related faciliities. My only regret is that almost all my visits to this hotel have seen me getting into the hotel only late in the evening - just enough time to hit the sack and leave early morning. The pool is lovely and luxurious. There's someone at your beck and call for your every need whilst in the pool, including laying out titbits or a drink, if you need one.Restaurants are greatThe other facilities do not lag behind in terms of facilities. The main shortcoming is that rooms are not easy to get at short notice. However, thanks to the current slowdown, this issue stands addressed. "
taj palace hotel ,"Excellent Service I just returned from a Delhi trip last week where I stayed at the Taj Palace.I must say the service is truly excellent.Though I must share with you that the rooms on the 3rd floor still look the same (though in good condition still &amp; well maintained) as they did when I stayed there in 1990'sThey could do with renovation.The Orient Express Resturant was excellent, so was the coffee shop (which could again do with some renovation). The Masala Art - indian resturant well .. food is good, but decor needs 100% change - not at all on par with the &quot;taj standards&quot;.Got my Laundry back in 3 hours, and well done!Overall I must say value for money, but service truly excellent .. "
taj palace hotel ,"Taj Club - A wow experience !! This was the 2nd visit to the Taj Palace &amp; because i has enrolled into their program was given a Club room to stay on. As usual the check in process was a breeze with no documentation because this was my 2nd stay...the hostess came till the room to explain everything and make me comfortable.Dinner was alone in the room &amp; the room service gave me an option to go for a non veg spaghetti meal which came before the time mentioned by them &amp; it was yum!!! The meal was just right for a night meal with it not being too heavy which i dont like anyway......( most hotels dont actually look into this &amp; guess its a matter of getting to know your customers better ) Last time i had decided to take a walk next day morning but this time decided to try the gym, the manager there was at his courteous best helping with me just about everything &amp; at the end of my workout even told me to try the spa ( some of the services were complimentary ) which i unfortunately couldnt as i had to rush for work.Breakfast was elaborate with one of the best range of foods that i have come across &amp; even my friend who had joined me for the same couldnt help going on eating looking at the range.Checkout was perfect with hardly a minute to sort out all the bills.Great &amp; needless to say this will be a property which i will come back to again the next time i am in Delhi.

taj palace hotel ,LOVED THE GOOD FRAGRANCE Fantastic Accomodation For Leisure &amp; Business Both. Pools Are Marvolous. The Hotel Is Very Clean And Decor Is Simply Great. Rooms Are Cosy With Modern Gadgets To Provide A Great Time. 
taj palace hotel ,Wonderful Palace Taj Palace is a luxurious hotel with all the facilities presented in such a grand fashion. I had a wonderful experience with my family. The food was excellent and served well - The room service was perfect and was appreciated by all my guests too. I loved the beautiful ambience and the cusines. 
taj palace hotel ,"The Power Of A Bad Habit I am writing this to document the power of a bad habit and sheer inertia. You may not agree but you might sympathise. I have stayed at the Taj Palace for maybe a decade now, mostly for one and two nights.The good part is location, around 15 minutes dirve from the domestic airport, where I would award it 9/10. And that's unfortunately what I do end up paying the premium for.The good news ends there. The rooms are the most average (except the Club rooms which are a shade better) and have not been touched since perhaps 1995. The toilets, faucets, showers were installed at construction and have not been touched since. Or maybe the faucets were changed five years ago. The same goes for the carpets and the overall room upholstery.The rooms have that faint musty smell when you walk in and it stays that way for an hour or so. The air conditioners usually rattle, at least in my case on several occasions. Sometimes they rattle if turned on too high or too low. So the first half hour is spent trying to fix everything to one's requirements. Which if you arrive at 10.30 pm at night after a long day is not the most easy thing to do.There is no customer recognition to speak of. The Taj Group, I can testify in court, has the worst loyalty programme and is an apology for customer connect. No fresh fruits to greet a returning guest, not even a half-hearted attempt at recognition, nothing. To be fair, some other Taj Hotel properties do better.Obviously the problems get worse when you see what you pay and what you get. So its five-star prices and three to three and a half star feel and service. The restaurants have the similar, untouched, un renovated feel about them. The breakfast is okay, nothing to indicate anything special. And yet, I do end up staying here most of the time. Because as a business traveller, its still okay. I am waiting for a good alternative in close proximity. I am sure it will come. "
taj palace hotel ,"Excellent but overpriced like most Delhi 5* hotels Like the mid town cousin, this hotel too is over priced and around 20 mins from the centre of the city. But service is excellent if you can afford average rooms at 20000 a night. "
taj palace hotel ,Top quality hotel I was really impressed with this hotel. It's top notch: really friendly counter and restaurant staff. They seem gebuiely keen to help and not just after a tip. The hotel is very expensive (to stay and to buy food) but its quality shines through. The Indian restaurant provided the best food during our stay in India. 
taj palace hotel ,"Royalty at The Palace The Taj Palace exemplifies India's rich cultural heritage and the amazing levels of Service &amp; Guest Relations that are so typical of Taj Group of Hotels.The expansive marble lobby of Taj Palace is imposing, as are its rooms (specially on their newly renovated Club Floor). One feels Royal, the moment one enters and a stay here (like in the old Taj at Mumbai) is an experience. A must for all foreign tourists visiting India.More expensive than most other Delhi Hotels, possibly due to its grandeur or its location at Diplomatic Enclave, this one typically costs around US$400 per night for regular rooms, while the Club Floors are around US$600.The Rooms were well equipped with large LCD TV, DVD player, Internet, Bose Stereo &amp; Bose WorldSpace Radio sets. Apart from the customary welcome drink on arrival (in-suite), we were greeted with flowers, a fruit basket, cookies &amp; a bottle of Chilean Wine. The mini-bar was well stocked, as was the tea/coffee maker. The newly renovated bathrooms have modern fitments and ample toileteries. The Club Lounge was being renovated, but, we were invited to the open bar in the Verandah, where, the choicest Wines, Champagne &amp; Single Malts were liberally poured for us along with some delectable hors'de'vours. The Chef at the Coffee Shop prepared excellent Lebanese fare for us &amp; I found it very reasonably priced. The Tea House of the August Moon is a speciality Asian restaurant and famous The Orient Express is also there for continental cuisine &amp; wines.Excellent Service levels all through. The Taj lives up to expectations with her hospitality. "
taj palace hotel ,"old but still ok The hotel has the old world charm about it , but is now getting a bit creaky, while the rooms are large &amp; airy, the carpet on the floor is a bad idea.Love the LCD TV, but its installation on top of old furniture and all old furniture in the room is a bad idea.Missed the shower cabin, but location and breakfast is still great. "
taj palace hotel ,"The Coffee Shop is outstanding. Ambience and Food are superb. The Taj Palace made our 1-day stay memorable. All around, spick-and-span surroundings and a delightful environment.I was happy to see the security arrangements too, just like at airports. Baggage screening and frisking, all done efficiently. Obviously, Housekeeping and Room Service were flawless. However, the only facility i would want as a tourist is an inclusive Transport Service to and from the airport. For such a prestigious hotel, it is easy to provide. "
taj palace hotel ,"Good Business Hotel Good business hotel, located clsoe to the airport in the diplomatic enclave. Service was OK, what you would expect from a good Asian bsuiness hotel. Bathrooms are small need to be updated. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great ambience A top rated business hotel. Ideally located, away from the traffic jams. The Rooms are big and spacious. Taj hotels are known for courtesy and good food. It's really a home away from home.The Hotel facilities were more than sufficient to launch my product. The arragements were superb. Separate entrances to the halls was really helpfull. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great food When I was at taj it was great like any other 5 star.The restaurant called masala art was great.From music to food to performance.Great hospitality.Due to economic slowdown all hotels have dropped their rate,so it should be cheap now to stay. "
taj palace hotel ,The surrounding greener and garderns were nice. Pool side sitting arrangement. Taj Palace is in the midst of a beautiful greenary though man made. The hanging creepers in the pool side tables is a real treat to the eyes. Loved the hospitality of the staff. The facilities in the room were excellent. 
taj palace hotel ,Standard Taj Delhi is the only city where I think the Taj properties have serious competition from others and they just don't cut it.This is a solid business hotel but nothing about it stands out besides the usual high standards of Taj service.The other contenders in Delhi are The Imperial (amazing) and Le Meridien and Shangri-La are also better than the Taj properties. 
taj palace hotel ,"Staying at Taj becomes an expereience in itself. The great thing about this hotel is its convenient location. Easily approachable from the airport or the railway station. Very nice and wooded surroundings ... something of a rarity in N.Delhi. So itsa 5 star but somehow lacks the amenities or services a wee bit, that one would expect from such a hotel.My experience with this hotel goes way back so im not sure how much has changed since then.Room service is decent .. but could be a bit better. Food is great .. the buffets are a must try.Room decor needs a little upgradation, something a little more ostentatious. The lobby is big and just too open for comfort ... so much more could have been planned there.All in all if you were to choose between the neighbouring Maurya Sharaton and Taj Palace .... id say Maurya Sheraton is where i would prefer to stay. "
taj palace hotel ,"Good Service Taj Palace Delhi is a Hotel that I frequent. They take good care and the service is really great. I enjoy the hospitality and care they take. The rooms other than Club Class are a wee bit small , so if you like your rooms to be of decent size choose the club class. "
taj palace hotel ,"Taj Quality but poor location A nice hotel, with a good breakfast buffet, but it's located in the embassy area of Delhi, so there's nothing within walking distance of the hotel... boring! I would prefer to stay somewhere with more activity (and cheaper!) "
taj palace hotel ,"Good 4 star As with most hotels in Delhi, very high security existed. Hotel is not close to any major sites, located in the diplomatic community, about halfway between airport and central sites. However, roooms were very clean, service excellent, food (esp breakfast) superior. Our only real complaint is the street noise (horns) hearable trough the windows. "
taj palace hotel ,"great service though minor flaws grand lobby. fantastic restaurant. great service. average room amenities. hotel staff are very attentive at all time. when they make a mistake, they would proceed with the service recovery promptly. some minor flaws do happen from time to time, but i can see the management is committed to provide each guest with maximum comfort. "
taj palace hotel ,Fantastic Hotel excellent service. will definitely go back Stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel for a week with my wife and 3 kids. Perhaps one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in all my travels. The rooms were comfortable and the hotel lobby is very impressive. The Taj hotels are known for their service and this hotel is no exception. The service at the restaurants was spectacular. We had the chef stop by every day asking us if the food was good and the waiters were exceptionally attentive. 
taj palace hotel ,"Very good- and an upgrade twice! I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel as part of a tour for two nights- once at the start of my trip and once at the end. The hotel was not quite as grand as the Taj hotels in Mumbai where I live, but it was still very nice. It was very quiet when I was there and both times we were all upgraded to club rooms, which was fantastic. The rooms were very plush with great views- the only thing was that it was so high tech it took me a while to work out how to use the lights and the bath etc!! The private club breakfast room was superb, the business lounge was excellent, the room service excellent and I loved the little touches like being brought chocolate cake and straberries in the afternoon! Also, Molten Brown toiletries... lovely. The restaurant was fine but better than the food was the service- very friendly. Recommended for a stopover or business trip in Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,"Fantastic hotel This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The room was fantastic, the staff were great. The hotel is spotlessly clean. "
taj palace hotel ,"Not quite 5 star Stayed here for one night only and that was enough. Strong and overpowering smell of fragrant oil everywhere. Exterior gaudy facade design and old paintwork make it look tired and unappealing. Entrance lobby is good but elevators leading to rooms, gaudy carpets in corridors and tackily painted walls and doors require a major upgrading job and more emphasis on detail. Rooms are no more than 3.5 to 4 star level. Room entrance door and cabinet work is gloomy and need replacement. Colour coordination of furniture, floor carpet, curtains is not to my taste. Breakfast is okay but not lavish in a bright red floored dining area as if designed by team from 'Changing Rooms' TV programme.Acceptable place to stay if price was say £100 a night. "
taj palace hotel ,"Nice Hotel pretty average! We stayed at the Taj Palace for 2 nights. This was our first stop on our 11 day tour of India as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is in New Delhi and resides within a residential area. We felt very safe at the hotel, there are guards at the main gate and even security staff at the reception area. We were told that the hotel gets a lot of Government officials staying there.The lobby is lovely and looks rather impressive with a large Chandelier. The rooms were pretty average and what you would expect from the standard hotel. We felt that the room we stayed in (3rd floor) was a little tired and could do with sprucing up. I am quite allergic and sneezed a lot in our room- my sure sign of dust lurking. They did give us a bunch of red roses and also a cake to congratulate us on our wedding- which was nice.Service was good and the food in the restaurants was of a good standard- though as is the case in most Indian hotels you pay a lot for such standards.Overall pleaseant stay- not bad a a stop over hotel. "
taj palace hotel ,"i love this hotel stay and enjoy alot Room Amenities: The hotel has round 100 villa rooms in Portuguese-Goanese design all air conditioned and set in beautifully landscaped gardens. All the villas are elegantly appointed, have international direct dial facility,music, cable TV, Room service and laundry serviceDining: For the foodie there is The Banyan Tree serving Thai and Chinese cuisine; The Beach House for Continental, Indian and Goan cuisine and Caravela the bar.Hotel Facilities: Other facilities provided by the hotel includes a fitness centre, swimming pool, indoor and outdoor games, travel desk, car rental, shopping arcade, currency exchange, doctor-on-call and baby sitting. Meeting and banquet facilities are also available "
taj palace hotel ,"Nice clubrooms reason to stay here Took a club room, a very good buy. Newly renovated, beautyfull bathrooms, seperate shaower and tub, shower with rainforrest shower head. All in black marbel. Beds nice , duveets and pillows wonderfull. The butlerservice comes with the room, check in in the room, and fresh juice at arrival. The club lounge ok, free drinks and internet.The service in the italian restaurant not always that good, but as clubbenefit, you can take breakfast in the lounge. But in the restaurant the service was sometimes grumpy, sometimes very sloppy- and at times very good. The food fine. The poolarea ok, the beautysalon with good service.If we hadn't had a club room , we had no reason to come back - but its closer to the airport than some of the others.. "
taj palace hotel ,"5 star service 5 star price You get exactly what you would expect from a hotel like this. Top service, impeccable room, high prices. Must be one of the better hotels in the city.The level of service is in fact a bit over the top: someone to turn on the tap for you in the public washroom to wash your hands and hand you a fresh towel; staff do not give directions here, they take you all the way where you want to go; at receptions, you will be offered something to eat or drink about every thirty seconds, making it almost impossible to hold a conversation with anyone; everybody greets you, even the workers painting the halls, etc. After a few days, I could barely take it anymore. But I can hardly complain, I guess.Bed sheets were wonderful; the room, impeccably clean. The main Indian restaurant had great food, highly recommended. The European restaurant is where breakfast is served. Always some Indian food available for breakfast which was great. The rest of the breakfast was fine, but not extraordinary.Location is not that great. Hard to walk anywhere interesting. Taxis are cheap and readily available at any time, so that makes it easier to go somewhere.No surprise on the price either: it is expensive.My meetings where at the hotel for four days, so I did not have much choice. Not sure I would come back though if I were on my own though. I thought everything was a bit too much for my own taste. Something a little more casual might just feel a bit more real. "
taj palace hotel ,"expomania The taj palace at delhi is an exotic hotel with all the luxurious facilities one can even wonder of be it the spa, gym or swimming pool. the restaraunts offers a multi-cuisine buffet with all the delicious dishes from around the world. the attractive ambience of this place keeps you adhered to it and would surely make you stay more than you would ave expected to . "
taj palace hotel ,"Not that great really We stayed twice at the Taj Palace for two days each time in Nov 2008 . We were in the ordinary rooms on the third floor. The room was OK nothing special. The rate for this room was 19000 a night plus [ very considerable] taxes - thats expensive anywhere for what you get here.The hotel is in the middle of the diplomatic enclave and armed troops and security guards are everywhere. Its a long way from other places to go or eat. We found the service like other reviewers have a bit too attentive, it starts to get on your nerves after a while though most of the staff are very nice if a little &quot;give me a tip&quot; oriented.The food is poor not to say terrible . We tried the Indian Restaurant and it was the worst and most expensive Indian meal we had in a month in India. No pappadums for example and dry tastless biryanni.The buffet breakfast is average for this standard of hotel - no special touches as you find in other similarly priced hotels. They run out of everything [ grilled tomatoes for example] all the time and it takes forever and 10 requests before they fill the dishes back up. Best of luck if you want an egg with your breakfast - three staff stood in front of the egg chef filling in forms when I tried - it seems you have to get a member of the waiting staff to get an egg for you as you are just ignored if you stand there.We tried the same restaurant at night for a buffet meal - but where they cook the main course to order for you. As at breakfast its completely chaotic. You have no idea who is supposed to be serving you. Knives and forks are nowhere to be seen and are mostly missing from the table . Our waiter &quot;cleaned&quot; the table by giving me a used a stained place mat and ignored the crumbs and bits of food laying on the surface. He and the myriad of layers of different kinds of waiters watching were completey unfazed when I took a cloth and cleaned up the table myself.We ordered the main courses specifically to be mild. When they came they made the hottest mexican dish seem like milk shakes - they were mind blowingly spicy. The lamb dish came as straggly little bits of meat with lots of little bones in it - really truly awful food.We were offered replacement dishes when we said we could not eat the main courses. I ordered a rissotto with prawns which was microwaved to the point of explosion making the prawns like bits of car tyre and my wifes so called French onion soup was thin and small.The raita was the worst I tasted in India - there was no chutney at all for the over spicy pappadums.All in all it was very poor l food and chaotic untrained service..We had booked at the hotels flagship restaurant which is in a replica carriage of the Orient Express and so named. Its $100 a head minimum but our experience with the rest of the food over 6 meals was so bad that we cancelled the booking. The bar service is equally bizarre and annoying. There is a nice seating area outside the reception.near the pool area. We sat there and asked if they had diet tonic for the G and T's as the full fat is too sweet and full of calories. No they did not have it. OK two Bacardis and diet cokes please. Five minutes later the waiter came back to say they could not serve that drink there. He offered us whisky or brandy or wine but claimed thay were not allowed to serve a bacardi and coke there - and we would have to move indoors to the Orient Express bar to obtain that drink. We did not want to drink in the inside bars as the ac is set to Alaska levels and its freezing cold and it was a pleasant evening to be outdoors. Why on earth the waiter could not go and get us the drinks and serve them where we sat was never explained. We spoke to one of the the hotels charming hostesses who greet you or arrival about this incident but she clearly had no idea why this was and she seemingly had no influence over the hordes of differently garbed bar staff most of whom appear to do nothing at all. We went inside for our drinks. Stay somewhere else for this money. Our guides told us the Imperial has much better food. Or save money and stay at the Amber where we also stayed during this trip and which we have reviewed on here. "
taj palace hotel ,"Not a 5-star experience Stayed in a suite in a non-club floor. Room was spacious and well-appointed. Liked having a separate dressing area. The bathroom was not up to par for a luxury hotel. Although it is reasonably sized with separate tub &amp; shower, it is lacking in several areas. First, it looks incredibly dated (70's style). The water temperature was very erratic: shower took 5-10 minutes to get warm, but tub was warm instantly. THe drain pipes are too small, so the shower fills up with several inches of standing water while your wait for hot water. The toilet makes gurgling sounds after flushing. The maintenance staff agreed that the drain pipes are insufficient.Overall, service is generally attentive, but somewhat erratic. The breakfast buffet is fairly chaotic: just getting coffee is a 5-10 minute process &amp; the rest of the food is okay. Had generally good service at the front desk until checkout. The credit card company required a call (as often happens when using your card for a large charge in a developing nation). The clerk said that nothing could be done &amp; insisted that we call the credit company ourselves. Not exactly 5-star service. After some prodding he finally called the credit card company &amp; everything went through.I would probably not stay at this hotel again. Rooms are overpriced for what you get. However, I did become a convert of the Taj Group after staying at several of their palace hotels in Rajasthan. So, I would look for a smaller or newer property. "
taj palace hotel ,i love the service and presentation i and my husband returned from my husbands friend house we saw the hotel the Hotel is very magnificient and we have never experienced never before. it was so lovely to see. 
taj palace hotel ,"Overpriced.Will not stay here again. It was for a conference that we chose this hotel because special rates were available.However, we were told those rooms were full so a more expensive room was proposed although the conference organizers insisted the rooms were still available.We were promised we would be downgraded if possible!It took 4 phone calls 24 hours before arrival to reconfirm my reservation.The 800 numbers I called didn't know about my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.The emails got returned as undeliverable.I was told to call direct to the hotel with a paid phone .It wasted 45-50 minutes the night before our departure from Paris.Pickup at the airport was quick.The staff is nice and friendly.Room smelled of tobacco,looked very old with an old TV.No wired internet,wireless internet you have to pay for.It worked okay the first day but then there was no signal.Someone came to my room and tried to check my laptop settings,he couldn't really tell why the signal was unavailable or low but thought it was due to outside interference.Toilets are too high otherwise okay.Food is very expensive and the hotel is far from any alternative food outlets.Staff presence: they hover around you at every step though you don't have to tip.Its just not very comfortable.Overall the hotel might have been a five star in the past but needs some changes now.You have to pay for using the business center as well.Fitness center very ordinary.I have traveled a lot and stayed at better hotels which were less expensive.,(usually in the US or Western Europe).Overall, overpriced. Need upgrades in amenities,downgrading in 5-star status "
taj palace hotel ,"Nice hotel service too attentive We stayed on the club floor of the Taj Palace hotel. The rooms were nice and clean. We booked a hotel car from the airport and that went very smoothly. The driver was waiting for us as soon as we came out of customs. Check in was quite smooth. However, the service was too attentive. Every time I turned around, someone was hovering. I was also called multiple times (even after do not disturb light was on) to review the hotel! "
taj palace hotel ,Staff stereotypes visitors I have been staying at the Taj for a year now as a long term guest. The hotel has begun to stereotyping all female guests that come to visit. Having a girlfriend that works in a 5 star hotel she has been coming to visit for a year now. Every time she comes they treat her with a lack of dignity and respect. She is appalled at the way they treat people and said she does not understand how they still function as a five star hotel.There is a large group of people I work with that all stay at the Taj. Every one of them has had problems with the security staff. 
taj palace hotel ,"Superb Service From the start when I landed into Delhi International Airport [name of airport] to be received from the Taj Driver AND the Guest Relations Manager at 1am, that there was something special about this property and its service. We arrived in a standard car to be greeted at the door with exceptional quality service from the Guest Relations team who knew my name and also somehow worked out that I was very tired and I wanted little hassle to get to the room.I was guided to my room without any formality as it was to be taken care of in the room by my welcoming butler. I was upgraded non-the-less to the Taj Club and the service was beyond expectation.I felt royal, important and secure – the team at this property are the best I have ever experienced in all my years of travel.The room was appointed with the best quality fittings and in India where 5 star is a highly competitive arena – this Taj Property has got it right.The bed was luxurious, the mini bar reasonably priced, the food at the restaurants stunning. For a business hotel, this is the one to stay at – the room rate was around Rs. 11,000 (USD$250) a night so the value for money is certainly being served up to you as a guest.This is the only hotel to stay in New Delhi in my opinion.Pros: Service, Attentive staff, Great food, great little mini-golf course out back!Cons – None that I can think of "
taj palace hotel ,"Exceptional service at Taj makes you feel that you alone are staying in hotel Taj group hotels are excellent by local standards but north american travellers may not find these exceptional in terms of interiors of the hotel.However, it is the service at Taj Palace which makes it stand apart compared to most north american hotels.Though not like a king but the prompt service makes you feel that you are the only person staying in the hotel.Also those who love to eat, food is excellent and buffet breakfast is very unique. "
taj palace hotel ,"A bit tired The restaurant service is good, typical of most Indian establishments. Rooms and hallways are a bit tired, and in need of a major upgrade (and soon!) particularly at the price the rooms are offered. Staff courteous. "
taj palace hotel ,"My favourite hotel in Delhi This hotel is by far my favourite in Delhi. Though a little out the city, the atmosphere and rooms are superb and offer real luxury.Unfortunately, its pricing has forced it out of my budget, but if I were looking to pay that sort of price, this would be my choice. Rooms are great, restaurants welcoming and staff (as you would expect from Taj) are delightful. "
taj palace hotel ,"Reasonable Hotel I only stayed for one night at the Taj Palace on a very fleeting visit, so I can not provide a particulary indepth review. However, the only negative thing I would mention is that it is starting to look just a little bit tired...but only a little.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the room comfortable and fairly spacious. It contained the usuals you would expect to find in a superior hotel, complimentary toiletries, fruit and chocolates. It makes a good airport hotel as it is only a 15 minute drive away. Not so good if you are looking to have shops, hustle and bustle near by as the area seemed quite quiet.There is a reasonable sized outdoor swimming pool, which alas I had no time to use but it looked most inviting!This hotel won't knock you off your feet but you will have a perfectly pleasant and comfortable stay. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great hotel arrived at hotel after long flight from newark..immediately escorted to club floor, and spacious suite. room , like lobby,was beautiful, amenties included snacks on arrival, robes, free happy hour in private lounge nightly. business centre facilities and staff were great. hospitality of staff exceptionally good...we were greeted at every turn by a friendly helpful person. breakfast buffet was enormous and of good variety. hotel restaurants were first class...esp good service in chinese restaurant. overall a very very very good stay "
taj palace hotel ,Too many problems for the price The Hotel had a lot of problems for the price.1. They tried to charge for a airport pickup when I had arranged my own. I had too argue with them about this.2. Noisy renovations kept me up when I first arrived when I had a long flight and was trying to rest. Rattled the glasses on the desk.3. They couldn't fiqure out how to link two reservations and wanted me out when I was staying longer.4. The front office woke me up at 1:00am over some trival subject.Good points 1. Nice gym and workout area2. Good food at the Oreint Express 
taj palace hotel ,"one night stop over We stayed one night at the Taj palace at the start of a weeks tour. The hotel doesn't look that great from the outside - a dit dated but the lobby is quite spectacular. When we arrived the hotel was fully booked with a conference and very busy which meant the service wasn't really that great. We needed lunch and the only place we could find to sit was by the pool, we waited a very long time to get served and the order was wrong which they quickly rectified. The room was ok, we had twin beds unfortunately. not particularly spacious and the decor non-descript but it was clean, one couple on the tour stayed in a club room and that sounded much better.We ate at the indian restaurant which was excellent, the service was very good and the waiters very helpful and keen to tell us about what we were eating, we asked to share a starter and they gave us two huge portions for the price of one and a free desert when we weren't going to have one. The bhuna ghost was lovely.All in all we were a little disappointed, we had thought this was supposed to be one of the best hotels in Delhi but i wouldn't say it was 5 star, it could do with a bit of updating and the pool area wasn't that great. We were supposed to go back there at the end of the tour but instead flew to Goa from Jaipur and were quite glad we didn't have to go back. "
taj palace hotel ,"A property in decline This is the second time I've stayed at the Taj Palace, but the first time was nearly two years ago. I thought it was a low risk choice however as last time wasn't too bad, but it has definitely declined.Check InWas swift, but their computer systems were down at the time so we didn't know if I got my room choice until we got in and could &quot;smell&quot; whether it was really a non-smoking room. Fortunately it was!RatesToo high... but then, hotels in Delhi are all very expensiveRoomSmall. Mine had new carpet (could still smell the glue) and new furniture but old TV and a bed that hadn't had a new mattress since the English got the boot. Tiny bathroom. An unusual complaint is that the toilet was too high off the ground. (I know, bad visual) but this was quite uncomfortable! Cheap shower curtain meant that the bathroom floor was usually wet.&quot;Bathroom smells&quot; passed into the room from adjacent rooms. Very annoying.GymWAY TOO SMALL! About 5 or 6 treadmills (lifefitness), 1 old lifefitness elliptcal and one new one, 2 bikes. At peak times the cardio gym was completely full with people waiting. The weight machines in the weight gym were obviously purchased by a purchasing guy who was trying to save money and while they are good quality, the &quot;set&quot; is incomplete, i.e. a quadricep machine, but no hamstring machine, etc.... as if only half of the requirement was purchased. With 4 guys in the weight gym it starts feeling very crowdedFoodAverage.Breakfast in coffee shop is a quite limited buffet and I sat outside one morning and was disturbed by a strong smell of human faeces coming from the nearby drain.Room service was prompt and efficient. Food was tasty.ServiceTypical for India. A few aggressively nice women working reception and in the lobby as a greeting function and no-one else really cared. Took about 5 tries over the first 2 of 4 days to train the restaurant staff how to make a good Caffe Latte. Still, each one seemed to take 1/2 hour! As per a few of the earlier reviews, the usual was handled well, the new or challenging was hardly handled at all. Delhi is frustrating and I'm about to draw the conclusion that there are no good hotels there. The Shangri-La is the only major hotel there that I haven't tried... so it must be the only good one, as the Taj just doesn't cut it... like most of the others - especially when the rate is over $500/night. "
taj palace hotel ,"Below par I chose the Taj Palace after reading the TripAdvisor reports. Many reviews were very positive - a number critical. On balance I thought the Taj Palace would be a good choice.It wasn't - the hotel is very expensive - the rooms old and well overdue for a renovation, although there are some that have been renovated they weren't on offer to me. The rooms are average in size, the walls thin which meant that noise travelled. The food equally expensive and average. The hotel is well away from the attractions of Delhi. The service was inconsistent, ranging from above average to plain ordinary. Simple requests were well handled, anything more complex or requiring a decision was impossible. I was less than impressed with a hotel that charges top dollar by any standard and falls short on what it delivers. Intuitively there must be better choices - look elsewhere. "
taj palace hotel ,"A great disappointment A hotel that charges a premium (in a low cost country) but fails to deliver. Yes, the rooms and the public areas are what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but the attitude of the staff seemed to be how best can we separate our guests from their cash. There seemed to be no ability by staff to make decisions - everything was done by the rule book - and generally with no flexibility. Hospitality and graciousness were lacking. You left feeling &quot;used and abused&quot;.Very questionable price value. "
taj palace hotel ,"Excellent service Incredible service from everyone. The staff are immensly well trained and are extremely coutreous. The in service dining staff even make sure the food was well prepared and to your satisfaction an hour after you are served!!!The rooms are a bit tired and unless you have work in the diplomatic area, too far from most sights. The service no doubt makes up for alot though "
taj palace hotel ,"Nice hotel great service I stayed at the Taj Palace for a day in June 2007. The check in process was smooth and fast. The room was about average in size but was decently appointed, though a bit frayed at the edges. The hotel was in the process of being refurbished. I wish they did not put off the refurbishment for so long! I used the room service and found the food to be good. The restraunt in the hotel is a fine one and my guests really appreciated it too. "
taj palace hotel ,"nice hotel The Taj Palace in New Delhi is a very comfortable hotel, with a few quirks. We booked 2 club rooms for a three day stay. Our rooms were rather small, but had been freshly updated with modern decor. There's an extensive and varied breakfast buffet, and snacks in the club lounge from 4 till 8 pm. The staff is very polite and attentive, but strangely uninformed; the concierge was unable to provide us either with alternative places to eat in the area, nor with any information about local tours of Delhi. Also, there's no information in the rooms about what is included in the Club Room price, and the receptionist didn't seem to know. The quirks? There are no clocks in the rooms, though the staff did manage to find a cheap alarm clock for us to use when we asked. The bathrooms are separated from the rooms by a wall of glass. There are shades that can be lowered, but these provide only an illusion of privacy - at night, especially, everything can be seen through the shades. This may be OK for couples that aren't shy, but was rather disconcerting for our opposite-sex teenagers who were sharing a room. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great hotel Cannot fault this hotel at all. Very nice rooms and common areas and staff always polite, coureous and attentive. Staff always greet you nomatter if busy. When contacted hotel to confirm booking they had wrongdates but said it would be fixed. When we actually arrived the wrong dates were still entered however this was fixed quickly - may have been the travel agent's mistake, who know.There is a great selection of restaurants and places to hang out inside the hotel. Always a great atmosphere. Great to tourists or business travellers. Room service is to die for as it arrived in a silver trolley. The waiter, wearing white gloves, laid out the table in the room and served the food. He even offered to pour the tea and put the sugar in. Amazing attention to detail.Great location. Would definately stay there again. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great Hotel but some rooms need urgent renovation We (a family of four) stayed at this Hotel for three night in total in Dec 2007 and Jan 2008, at the beginning and the end of a trip in Rajasthan.The first two nights, we stayed on the Club Floor (floor seven) and we enjoyed nice a spacious rooms, well equipped. On Jan 02, 2008, we stayed one night on floor three, where unfortunately the good memory we had from our previous stay instantly vanished at the sight of the worn out state of the rooms. The cleanliness was good, but you could tell that these rooms were oldish and needed renovation. We were disappointed.The staff was always very helpful and warm, attending to our needs. The lobby was great and luxurious contrasting with the rooms somehow.During our first stay, we were invited to share champagne with the floor manager (Club floor) and share our comments. Breakfast was very good, but we did not try the other restaurants nested in the hotel as they were quite expensive for a family of four.The location was good too, about 20 minutes from the international airport and 10 minutes from the city centre.If we ever go back, we will make sure that we stay in one of the refurbished rooms (but surely this bears a cost). "
taj palace hotel ,"A very good business hotel I stayed here for over a week, and was overall very pleased.The room was spacious and very tastefully furnished, with plenty of complimentaryfood, mineral water, and amenities included. The spa and gym are extremely nice --one of the best I have experienced at a business hotel.There is certainly a lot of hotel service. From the hotel door to your room you will encounter a half-dozen (at least) staff who will ask you how things are, and whether anything can be improved. The staff provided me with a lot of timely help -- they brought things up to the room, made inquiries on my behalf, explained the use of appliances in the room. It is also true that sometimes their interest in helping was not matched by ability -- in a few cases, they seemed to be just reading from a script. This was particularly true in the restaurant, where staff would sometimes forget orders, or nod eagerly but misunderstand them.The number of &quot;feedback requests&quot; you get is oddly high, but I do have the impression that this hotel will continue to improve because of them.The hotel is not near any attractions -- you will require a cab to get anywhere. But I'm not sure there is a better location -- you cannot easily stroll in Delhi even if you are close enough to your destination.One of the things that may be confusing to travelers (I think it is reflected in the mixed reviews) is that although the public areasare very opulent, this is not a luxury hotel but rather more like a good business hotel (e.g. Marriott). The rooms are pleasant, but the walls between rooms can be a bit thin. Like a business hotel, they tend to overcharge for many extras (e.g. wifi, business services)-- actually, by overcharge, I mean that they charge exactly what I would pay in a business hotel in europe or the US. There is a travel desk which is really helpful with bookings -- something particularly important in India; they can solve train and air problems, book tickets, and arrange a car with driver. But they could not recommend or arrange tours or provide any useful advise on holiday issues. I have stayed in very few proper hotels in India, so I cannot say how this compares to the competition. ButI was happy to get to a place that was comfortable, run professionally, and where everything worked. The other hotel guests I met during my stay --- mostly business people -- felt the same. As long as you are not looking (or paying) for something more deluxe, this is a good choice. "
taj palace hotel ,"One of the best in the world India is both beautiful and maddening. One of the best decisions I made when travelling there was booking this hotel. The service provided by the hotel is absolutely outstanding. From the check in right in your room, a great quiet room with internet, 24 hour room service with excellent selection and good food, fitness centre, and most especially the travel desk, every aspect of this hotel is near perfect. The travel desk alone is worth its weight in gold. Air India cancelled two of my flights (careful when flying out of Delhi with all the fog in December). The rude AI agent at the airport brushed me off, so I came back to the hotel and they sorted everything out. Their rep will even meet you in the airport to help you check in at no extra cost. Pay the extra money and stay in the Taj Club: it is well worth the extra pampering.Minor quibbles are that you pay for internet and the hotel is less centrally located. Nevertheless, I would stay again without hesitation. "
taj palace hotel ,"Worst Hotel Stay for the price Having stayed in more hotels then I can count, I have to say that for the price paid to stay at the Taj in Delhi it was horrible!Service was horrid from arrival all the way till check out. The room was older then myself and not updated since. Food was average and nothing more. After traveling to the Taj Mahal with friends and kids in tow we stayed at the Trident Hilton in Agra, which was a wonderful hotel in all aspects. Great for kids, the service was wonderful, what you would expect. The Taj in Delhi on the other hand for all of us was a 2 star for the price of a 5 star..... "
taj palace hotel ,"Receptinist is NOT a Taj hotel standard I was invited to stayed at Taj Palace for four nights.The Interior of this hotel is definitely the Taj hotels standard.The Lobby is very spacious and fabulous with a lot of Indian paints on the display. Club floor room is also the Taj standard,with all the ammenities you would expect for a five star hotel.BUT the Recepetionist are NOT the Taj hotels standard. They are NOT helpful when I ask them the location of the shop to buy saree for my wife. I handed him a copy of newspaperad of a saree shop and I asked him the best way to go there.His reply was' You can take a taxi ' He did not show any intention of showing a map or asking someone eise for more information.I would not complain this sort of thing if it were not a Taj hotel. Hoping to check it soon. "
taj palace hotel ,"Stay Away Unless you Like Rats in Room Stayed there after great experience with another Taj Hotel. Stayed on the Club floor and paid over $1,000 US for two nights in a very small room. The staff was very pleasant and well meaning, but you can tell a hotel when it comes to handing problems. At 1:30 am while working on my computer, a big, fat and obviously well feed rat scurried around the floor in my room and then into the bathroom. When I called the floor desk, they were helpful in moving me but no apologies and nothing from the manager. I then e-mailed the hotel after I left, along with Taj management offices and no responses. I am sorry, but if there is one big rat on the seventh floor (where they have some sort of food facility due to the club room), then there are likely more rats. It was not only amazing to me that I paid so much for a rat infested room, but the fact that there we no apology or even acknowledgment of my issue is really telling. I can understand a hotel can have an occasional problem, but to not even respond tot he guest is not acceptable. I have stayed at great hotels all over the world and this I the first time I had to deal with a rat infested room. "
taj palace hotel ,"perfect service rooms need updating the rooms are nothing to write home about, I didn't even bother to take photos as other reviewers' photos are representative of the state of the rooms, comfortable but worn out (i.e. carpet stains, dated bathroom)but all of that aside the hotel 's service was the best of the 3 hotels I stayed at on this trip (Oberoi Agra &amp; Samode Haveli in Jaipur being the other two) the travel desk (a lovely girl called Amrita) took care of my whole trip from train tickets to car pick up (airport, agra to Jaipur with sights along the way incl fatehpur sikri), plane tickets from Jaipur to Delhi &amp; etc, everything was seamless and response was quick, she even gave me her direct line as she saw me off in the morning for my local taxi to the delhi to agra train in case anything went wrongthe check in process was also painless, was greeted the moment the car arrived in the driveway &amp; ushered to the room for a quick in room check in + welcome tea + snackslike I said the rooms were a bit on the old side but the hotel lobby itself was fine (reminded me of the Mandarin in Bangkok)would I come back again? yes, if not for the hotel then at least for the efficient help from the travel desk "
taj palace hotel ,"You want customer service? You've got it here! We stayed here for one night before heading off to Agra..and what a hotel it is.Beautiful, elegant, friendly and the customer service is second to none. When we checked in we were upgraded - for no reason, had breakfast thrown in for free - for no reason and complimentary champagne delivered in our room - for no reason! The staff were incredibly friendly and the hotel was stunning. Set in a good location, about a ten minute drive to the centre of Delhi. The grounds were neat and pretty and the pool was a good size and clean. The lobby and restaurants were of ample size and if ever we needed to stay in a hotel in Delhi again it would be this one over the Imperial, Shangrila and Oberoi any day. "
taj palace hotel ,"'Yes it's fine please stop asking for feedback all the time!' Spent a weekend here in August 2007. The hotel is absolutely fine and I'd stay here again. If you look in the dictionary under 'anonymous international five star hotel' you'll find something like this.Two things to be aware of though. The first is that the hotel is being refurbished - at the moment they are on the sixth floor, and construction is a thirteen hour a day, seven days a week job. They did mention this to me when I checked in, and with hindsight I should have moved rooms when they offered, because I was just downstairs from the drilling. Though if they knew this, why was I put there in the first place? So I'd just check on how the refurbishment is going before you book, and make sure you get a room away from the work.Also try to avoid the rooms overlooking the hotel entrance. Buses park there with engines and A/Cs running, waiting for tour groups. Indian A/Cs aren't the quietest, and they certainly disturbed my sleep, which was a shame as the hotel is in an otherwise very quiet location.Secondly, it felt like wherever I went in the hotel I was constantly asked what I thought of it. It gets difficult after a while to think of nice things to say, when you really want to say you'd much rather be left alone. They even sent me a detailed questionnaire by email afterwards to ask for even more feedback.When I got home to Mumbai, one of my friends who works in the (non-Taj) hotel where I used to live told me the Taj he used to work in had a competition with the Palace to see who could collect the most feedback. Not surprisingly he prefers his new hotel as he doesn't have to constantly pester his guests.Finally though, I would recommend the Masala Art restaurant - by far the best Indian meal I've had since moving to India. And no feedback requested either! They probably already know they're good. "
taj palace hotel ,"Excellent in all aspects Stayed for 5 days, and from the time you meet up with their Guy at the Airport Pickup, you experience the Service : which is of the highest level. The facilities both in-room and at cafe's and other venues within the hotel match the service as well. I get the feeling that the staff in all categories give the highest priority to Customer Service.They are willing to do the extra bit to make your stay comfortable.The food is also great. The only negative comment that I can make is that of the environment around it - there is no shopping opportunity within short walking distance, but on the positive site the hotel is located in the Diplomatic Enclave which makes it a safe venue. Additionally the hotel cab service (Rs. 50++ Per km, 1Hr Min Charge Rs.500) does a great job - so you can visit any place without any risk. The Drivers also speak basic English, carry cellphones etc which ensures that your drive is perfect as your stay. "
taj palace hotel ,Impeccable Service I stayed in the Taj Palace for three nights whilst in New Delhi on business. The service at this hotel is extremely good and cannot be faulted. I was offered complimentary ice cream and coffee with my meal last night and on arrival I was upgraded to a &quot;club&quot; room. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and everyone (without exception) is extremely courteous and polite. My room on the seventh floor had a very good view over the city including the india gate and the immediate area surrounding the hotel is green and pleasant. The main downsides to this hotel are that it is starting to look a little tired on the outside and the bathrooms and the spa are not 5 star quality (although at 220$ per night perhaps the rack rate reflects this). My bathroom in a club room was small and cramped and the fittings are probably at least 5 years old. Similalry the showers and toilets in the spa could do with being updated. Other things to be aware of: in Delhi a 25% tax is added to the room rate and 12.5% to all food and spa prices and 20% for alcohol so the overall experience is not as good value as you might originally anticipate; and you cannot really walk to anywhere from this hotel. 
taj palace hotel ,"They Call This Place a Palace?? The Taj Palace may have been a luxury resort....in the 1980's! This hotel is so outdated and the decorations are so antiquated that I felt I had been taken transported back to the 80's. Whoever defines this place as luxurious has not been to a five star hotel in the past ten years. This hotel is certainly not a five star hotel, especially by today's standards. Its no better than an average Hilton or Marriot in any other city. I was very disapointed by my stay at the Taj Palace because I had heard so many good things about the place, but after having stayed at several Oberoi Resorts and other hotels in Delhi, it doesn't hold a finger in comparison. The service is not outstanding. In fact during my stay they notified me that they would be doing construction on the floor above us that would begin at 9 am. We asked if we could be switched to another room but was told that they were full, doubtful. The noise from the construction was atrocious. I've been at front row rock n' roll concerts and have been able to hear more clearly than I did at 9 am in my hotel room at the Taj Palace. The woman behind the desk apologized but that did very little. The hotel should be embarassed that they would subject any guests to such conditions. This is no hotel for those in search of a luxury or even a &quot;nice&quot; hotel. However, for families and people traveling on a budget I think the hotel would certainly suffice. The bottom line was that I was highly embarassed to have suggested this hotel to the group of people I was staying with especially after I had picked so many spectacular hotels like the Oberoi in Agra. It was a mistake and I would not return. "
taj palace hotel ,"Taj Palace needs a reality check There is an indifferent and sometimes absent hotel management response to long stay customers who object to constant construction noise. The food menus rarely change, and for the most part, the food is not good value for money. "
taj palace hotel ,"Loved the Taj Palace This is an excellent hotel, the service, the food and the ambiance are all amazing. We arrived in Delhi at 3:00AM therefore, we weren't allowed into our room right away. But the night manager leveled with us and said if we pay the rate for a regular room for that night he would give us a room on the club floor for the duration of our stay, and it was definitely worth it! The only bad thing I can say about the hotel was that my sister and I were mildly electrically shocked by two different socket in our room, it wasn't too serious, but it did leave us both a little frazzled, the Manager on duty immediately sent the hotel doctor up to see us, and changed our room right away, and were were transfered into a suit. The food at this hotel is great, the breakfast is the best I have had anywhere in the world, and the service is just beyond amazing. The entertainment at dinner was also great, we had a singer named Sebastian who was really nice and had a great voice. If you have a chance, try out the spa, we had a massage and scrub done and it was fabulous. Overall, we had a great stay at the Taj Palace! "
taj palace hotel ,Pleasant Stay I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel on April 22nd while transitting through Delhi. The hotel staff were pleasant and professional as is to be expected from a 5 star property. I had booked a pick up and drop to and from the airport which was helpful. The room and bathroom were smaller than I expected but had all amenities. Bottled water and coffee maker were complimentary. I was put up on the fifth floor and although it was quiet throughout the night the noise started early in the morning and stayed through the day. When I complained it was explained that the hotel was renovating the sixth floor hence the noise. The noise was horrendous. It was load banging and I felt that the floor was going to come through. The hotel did agree to change my room for the rest of the day but as I was checking out later that day it was not worth it. The hotel itself was beautiful and the room service was excellent but the renovation really spoilt my stay. I had stayed at the Imperial last year and found that hotel to be better with more history and wonderfu artwork. If anyone is already booked at the Taj make sure you are not on the fifth floor or seventh floor. Apart from that the hotel was very good. 
taj palace hotel ,"Excellent choice This hotel is clearly one of the best in Delhi. While we were there, the hotel was hosting a conference for VIPs around the region. It was definately disconserting to be frisked upon entering the hotel and the guards with rifles on the roof, front gate and entry were distracting to say the least. However, the hotel upgraded my family to a lovely suite with a connecting room for our kids. The restaurants were first rate as was the pool and health club! We were trated very well. If I were to complain about anything, besides the armed guards, it would be that the electronic systems for lights iand showers in the rooms were way to complex! Having said that, it's a great hotel. "
taj palace hotel ,"FANTASTIC Service and Hotel -- A great last night in India My family of 6 stayed here for our last night in India. We had just come from a week trip on the Palace on Wheels and arrived at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. They were able to get us into a room at 9:30 a.m. (2 1/2 hours earlier than normal check in). We had 3 rooms and they placed us all on the same floor next to each other. We had a staff person come up for each room and show us the amenities of the room. We were extremely impressed. They even sent up complimentary cappucino and juice as a welcome gesture. The rooms were nice, not huge (like the Ambassador) but were comfortable). The service definitely made up for it.We wanted to have dinner at 6:30 since we had to leave at 3 am to catch our flight. They normally id not open that early for dinner, but made the arrangement for us to eat early. We ate at the tea house and would highly recommend it. The decor of the restauraunt is fantastice (very chinese). The food was delicious and they even brought our a complimentary cake when they found my parents were celebrating their 40th anniversary and this was our last night. They took our picture with a polaroid and even put it in a frame. The service was outstanding!As for the front desk and reception area, you could always find help. When we wanted to go shopping, one of the attendants (Rita) recommended we rent a taxi for the day (which I highly recommend). For 5 hours, she negotiated a rate for us which was 500 ruppees (about $12). She gave us pointers and was very attentive.My husband used the facilities -- pool, sauna, steam room, massage. It was a great experience for him. The massage was not too expensive, but well worth it. The locker area is separated for both men and women and there is a nice jacuzzi and steam room.Even when we left at 3 a.m. there seemed to be a full staff on duty. Overall, we LOVED this hotel and would highly recommend it. It was a bit pricey, but we thought it was well worth it. "
taj palace hotel ,"First stay in India Booked the Taj via Castle and King as part of one of their tours. Lovely hotel, room was clean, staff helpful and friendly, and food superb, particularly in the Masala art restaurant. Would definitely recommend. "
taj palace hotel ,"Very pleasant Stayed for one night on Feb 25th, 2007. Based on comments in Frommers, which did not place this hotel into their recommended list of 5-star hotels in Delhi, was prepared for a so-so experience. Instead was pleasantly surprised to find the level of service and the facilities at the hotel to be truly first class. Given the choice, would probably still rather stay at the Oberoi, but this hotel is not far behind. "
taj palace hotel ,"Long Stay - Great Experience I stayed in this hotel for nearly 2 months and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Delhi.The hotel is well staffed and has 4 restaurants, 1 bar and a lounge. It has a fairly large, well maintained swimming pool as well as gym facilities.During my stay, the hotel hosted a number of conferences and weddings, but it never seemed over-crowded or too busy.The rooms aren't massive but are big enough and the room keeping staff do a spectacular job.If you want something special, say extra water bottles each day, it is a good idea to have a chat to your room keeping staff, or if this is not possible, leave then a note with 100-200 rupees enclosed stating your request.A few of my colleagues had problems with their room bill - I didn't - so make sure you take a note of everything you charge to the room.The interent is expensive, so if you are staying for longer than a few days, make sure you ask about discounts for a wireless connection in your room for use with your laptop.The hotel is V-shaped around the swimming pool. Even numbered rooms face towards the road and entrance drive and can get the traffic noise. It's not too loud but may annoy some people. The odd numbered rooms face out onto the pool and although the view is better, they can be very noisy late into the night, when the hotel is hosting a function/wedding.If you are staying for a long time, or require additional space, ask about the availability of a corner room, which are almost double the size for the same price.The hotel uses swipe cards as access keys to the room. Make sure you get 2 and keep them away from your mobile phone, which has the ability to interfer with the magnetically stored information on the cards. Most people will have a problem with their access card during their stay, it seems never ending sometimes, but the hotel are usually pretty quick to send up someone with a new card.The hotel is in the diplomatic quarter, so at least a 15min drive from anything you might want to see or do. There is nothing within walking distance, so don't stay here if you were hoping to walk to India Gate or Old Delhi! Taxi cabs are readily available and if you can afford them, expensive hotel cars work around the clock. "
taj palace hotel ,"spring for club level! the newly renovated club level is simply to die for. as a frequent traveler, I was bowled over by the level of service at check in and check out and the renovation of a business friendly, yet fun and comfortable room on the club level. Only issue we ran into was the fact we arrived a bit late for breakfast and the staff there was not at all pleased....that was a bummer for the price we were paying, special dining area or not. other than that HIGHLY recommend. "
taj palace hotel ,"Five Star Service all the way I stayed at the Taj Palace ten years ago, and thought it was okay -- nothing special. Now I'm actually AT the Taj Palace right now and I am overwhelmed with how wonderful the service is. I am staying in a club level room, and that is well worth the upgrade. You get free breakfast where you can order anything you like, you get butler service that makes you feel like you have a personal Jeeves, you get some free laundry services, and a free shuttle to and from the airport. Also free internet in the club itself. The rooms are exquisite-- fabrics are top quality, towels are fluffy, toiletries are plentiful. I just stayed at the Shangri-La in Manila, where they were pretty stingy with sub-par toiletries, so this was welcome. Also, the toiletries are Molton Brown, which I adore. The bathroom is all marble and granite, with a huge lit make-up mirror, which I really appreciate. The room is also spacious, with a desk and two chairs, including a loveseat, coffee table, and large flat screen TV.The view from the room is also amazing, right across the swimming pool and to the park beyond.My only quibble is that closet space for two people is rather cramped, and the bathroom could be a smidge bigger. "
taj palace hotel ,"Fantastic Stayed here for almost two weeks, fantastic hotel.Service excellent.Particularly recommend the chinese restaurent, food absolutely wonderful. "
taj palace hotel ,"soulless luxury It is not easy to find a good hotel for a reasonable price in delhi. For the last two nights of our journey we chose one of the top hotels. The building is impressive spacious and the rooms are excellent, large and quiet. Five star standard perfectly. The staff is friendly and always next to you.On the other hand the hotel is far from the city center in the diplomatic area. Totally boring. The only place of interest is a cafe on the other side of the road where you can eat and drink ten times cheaper than in the hotel and meet some indian teenagers.The hotel itself is full of luxury but lacks of style and atmosphere. Cold as the marble flooring. It could be anywhere else.Our budget reservation via internet was without breakfast but unfortunately there is nothing in the surrounding where you can go for some snack in the morning. The opposite cafe opens at 10 am, so we had to smuggle some food into our room for the next morning.Funny thing, but as higher the accomodation price as more you have to pay additionally.The standard room charge is much overpriced, but you can find large discounts booking via internet. "
taj palace hotel ,"Loved the Taj Palace Right from the word go it was perfect. On arrival at Delhi international airport I was met and assisted by Taj staff who escorted me to the spankingly new Toyota. The hotel provides complimentary airport transfers to the hotel and back for those guests who stay on the Club floor. At the hotel lobby I was welcomed by Taj hostess who took me straight into my room on the 8th floor. All the rooms on this particular floor was recently renovated. You enter a different world altogether when you enter your room. It was done up quite painstakingly. It is the most modern hotel room that I have ever stayed in. Being a travel professional I have had the opportunity to visit and stay in many wonderful properties across the world. But from the standpoint of room decor, fixtures and fittings this one beats almost all. Bathroom amenities were in sync with the class of the room. The food outlets are absolutely top class whether the cuisine is Chinese (Tea House of August Moon) or Indian (Masala Art). Service was flawless throughout. All in all I had a great experience. I love the Taj Palace, the BEST in New Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great hotel great service I spent ten days at this hotel- on a business trip. It was my first trip to India and I was pleasantly surprised to be met at the airport by a car from the hotel, with a drink and hand towel to freshen up with. The hotel is in the diplomatic enclave of the city, and is well situated. The staff were extremely helpful and solicitous, and often took care of my needs before I knew I had them. The room was a standard double, but well furnished and very clean. The steward offered me fresh fruit juice to drink as he took care of the check-in details for me. There are several restaurants in the hotel, but my favourite was the Indian, which had a menu that went on for days. Again, the service was excellent. Breakfast was served buffet style in the cafe, and chefs would cook almost anything you asked for. There was western style food (bacon and eggs) as well as Indian, plus an array of cereals, fruits, juices (fresh squeezed), etc.From a business standpoint, the Business centre was well-manned and had everything necessary. It was located below the lobby, and was quiet.. The hotel also has a nice fitness centre (though I didn't use it) and a spa. I had two massages during my trip, both excellent- the Indian Traditional massage was extrememly relaxing, and the back/neck massage was just the thing after a long day in front of the computer. There is also a well stocked store in the hotel- with very nice quality shawls, jewelry, ties, books and other items you might need to take home to your family. Again, great service. There is a nice terrace outside, as well as a pool, which I did not use. I was very happy with my stay in this hotel. If I were to criticise anything, it would be the air conditioning, which I found a bit too cold. However, you can turn it off in your room in the evenings, so it was fairly comfortable in any case. That is a minor detail, though, and not enough to really complain about.Overall, the hotel is a nice, traditional large hotel that gives you a healthy dose of Indian hospitality. "
taj palace hotel ,"Its Good! Not bad at all!No, its really quite good!Reception is large, clean, modern and full of great staff, very helpful. They helped me find an obscure address in Delhi.Room was very comfortable and quiet, I had a good nights sleep here. Bathroom was also good.View out of the front was fine.Swimming pool is OK, some areas like changing area are getting a bit shabby and need a tidy up, but otherwise OK.Dinner and Breakfast was great, excellent buffet, lots of choice, good quality.Yes, I would stay here again. "
taj palace hotel ,"A real luxrious Hotel It is the best hotel i stayed in. The staff is too co-ordial and the gr8 thing about all the Taj in general is they take a personalised care about you. I went to Delhi for my competition and i was surprised that the staff also wished me before leaving for the venue. Spectacular rooms, nice srvice great ambience makes it all a wonderful experience. "
taj palace hotel ,"An oasis of calm... The Taj Palace is an oasis of calm in hectic Delhi. The staff are professional and friendly..... The Orient Express Restaurant lived up to its reputation as one of the top 50 Restaurants in the world, The food and service were excellent.The room was on the small side , but had good views over the pool.Overall a good stay... would use again when in Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,"excellent hotel for business traveller Superb care and hospitality, great attentiveness, faultless luxury transportation to and from airport, very sound restaurants and exec areas. Very inspiring and much recommended. "
taj palace hotel ,"Good Hotel but Stayed at this Hotel in mid June for two nights. It is an excellent property in an exclusive New Delhi locality. Had problems checking in, as our two-room reservation was not available due to overbooking. Were upgraded to a single suite room after some tough talk. The front desk staff need to shape up and cater to travellers needs in the unearthly check-in hours. The hospitality team more than made up for the tardy front desk staff. We were double billed for our stay, but then credit card companies will fix this.The property is great, the food is good, the location is great, but the front desk staff need to shape up. "
taj palace hotel ,"Absolutely Wonderful This was our first trip to India and having read lots of reviews about the hit &amp; miss hotels, I wanted to stay at a more upscale, reliable place. After searching the net for places and prices, I came upon an amazing rate for the Taj Palace Club level rooms, and booked it at once (about 2 weeks prior to our travel). Our reason for travelling to India entailed some stressful experiences, so I wanted the hotel to be as stress free as possible.The Taj didn't disappoint. As a club level guest, everything was first class, and absolutely perfect. We arrived at about 1:00 a.m. local time, and the staff whisked us through the checkout and to our room - down pillows and overstuffed quilt, waiting bottle of wine, fresh fruit &amp; flowers in the room, electronically controlled lighting, an electronic safe and a special breakfast/tea buffet room only for Taj Club level guests.The amenities didn't end with these room/floor features. The staff was attentive without being obnoxious. We were never asked for a tip by anyone and were never pressured about anything. All the prices were exactly as stated and there were no hidden fees. The serving staff in the buffet room addressed us by name each morning and by the end of our stay knew what we wanted as far as food &amp; drink. Service was always readily available and when we encountered a problem (of our own creation) the hotel maintenance staff was right there within 10 minutes.The food at the hotel was absolutely wonderful. We had room service twice and ate at the hotel restaurants three other evenings. The only lackluster experience was in their Chinese restaurant. The Kafe Fontana was marvelous and the room service was without compare (white glove, individualized service). The pool and gardens looked quite inviting, but as the weather stayed cool throughout our stay, we didn't get to experience any swimming.Overall, this was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. Definitely a 5-star place with all the extras (and we've stayed in many hotels throughout the world). "
taj palace hotel ,"loved this hotel We stayed at the Taj Palace after a two week long trip through the North of India. This hotel is absolutely stunning, a true 5* hotel. The pool is great. We had a club room in which they give you free water and a bottle of red and fresh fruit. The room was perfectly fine. What I must commend is the service, this was the absolute best service ever. And mind you we work for an airline and travel a lot. The staff was so attentive. They actually told us where to go shopping which was the G.K-I market and/or the central market for steel products, the former has fixed prices and the best restaurant we ate in while in Delhi. The breakfast was very good. We had some kind of indonesian salad by the pool and that wasn't worth it. We had room service which was not good. The bar is expensive because of all the taxes on alcohol, just buy a bottle in the street(around $3) and mixers and you're good to go if you're a drinker. We also ate in Zen in C.P. and that was great chinese food. We used the same taxi driver the whole time we stayed at this hotel because he was so nice and honest. Mehar Chand-you can actually ask for him I think his car # 2738. 300 Rupees for 4 hours and he would pick us up when we told him every day. This hotel is expensive, but really all hotels in Delhi are...but it is definitely worth it...we also stayed at the Intercontinental Grand...and this one blows it away really. Also, if you are concerned about the hotel not being in the center...don't even worry about it...it's not an issue there because you really are not going to walk around....you will take cabs everywhere...the city is really dirty and extremely overwhelming.I hope this helps and have a great trip! "
taj palace hotel ,"Taj - Great hotel Stayed at the Taj Palace in April of 2006. First night in India after a long 14+ hour flight. The hotel is very impressive and the staff is excellent and speak good English. We booked rooms in the Taj Club and were directed to the 7th floor for check-in. The only two complaints I can make about this hotel are 1) at 12:00 PM midnight, our rooms were not ready. After traveling 17+ hours, we were ready to sleep. Also, the bar in the hotel closes early, around 11 PM. However, you can walk next door to the ITC Sheraton, who's bar and club were great, where it's open longer.I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Booked a one day sightseeing tour through the travel desk. They were knowledgeable, friendly, and we had a great day. Rooms were nice, pool was nice, and lobby was comfortable. They even had a bottle of Italian red wine in my room as a greeting. "
taj palace hotel ,"Great Servicerooms a little glum Stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi for 3 nights on a business convention.The hotel is very impressive and service really is superb.No request is too difficult for the ever-attentive staff.Hotel is huge with a great pool,restaurants,bars,night club and a shopping mall.Room was a little on the old fashioned side in terms of decor although has all the first class amenities i.e tv,wireless internet access,safe etc.All in all a safe bet in Delhi. "
taj palace hotel ,"Expensive but.. After spending 10 nights, I can say:Ups: - the staff was very helpful and attentive. I needed some helpto clear my stuff at the customand they helped me. Generally speaking,the service has always been quick. - My room was very, very quiet. It is not a true luxury room but in the end it was OK, clean and big enough. - For people like me that cannot stand indian and spicy food, the evening buffet has always some continental food. The morning breakfast's buffet was excellent.- the bar and the business center are open 24hr a day.Downs: - at almost 300 eur. per night itis overpriced, but these are the prices in Delhi.I talked to many people and do not expect to finda five star hotel for much less.- the hotel is set in what is probably the cleanestpart of India - the diplomatic enclave - but you can'treally go out for a walk. The area is full ofdiplomatic and military buildings facing huge roadsfull of traffic. Overall I would choose the same hotel if I haveto go back. "
taj palace hotel ,"Over priced Went to stay at the hotel but was sadly let down by the price and state of the room as it was tired smelly and dirty, the staff were quite helpfull, but unable to offer better accomodation at the time and would not reduce the 280USD price, which in my opinion was excesssive, considering the state of the room "
taj palace hotel ,"Business trip I stayed at this hotel in August 2005 and received excellent service. The rooms were very clean. The hotel has a good location and was close to the airport (15-20 minutes). The mini-putt course was really neat. The onsite restaurants were excellent as well. Good buffet and superb service. Overall, a nice stay at this hotel while I was in New Delhi. "

the amber ,"Hidden Gem in New Delhi We stayed in this hotel on our last night in India. It is about 13km away from Connaught Place and there is no metro station nearby, but we knew this before booking and choose to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi for our final night. An autorickshaw from Connaught Place will cost about Rs 80 (though you'll have to go to a pre-paid booth because most drivers will try to charge you at least Rs 150). The hotel will organise a taxi to / from the airport but it is much more expensive than getting a pre-paid car (which will be about Rs 250-350) depending on the terminal.The hotel was very nice. There is a great rooftop area where you can eat and drink (the staff will go out to get beers for you at Rs 75 each) and have view of the Lotus Temple. Breakfast is buffet style in the lobby. The rooms are spacious and modern with a proper king-sized bed, feather duvets, flat screen television, and large bathroom. The only fault is that there was a slight smell of sewerage, but this came from outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi and have a quiet, relaxing night somewhere. Do your sightseeing during the day and head back to this oasis. "
the amber ,Lovely and helpful staff! We stayed in the Amber for a total of 5 nights and loved it. The people were very service oriented and helped us ease life in Delhi. Delhi is a bustling city but the hotel is an oasis. Check out the roofgarden when youre here. 
the amber ,"THE place to stay in Delhi We found The Amber on tripadvisor, when we were looking for a nice and quite place in Delhi to spend our last four days in India after travelling three weeks through Rajasthan.The Amber is located in a very silent neighbourhood but all hotspots are easy to reach within 20 minutes. The Hotel is really beautiful, a wonderful mixture between western and indian style. The beds are very comfortable and the rainshower is amazing. With really hot water, heated with solar energy. And also the ayurvedic beauty products are great!But the best at The Amber is the really friendly and helpful staff, who is making everything possible. We wanted to do a daytrip to Agra and they tried everything to arrange our traintickets for the next day. Since this didn't work they organized us a driver and guide for the Taj Mahal so that we had a wonderful trip.And last but definitely not least: the FOOD which was really amazing!! I had vegetable shahi korma for four times, because i liked it so much and the cook always made it a little bit different for me, so that i won't become boring. All the other dishes were delicious as well. I would have loved to take the cook home with me ;-)So whenever you come to Delhi you should stay at The Amber. It is definitely in one league with all the big names in Delhi, but it is way more friendly and reasonable in price. "
the amber ,"Why is there so much hype about this place? The place doesn't measure up to the rave reviews it seems to get. It is far from the airport. Interiors of rooms are fine, but the window is so small as to make it feel like sleeping in a basement. Service, quality of amenities just doesn't quite make the grade of a 'great' hotel. "
the amber ,"A Quiet Oasis in Delhi Amber is one of a kind in Delhi. Quiet, contemporary, comfortable, clean. It excels in all areas. Mukesh the manager and all of the staff are very friendly and make you feel right at home. There have been very few hotels anywhere that I have actually sat down in the lobby and engaged in conversation. The room decor is very modern and the bathrooms are spacious with all the up-to-date amenities that you expect. Food is very good and there is a nice rooftop garden with a great view of the Lotus Temple at sunset. I stayed in two different rooms on front and back ends of a trip to Kathmandu and both visits were equally impressive. The staff were very flexible in accommodating my 3 and 4 o'clock early morning wakeups for the airport. Its location in a residential neighborhood is both a pro and a con -- great respite from the constant honking horns of Delhi's traffic, but also hard for drivers to find. Prices are very reasonable compared to the &quot;big name&quot; hotels in Delhi and you will get equal or better service. I would definitely stay here again. "
the amber ,"A warm and welcoming refuge from the city...and a beautifully appointed hotel The amber was an absolutely beautiful place for us to stay upon our arrival in Delhi. The hotel was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The beds were firm and the bedding was very tasteful, as was the furniture in the room. (Note: The showers are fantastic! Great water pressure.) Mukesh, the general manager, and his staff could not have been more welcoming. They made us feel right at home...even when we arrived at midnight! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Delhi. The only negative was that we couldn't stay longer! "
the amber ,"Amazing Customer Service!!! I stayed at the Amber for only a 3 nights, but wished I would have stayed there much longer. The hotel was immaculate, very modern and very well appointed, but more than anything, the customer service was incredible. I forgot my hair brush and the staff actually went out for me and bought me one at 11pm at night. On two mornings, I also had to leave at 5:30am and they were able to accomodate me for breakfast and even sent me along with some Indian specialties for later in the day. The owner and managers are very good and highly responsive to any requests you might have. The only downside for me was lack of hot water on 2 of the days I was there, but I came to find that very hot water in India is rare even when staying at the best hotels. All in all, I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone. "
the amber ,"Saris and Parties with the Boss After spending just over a week in the deepest sub-incontinent living in villages, traipsing through farms and battling 6-inch cobras, I needed a quiet and hassle free place to stay in Delhi as I caught up with friends, reviewed footage for a documentary I'm making, and chilled out. Indian hospitality is where the guest is king. This seems to be The Amber's motto.I arrived in Delhi via the domestic terminal...the Amber only offers transfers from the International terminal. They suggested the best way is to take advantage of the pre-paid taxi rank (approx 230 rupees to Sukhdev Vihar compared to over 1000 if the hotel arrange it for you). The rooms were very clean, but the windows don't open. The roof terrace is nice but there is no gym. The food was good...tho rather expensive for India/Delhi if you're into the 60 rupees for a chicken biryani schtick.Now...the service. I acquired some sari fabric on my shoot. I casually asked the people at the desk where I could get a top and a petticoat for it. They not only took me to a tailor at a local market to get measured up, but collected the gear and gave me an adhoc sari wrapping lesson. I was having lunch when the boss wandered over and introduced himself. By the conversation's end, I was his guest to one of his friends' pre-wedding parties. Everything I could've possibly wanted was catered for. The only issue I had was that no taxi driver or tuk tuk man knows where this place is. I'd suggest a little map printed on their calling card to help guests out.The boss said he's up against hotels like the Metropolitan. In terms of size and facilities, they can't compare. So where they have to excel is in service. The rooms are well-appointed, the rain showers are amazing. And its one of the few hotels in Delhi to have an environmental commitment to solar energy and reusing rainwater. Having stayed in many hotels around the world...mostly boutique ones...The Amber is, so far, the best. So if you can afford it and you don't really want the impersonal service you get with the bigger chains, come here. Stay. "
the amber ,"Excellent clean hotel in quiet location with rooftop terrace and great staff This was our second stay in Delhi within a fortnight and in comparison with Old Delhi where we first stayed the Amber was a breath of fresh air (literally)!. The hotel is situated in a quiet location which is mostly residential, so not really an area with lots of amenities on its doorstep, but with thousands of autorickshaws in Delhi this is not a problem. The hotel is immaculately clean, all white marble and over 3 floors with a fantastic roof top terrace with grass and rattan furniture, making it the ideal place to relax in the evening with a meal and view across of the city.The staff are all excellent. You receive an exceptionally warm welcome when you arrive and are all helpful throughout your stay. We were even allowed a late checkout to fit in around our flight times meaning that we could get the most out of our last day in India. The restaurant is situated on the ground floor near the lobby, so not the most relaxing of spaces however you can take meals on the roof which we would certainly recommend. The menu is varied with Indian, Chinese and Western food. The food is of very good quality, good sized portions and reasonably priced. The complimentary breakfast is adequate (but have to admit we did not get up very early so did not benefit from it as much as we perhaps could). The waiting staff are all excellent. What is particularly nice at this hotel is that the staff are happy to engage in conservation, something that we found is not so forthcoming in the larger hotels in India, this gave a much more personal feel to the place.The room was very clean, nicely decorated and the beds were extremely comfortable. Whilst the rooms do have windows ours was frosted glass, so do not expect to get a view, but you do get natural light , and the roof terrace more than makes up for this. The bathroom was very good, nice large walk in shower and again all marble. Certainly clean.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a quieter and cleaner location in the city. "
the amber ,Experience beyond expectations Amber is located in the east side of Delhi in a quiet neighborhood that depicts the normal day to day life of India through its large window in each room. This is a medium rate boutique hotel where the rooms were at a standard of any high end European or American hotel. The room was clean and the interior was tastefully done where each furniture item was selected with thought and a theme in mind. The bathroom was exceptionally good. Rooms carried all state of the art equipments. I must comment specifically on the food from the Amber kitchen. It was better than all the locations we were recommended to eat during our one week stay in Delhi. We did try all locations and always ended up coming back to Amber to taste items from their menu. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We felt at home at Amber - a special home with room service :-) I would recommend this to anyone and I would definitely return. 
the amber ,"Wonderful Experience I recently spent 10 days at the Amber hotel and found it to be a pleasant surprise. I have been traveling to India for the last 14 years and have stayed at many hotels in Delhi and found the Amber to be up there with the best. The rooms are large, clean and elegant. The bathrooms were of the highest standard, with a wonderful shower to refresh your self at the end of a busy day. I stayed in room 301 and found the view delightful as an array of colourful saris wandering down road in the early mornings and evenings. The staff at the Amber are wonderful, they are warm and helpful. It was always a pleasure to arrive at breakfast to a friendly smile and efficient service. The food was amazing, because it is a boutique hotel they cook your meals from scratch and you do not get food that has been pre prepared. Sitting on the roof top and eating the delicious food was a nice touch as the Diwali fireworks went off around us. As for the location it was good for us. It got us out of the chaos of the busy Delhi streets. Close by there are some great restaurants if you feel like going out for your evening meal. It is very close to Nehru place and South Extension to do some shopping. I would recommend that you have clear instructions as to how to get to the hotel so you can tell the taxi drivers. Once you know where you are it is not that hard to find. Ask the staff at reception and they will write it all down for you. The hotel has great Wi-Fi service that never failed. A few more little touches of India would not go astray. The staff are dressed to western formal for my liking, but this is the only negative thing I can think to say about this hotel. Looking forward to staying again in the near future. "
the amber ,"Home from home I stayed at the Amber again this time, which would be my 4th stay here. It is by far the best value 5 star hotel in Delhi. The staff are friendly and helpful and always remember you on your return. The room service has greatly improved and is now as good as anny hotel with a much wider menu. The best new addition is the sun terrace which is a great place to chill out. Will be staying here again next year! "
the amber ,"stylish and comfortable in Delhi The room was excellent - very modern and well appointed. Great bathroom. Service is immaculate and very friendly. Its also in a relatively quiet location - which is very welcome in Delhi. This is obviously not in any way a heritage hotel, but for anyone new to India or just wanting a very comfortable and welcoming start to a trip, its a great stay. "
the amber ,"STAYED AT THE AMBER AGAIN I stayed at the Amber Hotel again on my trip to Delhi and this hotel is the really really good. The people working there remembered me and were warm as ever. The hotel is extremely clean and I would reccommend it to any traveller looking for 5 star accomadation at a affordable price. Food, service and accomadation is top notch. Check out their website for an accurate description. Stay at Amber and you can thank me later. "
the amber ,"Refreshing new take on a business hotel. I stayed at The Amber from 20 August 2009 to the 26th. I arrived at 2:30 AM at the Delhi airport yet I had a driver from The Amber awaiting my arrival. Multiple hotel staff enthusiastically greeted me despite the late time. My room was immaculate and very comfortable. I particularly liked the bathroom, which was huge and stylish (massive rainfall shower head, bowl sink, liberal use of marble). My bed was comfortable and the room was quiet (the hotel is not located on one Delhi's manic roads, but in a more quieter neighborhood that is around the corner from the chaos). I thought the room service and staff was overly generous and the staff were very helpful in helping me plan my time in Delhi. I used their helpful laundry service, which had quick turnover. I would stay here again and I highly recommend this place. This hidden gem is a great value! "
the amber ,"Fisrt class service - excellent hotel. We stayed at the Amber for our first few nights in Delhi. The rooms were even better than those shown on the website. The staff were incredibly helpul and genuinely went out of their ways to ensure we had a happy and comfortable stay. The location is about a 15 minute taxi ride out of central Delhi at a cost of about 200rupees. It was actually refreshing to be away from the noise and hustle of Delhi in the evenings as the hotel is located in New Friends Colony which is itself home to many great restaurants and bars. The hotel staff were brilliant, rooms very clean and modern, great AC and showers. All in all a great base from which to explore Delhi. "
the amber ,"I wish we wwere staying longer an excellent choice and hotel!!! Deciding on where to stay as new travellers and in a new country/ hectic city was a difficult decision however, we are thrilled we chose The Amber. The staff are friendly and will always go the extra mile to help and advise. The hotel features beautiful interiors and makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive at the front door and are greeted by Mukesh and his wonderful team.The rooms are beautiful, the showers are incredible and our overall stay has been a fantastic start to our trip. After reading several comments made by other guests, we were somewhat concerned over the hotels location however the staff go the extra mile to helping, with booking taxi's and even taking us themselves to the local town( which boasts wonderful resturants). This was perfect for 2 single females who have never travelled to India. I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone and would not be put off by the peaceful location. It is not far from the main attractions and is worth travelling that little bit further out to relax at the end of a hectic day.An excellent hotel overall!!! "
the amber ,Love It!! :) Gorgeous and peaceful!! that too in the heart of Delhi.Great Service and very friendly- ever helpful staff!!The rooms are lovely and extreamly comfortable!MUST TRY FOR ALL!! :) 
the amber ,A great hotel with very friendly service A great modern and clean hotel (unusual in India as many hotels are quite dirty). In a quiet area of Delhi within access of amenites by short taxi journey. Staff are very friendly and willing to offer lots of help. Roomes are very modern with lovely bathroom facilities.Internet connection is free and is high speed which is great if you are a business traveller and the flat screen tv with English channels is great! 
the amber ,"Great Hotel Not the typical and not for Delhi Wonderful hotel. New and modern, thoughtfully designed and appointed. Excellent service; from the hotel front desk staff, reservations, restaurant, to car service. We stayed here twice over a month, each stay was great and consistent.ly excellent. The restaurant is exceptional and of good value, Indian to Continential, Italian and Chinese. Would stay here again and recommend to friends. "
the amber ,"A safe haven in a chaotic city Excellent hotel in south-east Delhi - located in a quiet residential area which made you really feel like you had escaped the chaos each evening (which is much needed believe me!)! The staff were unbelieveably friendly and helpful - ordering taxis, tours, restaurant bookings, train tickets.....you name, they would do it for you!! The security staff even helped us with a taxi-driver who had totally ripped us off...we managed to negotiate the price together after the drive back!! Quite a new hotel with beautifully furnished and clean rooms - fantastic room service and whilst breakfast menu was quite sparse, the food and service again was excellent!Would definitely recommended as a safe and peaceful base whilst exploring Delhi! "
the amber ,"Nice hotel but the location ... Clean, well modernised hotel, helpful staff but, alas, miles from anywhere in fairly unsalubrious surroundings. "
the amber ,"Brand hotel - lovely rooms Brand new hotel with all the mod-cons of a big city hotel.Excellent service, but lacked ambience or atmosphere, i think there was only one other person staying at the time.Food was great, room was lovely and a welcome break from the budget accomodation we had been staying in up until now. The staff were extremely helpful and very accomodating.Would say that it was well off the beaten track and was a long drive from most things so not a good location if you are wanting to get out and see lots of sights. "
the amber ,"Lovely small hotel in the upper end of Delhi hotels. We stayed in three different hotels during our visits to Delhi and we liked The Amber. It's a small but very welcoming and friendly hotel in one of the quiter suburbs of south Delhi away from the hustle of CP.The breakfasts were good and included in the price of £125 per night per room. The staff were very helpful and the room was beautiful. The only issue was that none of the taxi drivers seemed to be able to find it, although to be fair, this was the case with a lot of hotels and sites in Delhi! It is out of the way, but close to The Lotus Temple and south Delhi restaurants. "
the amber ,"Nice room terrible location We stayed at the Amber on our last night in India before flying home.The location is a long way out from anywhere. We wanted to do some last minute shopping. Unfortunately this is in completely the wrong area, It is about half an hour if the roads are good! to get into the centre of New Dehli. We were also disappointed that the hotel did not have any alcohol as we would dearly have liked a drink after a very hot day sightseeing. On the other hand the room itself was lovely. It was spacious and well presented. The breakfast was adequate but no more.All in all room great, location bad and quite expensive. "
the amber ,"A great small hotel We were passing thru Delhi so we just wanted a comfortable, clean hotel for one night. Our travel agent had offered two options but we did not care for either. After checking the hotels on Trip Advisor, we opted for this boutique hotel based on the reviews. We found it to be a very nice and contemporary with a great bathroom, comfortable bed and bedding and great staff. "
the amber ,"A PLACE TO STAY IN DELHI We stayed at this relatively new modern style hotel as part of a wonderful 17 day private tour organised by Mr V P Singh of the Indian based company 'Legends and Palaces '. The bedrooms and bathrooms were delightful and 5 star quality. The service is almost too attentive. Be careful with dinner as VAT &amp; Service is added to the bill. That said, the meals we had were good and tasty. Note, the lounge is part of the dining area and entrance hall. Despite these criticisms, the hotel is in a quiet, leafy sides street and is good value for money for Delhi. "
the amber ,"Perfect hotel for stay in Delhi After many hours of research on the web, especially on the Tripadvisor site, we decided to book our 2 night stay in Delhi at the Amber Hotel and we were not disappointed.The hotel was in a quite residential location as well as being close 15-20 minutes to shopping areas, the room was spacious, big window, large flat screen T.V , and white crispy bed sheets clean &amp; the bathroom with seprate thick glass shower area with rain shower on top , the staff well trained and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. On arrival there was a welcome drink offered, however the receptionist take us to the room and informed about the facilities. We dined in the restaurants at the lobby level and found the food to be high standard and reasonably priced. All in all a fabulous stay and we will certainly be back. "
the amber ,"Quality hotel Good hotel, rooms are wonderful, great staff, BUT! breakfast is very average and basic, that needs to be addressed, also it has not got got a bar, and that was a BIG let down, and we were told we couldn't bring our own drinks down from our rooms. but the hotel itself is very clean, and we would go back, "
the amber ,"Wonderful-looking hotel great people I stayed here for 3 nights with my 18-yr-old son and we really loved this hotel. We even extended our stay there a night. Delhi is a typical Indian big city - dirty, noisy, seemingly incomprehensible. The Amber provides an impeccably clean, beautiful, calm, quiet island in the storm. The staff could not have been more helpful. Breakfast was good too. It's definitely worth it to have the hotel send a driver to pick you up from the airport. Also FYI, there are two Amber hotels in Delhi and one of them is in a bad location so make sure you take down the info for the right one. "
the amber ,"Excellent hotel but overpriced The Amber is off the beaten path and you would need your own transportation. An excellent, clean and very modern hotel run by a friendly staff who is eager to help. The price for a room is comparable to five star hotels in Delhi. The Amber provides a clean modern place in a nice neighborhood. I would get into a larger five star hotel that has the infrastructure for rental cars, tours and an enviornment to meet other tourists. The hotel does have access to rental cars but we got a car for less than half of what it would have cost us to get it through the Amber. "
the amber ,"Great! Room standard? Absolutely fantastic! It was so clean and beautiful. Client service? especially two people we spoke with were extremely professional and helpful: one lady at the reception and there was a man - i think he was the owner or manager - quite young, dressed really nice. The rest was just OK but those two! We were really impressed! But if I'm to complain... there were only two things that were a bit annoying but it's nothing especially that we're talking about India.First of all the room you can see with red blanket, stunning but we I had a look through the window... there is an eating area behind! And it would be ok because they are serving breakfasts only but in the morning it was a disaster. It was so noisy. The hotel staff was preparing this room for a breakfast from 5am. Talking, laughing and all the noises from the kitchen. We were really pissed off when we woke up at 5am and couldn't fall asleep especially that we arrived to the hotel in the middle of the night after a few 'interesting' experiences at the airport. Yes we were exhausted and planned to get up at 7am. Luckily there was no problem to change the room so the rest of our stay was great.2. Another thing: tipping. It was driving us bananas especially when ordered the food and a couple of beers. The guys was puffing pretending how tired he is because he had to get the food and especially beer from far away. Yeah right! He didn't do this himself! and than said he has no change so you don't have to tip him when you order your food. We already did ;) Oh and don't order any beer - it is too expensive and can't cool it down in the fridge anyway.So the above was the worst we experienced. Not too bad hey. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. "
the amber ,"Nice hotel; terrible location; unhelpful staff Amber is a very modern and brand new hotel with all of the luxurious touches of a 5 star hotel. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are average sized, and the ultra-modern bathroom is a very pleasant surprise. The evening manager was extremely helpful with our check-in, and put an effort to accommodate our requests.On the other hand, the morning reception staff had a huge attitude problem, and seem to have difficulty communicating with each other. They did not help with travel arrangements, and ended up directing us to one of the scariest bus stations in Delhi. (We ended up going to the Intercontinental hotel to get help with travel.)The location of this hotel also makes it awkward for pretty much everything. Sukhdev Vihar is also not the best part of town. We arrived rather late in the evening, and driving through the residential part of a sketchy neighborhood was not terribly comforting. We stayed in room 102 and the view onto the unfinished road outside was less than appealing.For the high cost of this hotel, we would have preferred to stay closer to Connaught Place. "
the amber ,"Excellent boutique hotel in Delhi stayed in Amber hotel with a friend of mine for three nights.what i love first about the hotel is the very friendly staff and the General Manager himself ,very helpful , always smiling and wiiling to help you anytime(they gave me a late check out till 4:00 pm).the lobby is beautifullly decorated ,with free internet in the rooms/lobby.the location is in a quite neighbourhood ,all major attractions are within 15 minutes drive distance.the rooms are clean and comfortable,with italian fitting in bathroom and rain showewith hot and cold water.Room service is quick and food is good and hotel seems to be well executed in all fields.i love the buffet breakfast and fresh fruits as well. "
the amber ,"Excellent hotel in Delhi One of my favourite boutique hotels in Delhi. If you fancy a splurge get one of their rooms, It feels like you are in English country house.Great room design and bathrooms in a beautiful townhouse. Good service too. Please note it is not a huge 5 star hotel so if that is what you are used to it may offer you the similar facilities. It is a new building with white floors and lots of character- and big on luxury.The location is great in a quite neighbourhood Make sure to sleep you quiter in this Hotel.all the serices are great,like room resvice,taxi service,laundry service and restaurant and of course all the staff is friendly as they are eager to serve you all the time. "
the amber ,"Way beyond my expectations! My stay at the Amber was perfect! The hotel is modern, elegant, and cozy. Showers were delicious (had a hard time finding those during my travelings!), rooms extremely clean, and the staff was very friendly and helpful with everything.Definitely the best hotel i stayed during my month long stay in India. Paid higher rates in other hotels and got much less for my money. Really recomend it!And if you get tired of the intense Indian spices, there are tons of western food options. "
the amber ,"It was nice to be pampered Found this hotel on Trip Advisor. All that was said in the reviews are true. Moreover one must emphasize that the reviews do not speak enough good about this place. The staff is fabulous, always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone. The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at 9 pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card.To me that was beyond the call of duty and that says it all.The kitchen is open 24 hours and the service and fare is superb. The whole place is decorated with marble floors , the bedrooms have wooden floors and is spotlessly clean including the linen.I have one small negative comment, and that is about the device that maintains water pressure which constantly pounds every several seconds , and heard mostly on the third floor.I mentioned it to the duty manager the next day and he said that he could have shut it off at night had I called the desk before I went to sleep.I would not hesitate to stay here again. "
the amber ,"Overrated Normally I swear by TripAdvisor and so booked this hotel based on all the excellent reviews. This was the last stop on our holiday to India and we were looking forward to staying in a hotel that appeared flawless! All other hotels we had stayed in on our trip had been super - and most of these recommended on this website. So, it was something of an anti-climax to arrive at the Amber at midnight after a 4 hour train journey to be met by a surly receptionist and what can only be decribed as a very average 2-night stay. To be fair there had been some early warning signs. I had tried to arrange a pick-up from the rail station a couple of weeks before we left for India, but their email address was consistently out of order (bizarre given this was the holiday period). I then phoned them to arrange a pick up but they had ran out of cars and were not able to assist in arranging a taxi. We managed to sort this out ourselves at the station without much bother. The room was certainly clean and very modern and with a great flat-screen TV. We had a Premium room which was quite small and the bathroom - albeit clean with lots of new fittings and hot water - was quite poky with nowhere to hang towels or put toiletries. It is certainly in a very quiet area (a good 30 mins from the center), but I think our room was above the water pump, which clanked loudly all night. Above all we found the service quite impersonal, and the breakfast was poor - there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu - the food was mediocre with instant coffee inspite of a state-of-the-art coffee maker that was used to froth the milk! This would have all been fine but the whole atmosphere was quite bizarre and a bit like eating in a hospital waiting room. When we came down to breakfast at 8am I thought we were in the wrong place as all the lights were off! They were quite helpful in ordering us taxis for day trips but very inflexible at the end of our stay, when we asked to keep the room an extra few hours after check-out time to wait for our flight, and we were asked to pay a full days rate with only 10% discount. We declined and ended up in a rather nice bar in town - given there is really nowhere to 'hang-out' in the hotel. All in all, the hotel was perfectly fine, but I think it would take more than a flat screen TV, and some chrome and marble fittings for me to give it such a high rating. We stayed in Delhi at Shanti Home earlier in our trip - and thats certainly where I would go back to again. "
the amber ,"Home from Home My family and I stayed at The Amber in October 2008. We had 1 Premium Room and 1 Executive Room. We did look at the other big hotels in New Deli, but decided to go with this smaller and very modern looking hotel and we were not disappointed with our choice. Both rooms were beautifully furnished with a very contemporary feel. The rooms looked exactly like the photos on the website and were very clean. Breakfast was very good and different every day. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you, nothing was too much trouble for them. We felt because the hotel was small, the service and attention to detail was of a very high standard. The location was good and pretty central. Although the hotel itself was in a residential area, it was only 15 minutes walk away from many shops and restaurants. It was also helpful that the hotel had a driver and a car available for day trips. This hotel was definitely a really good find. I'm sure next time we are in Delhi we will definitely be staying there again. "
the amber ,Very nice stay This is indeed a hotel that deserves its ranking. I booked this hotel because of its nice reviews here on tripadvisor and I agree with all the positive remarks already posted. Very nice and helpful staff. Large modern cleam rooms. Nice little restaurant. What more can you ask. 
the amber ,"Great boutique hotel We booked the Amber because of the reviews on here and we were not disapointed. We stayed on four different occasions during a month long trip to india and each time we went back it was at least as good as the last time.We stayed in the premium rooms which are slightly larger and offer free internet that works, multi channel big flat screen TV , coffeemaker in the room, mini bar etc etc - in fact every bit as good a room as the Taj Palace where we also stayed and just as clean. We stayed in 101 and 201.Meals are taken in the hotel lobby which is quite small but we also ate in our room several times. There is a 24 hour room service with basic things like club sandwiches and pizzas as well as some limited indian food that is very good but the hotel also sends out for food from three chosen restaurants - an Indian, a Chinese and an Italian - we chose the Indian and the food delivered in about 40 minutes was outstandingly good - way superior to the indian restaurant in the Taj Palace for example.Its also very inexpensive by western standards. We had no Delhi Belly problems whatsoever. Note they have no license for alcohol but will send out for beer and other drinks for you. Try Kingfisher beer in very big bottles for very small money - it goes great with a curry.The service is first class - from the smiling saluting security guard to the boys that take your cases. We left one suitcase and some packages with the hotel between visits with no problems and at no charge. We also used their very cheap and first class laundry service leaving clothes to be done between visits. Hard to criticise. Its in a quiet area quite a way from the airport and they could do a bit more with the roof terrace that would make a nice little sitting out area [ there is nowhere else to sit outside] but all in all this is an absolute gem. "
the amber ,"Excellent hotel! If you are afraid about cleanness, don't worry...it's very clean and comfortable. Besides, it's a new hotel so, everything is modern. The location is great. It's not a commercial centre. It's a residential zone, so it's calm.The services are also great. Very nice for business travelers and tourists. "
the amber ,"Nice Place to Stay in a Quieter part of Delhi The Amber was a pleasant surprise in a seemingly safe area of Delhi. Not much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but to be honest, the food in the hotel was great so we didn't need to venture out too far.The room (I had a Premium Room) which was extremely spacious was worth the small amount extra. The bathroom was massive and water was always hot which is not common in Delhi.Breakfast was basic but to be honest, substantial enough in the heat and before facing another day in Delhi.The only one thing that I thought could have been improved on was the quality of the drivers that the hotel called on as a taxi service. Many of them were quite rude and when we went sightseeing, they took us to where they thought we wanted to go rather than where we asked to go which was quite frustrating as we only had very limied time being there on business. I know this is not the hotels fault but it would be great if they used drivers that were friendly and more obliging.All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay there again. "
the amber ,"Best New Boutique Hotel in Delhi My fiance and I stayed recently at The Amber Hotel and we were very happy with this hotel. In fact this is the first review we've ever posted on TripAdvisor, because it's such a little gem of a hotel - we wouldn't be surprised if it overtakes the others in the rankings.We were looking for a middle-range luxury boutique hotel in Delhi - and if you've searched the net as much as we have you know there's probably less than 5 hotels in that category in Delhi.Delhi hotels seem to be 2 extremes: either extremely grand and expensive (aka The Imperial) or &quot;3-Star&quot; hotels - if you've stayed at a 3-star in Delhi, you know what to expect (basic facilities, a little outdated, not very modern, and a bit overpriced - so not always matching 3-4 star standards). So for a few extra dollars $150/night, we stayed at this very modern, quiet and up-and-coming hotel. We booked the Amber directly and we got complimentary breakfast included (nice assortment of pastries, toast, fruit etc....) - they also have a restaurant and breakfast buffet downstairs (nicely arranged next to an indoor water fountain). We were surprised by how modern the hotel is - didn't realised it's only less than 1 year old so everything looks new (furniture, bed linen, floors, pictures...). The room facilities were very good. They have the typical toiletries (complimentary shampoo - which incidentally is the same brand they use at The Imperial and that hotel is in the $300-$400 range!) But here's something we didn't get at The Imperial - a Hair Comb! We thought it was nice touch to get a personalised Comb that says &quot;The Amber&quot; (so we kept it). You also get very good towels, hairdryer, room slippers, shoe shine (we kept that too), tea/coffee facilities (though they could do with a few more chocolates in the fridge) and a very nice Plasma Cable TV.The service was very good and very personable. Because it's a smaller hotel you do interact with the same staff a lot more so it's not a different face every night serving you room-service or different person behind reception. They arranged some 'emergency' transportation for us (our planned driver had an unplanned accident) and suggested some restaurants nearby to eat out - so they were very helpful.In terms of negatives, it's a struggle to fnd some because they were honestly very good .... but if we had to say some... maybe 1 or 2 instances when we had to repeat a few things to clarify some things we were saying in english but it's trivial really.... the room service menu is huge but don't get too excited over the Pizza, the kitchen might not be prepared to make it - so please try their local dishes, they're very good. "
the amber ,"An oasis of calm and stylish luxury in Delhi - AND it's affordable! What a top-notch boutique hotel. This property is so well-executed that you'd seriously think that you were in Barcelona or Miami Beach. The rooms are comfortable and feature satellite television, the food is good, the bathrooms are immaculate - what else could you ask for in Delhi?I was only there for 12 hours in transit before catching an early morning train to Agra. The hotel was even nice enough to book my train ticket for me and had it ready when I checked in, saving me the horrible agony of having to pick it up at will call at the train station. Anyone who's ever dealt with buying or picking up a ticket an Indian railway station knows what I mean. They did charge a small service for this, but it was very reasonable (maybe only 200-300 rupees).The best/worst thing about the hotel is the location. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood which was perfect for people like me who didn't really want to be in Delhi in the first place, but it may seem kind of isolated to independent travelers who prefer to explore things on their own. You'd likely need to use the hotel car and driver to get anywhere as I didn't really see many taxis or rickshaws around there, but I was there in the middle of the night so maybe I just missed them. There is a big hospital across the street so I'm assuming that you probably could get one there. "
the amber ,"Excellent hotel! I saw the one review of the Amber and went to the hotel website and booked a room. I was really nervous about it since the rates were so much lower than other hotels in New Delhi, but I decided to give it a shot. Wow, was I impressed! This hotel is gorgeous. We arrived late at night and there was a security guard at the front door which I appreciated. The front desk staff was adequate, but not overly friendly. But the room was gorgeous. The basic room is exactly as depicted on the webiste. ...gorgeous wood floors, a very comfortable bed, a nice modern bathroom, a great TV, and the list goes on. We were on the inside facing into the courtyard area so I heard zero street noise. My only advice is too book your own driver, as their driver service was about twice as much as the other quotes we got from other companies.We did not try the breakfast, but one morning there was a buffet which was included in the room rate. But the next morning there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu and it was included in the room rate as well.I would definitely stay here again. "
the amber ,"Excellent Boutique Hotel An excellent property of a converted Delhi mansion in the South of Delhi. AmbianceA modern glass and marble entrance to a front desk with a small seating area and adjoining dining tables. This was obviously the living room / dining room of the home. There is a smal courtyard that rises all the way thru the four floors of the hotel. LocationCentral location in Delhi about 20 minutes from the rail station and 40 from the airport with typical Delhi traffic. I am not sure whether the location might be a bit hard to find by a typical cab driver as the building is in a residential area. The RoomA modern European architecture with the mix of fine wood and glass finish. The room is well appointed with large closets, a LCD TV, mini-bar and many other amneties can be secured through the front desk. (i.e. DVD Players, etc). A great selection of channels as they are using the Tata premium satellite service a feature that not even The Imperial Hotel currently offers. This might sound a bit unimportant but when one is traveling thru India, most TV reception is restricted to a slate of 3 or 4 English speaking channels. The bed was firm and comfortable and bedding was of excellent quality. The pillows were plenty and quite comfortable. The restroom is well appointed with a glass encased rainfall shower and hot water was a plenty; ServiceExcellent response and attention as one should expect in India. The staff was very helpful and attentive and could easily communicate via Hindi or English. The only misstep was when it took a bit long for the room service to be cleared out.FoodI arrived very late in the evening and the kitchen was able to create a good replica of Penne Bolognese. The food come within 20 minutes after the kitchen captain came up to the room for the order. PriceA very good value at 6500-7500 Rupees. Similar 4/5 star hotels will be in the 9000-15000 Rupees. The food service was actually relatively inexpensive for this type of hotel in India. Usually I would spend 600-800 Rupees for a meal and my bill came under 300. Final Comments:Actually a bit hesitant in posting this review as this hotel almost qualifies as a hidden gem and jeopardize their availability for my next stay trip to Delhi. However, I was so favorably impressed from my usual stays at The Imperial, Taj or Ambassador, that they well deserve it. "
the amber ,Hotel sympatique 
the claridges ,"Great hotel great people Here came my holidays....and the selection was Hotel Claridges in Delhi for my trip to the Golden Triangle.Great hotel , great people, and great services...all being met at one place.Our stay at this hotel inspired us to come back to our native place and ofcourse...we will definitely stay at Hotel Claridges Delhi "
the claridges ,"Great place to stay We had two stays here at either end of a Golden Triangle tour. The hotel was very plush, we had a deluxe room which was spacious and well decorated. Also impressed by the slippers / bathrobe in the wardrobe!The pool and surrounding area was lovely, just a shame the sun went behind the surrounding buildings pretty early!Renovations were ongoing during our stay, however did not cause us any real disturbance aside from hearing drilling one afternoon by the pool.The service was a little variable, and it's this which prevented me rating this as a 5. The door staff, porters &amp; housekeeping staff were excellent - very friendly and chatty. The reception staff were polite but indifferent, and the Pickwicks restaurant staff did not seem particularly interested at all.We tried the food in the Jade chinese restaurant which was superb, also Pickwicks for breakfast and an evening meal. The food here was excellent, however the service let the place down. Our drinks were forgotten, we asked for extra butter at breakfast which never arrived &amp; the service was extremely slow. "
the claridges ,"Out of town this is an oasis! Near the house where Ghandi was shot but you have to turn the gauntlet of beggars,tuktuk drivers and performing kids just to get there!It is a 20 min taxi ride to Red Fort and other attractions.Service very good and rooms fine. "
the claridges ,class From the moment we arrived to the moment we left ab fab.Could not fault hotel.If to make a minus it would be the price of food in the restraunt.Other than that perfect 
the claridges ,"An oasis of calm and charm in a the madness that is Delhi We booked two separate nights at The Claridges; one at the start and one at the end of a two week trip north to the Himalayas. Both arrival times at the hotel were early in the morning. Expecting to wait around for the midday check in, we were greeted by friendly, efficient and polite staff and were found rooms almost immediately - one at 7 o'clock in the morning. Whisked up to our room by a smiling floor manager in an impeccable suit we were given a clean comfy mini suite with a huge bed and huge screen TV. There were no extra charges for the early check ins.The two restaurants we used were well staffed by smiling, helpful people. Breakfast was a fresh and plentiful buffet with hot choices cooked in front of you. For dinner we chose the European option (there are 4 restaurants). We were escorted by a delightful chatty receptionist to the rear of the building where we were seated on an atmospheric terrace with a stream and billowing muslin drapes. The food was excellent, not quite Michelin, but my steak was cooked just right and a reasonable French red wine at about 20 GBP completed the evening.Having an afternoon to fill, we walked towards a New Delhi local market. We were stopped by a Tuc Tuc man who promised to show us Delhi. A bit wary but with the assurance of a friendly passer by, we bit the bullet. Kamal, our Tuc Tuc man, as he turned out to be called did show us Delhi. Safely, patiently and with good English he took us to a few of the best sites and to the best place to buy a great silk Kashmiri rug. We can thoroughly recommend Kamal as a reliable and knowledgeable driver. He charged us 300 rupees for the round trip (about 3.75 GBP) including waiting for us when we went sightseeing. He can be found on his mobile - 9899041746 - give him a ring!!Overall a great Hotel experience - good security (24 hour armed police presence in the background) - lovely staff - everthing worked - good food - a real oasis of calm and charm in the madness that is Delhi. "
the claridges ,"Never never never again!!!! What a dreadful experience! We had previously stayed at the Taj Palace - incomparably superior - and found The Claridges grossly inadequate. The refurbishment wasn't complete, we had to have the plumber TWICE in one evening, there was no storage in the bathroom, and the shower soakaway was unable to deal with the inout from the shower. Worst of all, there was hammering going on under our room until 4.30 a.m despite repeated calls to Reception and the Duty Manager. As a result we had a sleep-free night and were far too shattered to do the visits we had planned for the next morning. Totally unacceptable, and never a word of apology, let alone any compensation. The hotel should be thoroughly ashamed of itself. "
the claridges ,"Golden triangle tour India The Claridges hotel in New Delhi was superb, the food in each of the Restaurants was wonderful, the rooms have been refurbished recently and are extremely comfortable and well furnished. There are so many little touches that made it a fantastic stay, everything you need has been thought of and readily available.I did find it unusual that the Spa was single sex at different times of the day, but this did not mar our stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New Delhi. "
the claridges ,"Above average hotel with below average service The hotel is centrally located in the embassy area near Khan Market. Although Khan Market can be walked in about 15-20 minutes, it is advisable to take a taxi or ask your driver to drop you off at the market and take a taxi back to the hotel. The check-in process at about 1:30am was fast and being upgraded to a suite for 3 nights was appreciated. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean. 4 complimentary bottles of water every day helped beat the heat and potential bout with diarrhea. 24 hour internet use was not complimentary and set us back about $15 per day.The below average score for &quot;Service&quot; was due to the lackadaisical attitude and lack of attention to detail of the wait staff for breakfast and dinner at Dhaba. Coffee and refills were not served in a timely fashion for the entire stay of 3 days. On the 3rd morning, I observed the female host take something from the serving table and quickly put it in her mouth as she was walking towards the pastry area. Except for the doorman, a lot of the staff did not acknowledge us with a smile even when I said good morning. The reception area staff were also not friendly although they did what they were supposed to do.Food at Dhaba Restaurant was expensive with the taste average at best. I would recommend heading over to the Khan market to eat at Chonas (Indian food), Salim's (kebab rolls), change money and shop a little bit.In regards to the &quot;soft remodel&quot; noise reported by guests, I did not hear any construction noise during our stay. According to the hotel, the remodel will be complete by the end of October 2009. Speaking of currency exchange, change as much as you can at the Punjab Bank (no commission) vs Thomas Cook (10% commission). For a hotel that has a lot of positives, Claridges Hotel will be an option for me to consider but it is not a hotel that I can say that I will definitely go back to if another alternative is available. "
the claridges ,"Potentially good - but management dealings with us unacceptable. We had a two night stay and the first night went to plan. Room was as anticipated in a superior category. Good meal in the Chinese restaurant. Great position for hotel. Waiters very polite and friendly although food service very slow. Then all went downhill - returned at 4pm after a day in Delhi to be accosted by the duty manager because a problem with the plumbing near our room had removed water from half of the rooms. He had been trying to contact us for many hours because engineers needed to gain access to our room for the repair work and we needed to change rooms to allow this to happen. Replacement room much smaller, and much less well equipped - bathroom actually quite basic, less fruit and no sweet-meats but otherwise adequate. As we were checking out during the night we accepted the down-grade room rather than make a fuss.Curiously the only person who was aware of the &quot;plumbing problem&quot; appeared to be the one duty manager despite the devastating effect the &quot;problem&quot; had been having for some hours. We also discovered subsequently that all rooms in Claridges were booked that night and the room we had been asked to vacate was re-occupied.Our new room, unlike the first room, overlooked an area of the hotel where parties were held: there was a party that night (we had not been informed of this) and sleep was impossible because of the resulting Bacchanalian-like noise. On checkout I spoke to the night duty manager who apologised for the extreme noise. He, too, was also unaware of the &quot;plumbing problem&quot; until we told him. He confirmed also that the room vacated by us was re-occupied. The hotel was completely full.The speed of the resolution of the &quot;plumbing problem&quot;, the rapid re-allocation of that room to someone else and not back to us, and the seeming lack of knowledge of the &quot;plumbing problem&quot; by anyone other than the one duty manager amongst many despite its apparent widespread effect for so many hours, and the absence of any urgency in resolving the problem (the management did not know we would be returning in the late afternoon - we could have planned to stay out until very late) all suggest to us that there may have been another reason we were asked to move. Whether there was we cannot be certain but it is difficult to identify any other credible explanation on the information provided by this manager on the 12th October. In the end the room downgrade, for whatever reason, was not acceptable. We feel that we were treated entirely inappropriately by the management of this hotel. It has left a very unpleasant &quot;taste&quot;. "
the claridges ,"Perfect hotel Friendly, smiley service with a buzzing atmosphere. Beautiful room. Afternoon drinks on the lawn. Lovely chinese restaurant. Did not want to leave. We loved this hotel - new favourite in Delhi (usually stay at Imperial) "
the claridges ,"Made India tolerable The hotel was beautiful and made my stay in India tolerable. However, I mistakenly took 1 sip of water from the faucet and my stomach was not right for 1 week. Beware of India's tap water! "
the claridges ,Little value for big money This hotel is ideally located in the centre of Delhi but is way too expensive for what it is. The rooms are spacious but bathrooms could do some work. The hotel was under renovations when we visited. Internet was extremely expensive. Beware Tthe restaurants at this hotel are also over priced. Also book in advance and maybe pay online. This will save you from having to bargain at the reception. The first 5 star hotel that i had to bargain the price. The guy in the in front desk started at 200 euro! We ended up paying about half that amount but left feeling that we were over charged. They asked for an advance charge of 175 euro per room which was returned on my card but which was charged on my friend's card. Paying online would have saved us all this hassle. Not a bad place to stay if you don't mind paying through the nose. On my next trip to Delhi I would look for better deal value wise. 
the claridges ,"one of the most centrally located 5 star hoetsl in delhi claridges is located 5 mins khan market and lodhi garden and is one of the most centrally located 5 stars in delhi.. in the heart of lueytans delhi, its one of the best places for a business meeting or just staying if you have a budget problem. they have a 24 hour coffee shop, sevilla- spainsh restaurant which has one of the best ambience in delhi and is worth eating in, in winters as its open air.. a vodka lounge with one of the best stocked bars in town. the service is excellent and so is the pool and the business facilities.. unlike other multi storyed hotels in delhi, the rooms dont have a dominating view of the area but they are extremely plesant and clean.. stayaing is claridges is an expensive and also it tends to be booked heavily during marriage season and winters so its advisable to book in advance. "
the claridges ,Claridge's was wonderful Really nice hotel with exceptionally courteous staff. Very clean and nice rooms. The breakfast buffet was very good. 
the claridges ,"claridge is classy but not always perfect The Claridge is definitely classy: great furniture, beautiful colours, interesting architecture... In addition, it is well located for dealing with embassies, or to go the bustling activities of connaught place, a short taxi hop.Still, not everything works perfectly in the claridge: rooms are uneven, with some without any views, some noisy and some with rusted pipe fittings. These are easily forgotten if you manage to get a good deal. But if you are paying above 200 USD and you room is still average, you may wonder if another choice would have been wiser. On the other hand, most of luxury hotels in Delhi are expansive during high season, so you may just enjoy the very elegant setting and furniture of the claridge... "
the claridges ,"TIMELY ROOM SERVICECOURTEOUS STAFF AND A GOOD LOUNGE We had checked in after a hectic business day after doing 2-3 rounds of meeting in the ncr region.we were immediately ushered into the lounge and provided with our rooms.though our stay at the hotel was for a minimal time[3days], we never had to confront any inconvenience in getting service.They have a wonderful Conference Room-The Senate for business meetings.i would highly recommend this place for business meetings. The staff was very helpful in showing me the entire facilities here.They also have a beautiful garden and a lounge bar.Ideal &amp; affordable place if you want to stay in delhi.[specially in these days ] "
the claridges ,EXPENSIVE HOTEL NOT VALUE FOR MONEY The hotel is located centrally in new delhi and it very convenient for business visitors. Its gym and pool is merely functional. The people are nice and warm. Breakfast is ordinary and the lobby is only acceptable. Their charges for health clubs are very high. 
the claridges ,"Great with the basics bad with the extras My friends and I stayed here two nights in a row. The first night we were in a deluxe room we had booked online (the deluxe and claridges room were listed at the same rate), and the second night we had planned to switch to the Ginger to save money but didn't feel safe (we were a group of 3 20-something women) so returned to the Claridges in a Claridges room.Both rooms were great, though obviously the deluxe room was bigger and had tile instead of carpeted flooring.The service seemed great. We always were warmly welcomed, and the front desk staff was very friendly. When we grabbed breakfast the second morning, the hostess even remembered our original room number.However, there were a couple service issues. The first night we discovered the outlets weren't working. We called for the electrician and were told he would be coming. 30 minutes later, no electrician. My friend called again and they say he'd be there right away. 15 minutes later, he still hasn't come. My friend called yet again to complain, and finally he came 15 minutes after that, a full hour after we originally called.Luckily our friends took an hour longer than anticipated to pick us up to go out for the night - otherwise we would have hit the clubs with wet hair! :)The second issue was very frustrating. We had plans to leave at 7am to drive to Agra. It was important to leave early to beat Delhi rush hour and make it in time to see the Taj and drive to Jaipur before dark. We called for a wake-up call at 6:15. The receptionist asked if we'd like a confirmation call at 6:30, and we said yes.We received no call and woke up at 7:10 when our driver called to see where we were. My friend called to complain and they said that they didn't have us down for a wakeup call. At checkout we complained, and then the woman in charge of the wake-up call told the manager that she did call and we didn't pick up. We responded that it was [--------], and finally got 2000 rupees taken off our final bill.Point of story- stay at the Claridges and enjoy the beautiful garden and amazing mediterranean restaurant. Just don't count on anything outside the pre-choreographed dance when it comes to service. Bring your own alarm! :) "
the claridges ,"Excellent value - good service - friendly staff We had the pleasure of staying here one week apart and in different sections of the hotel. Our first bout of stay was excellent - staff were helpful polite and accommodating - the service in the restuarants was excellent - rooms were very nice - just by the pool - all in all on this occasion the hotel was very good.However, on our second visit to the hotel - the only complaint we had was the room - we were on the first floor and the rooms above are being renovated therefore there was quite a considerable amount of disturbance during the day and this went on to approximately 10.30 at night. However, as we were only staying one night this time we felt we could put up with it - if we had been staying longer we certainly would have asked to be moved to a quieter room. The room itself was lovely - and once again the staff were excellent. All in all a very nice hotel and a good stay. "
the claridges ,"A great Place to Stay in New Delhi My wife and I stayed at The Claridges two different times between March 10 and April 1, 2009. Each time we were greeted warmly and made to feel at home. Our first room was on the first floor off the pool area and had a sliding door that gave us access there. It was quiet at night and we had it all to ourselves. We ate at two of the restaurants, both reasonably priced and with wholesome, mostly vegetarian fare (but thats about what you get in India). One of the hotel shops is a bakery. We bought some pastries to eat in the room with tea. The hotel provided china dishes, napkins and silverware for us to enjoy our treats. Just a short walk down the block is a house owned by the wealthy Birla family at which MK Gandhi stayed near the end of his life. It is open to the public and has artifacts of the great man and dipictions of the important events of his life as well as impressive statues and gardens. "
the claridges ,"No complaints Stayed for 3 nights at the end of a visit to north India. I have no complaints about Claridges and found it to be a very good hotel. Location was in the posh diplomatic area of New Delhi, lobby was elegant and luxurious, and staff were very helpful and friendly. I insisted on a refurbished room and found this to be excellent. The room came with a balcony and a small wardrobe/dressing room leading to the bathroom. This small wardrobe/dressing room was poorly lit but otherwise I was very happy with the room. There was a large flat screen TV and internet access (payable), no road noise and a generally comforable feel to the room. Breakfast was tasty with good choices. We had an offer of free spa treatment for staying 3 nights but we found that men and women had different times for accessing the spa and we could not be there together-strange. "
the claridges ,"Unusual (but excellent) experience So I understand that other people who have stayed here have had bad experiences, and I'm not going to dispute those, as our experience was probably fairly exceptional. We stayed here for our 1st wedding anniversary, booking into a Claridges Room for one night only (as far our budget could stretch!). On our internet booking form we mentioned it was our anniversary, and so when we arrived they automatically upgraded us to a Club Room, which we thought was very nice of them. Upon being in the room for about half an hour we noticed that the room was actually really cold, and that the air-con wouldn't turn down. We rang through to report this but non one came to fix it. After another while I went out to the lobby to find the duty manager, who immediately sent a squadron of people into the room to try and fix it, which they couldn't do. We were instead immediately upgraded again, this time to the Luxury Suite (so by now we'd been given the equivalent of 4 upgrades), which was simply stunning. They then delivered 24 red roses for my wife! The service and staff all along were friendly and attentive, and the food in the restaurant, Dhaba, was divine, with again, excellent service. We only stayed one night, so maybe if we'd stayed longer things would have started to go downhill (judging from other people's reviews) but I can't really attest to this, but essentially, we got a $500 room for $150, so we weren't complaining! "
the claridges ,"Poor quality of the rooms Stayed here for the first time in March 2009. I visit Delhi regularly and have stayed at a number of other 5 star hotels. Service at the hotel is excellent, people are friendly, but there is one major problem: The quality of the rooms. My room was in urgent need of renovation, one chair was wobbly and even dangerous to sit on, the bathroom was just shabby for a five star hotel. Morevoer, it had only a tiny window, and when you looked outside, you were staring at a wall, one metre away from the window. I checked the other rooms in my corridor and found them similar. Clearly, based on my experience, the Claridges is the most inferior five star hotel in Delhi, in terms of room quality. "
the claridges ,"Lousy Whilst externally everything looks fine ,in details it isn't.I stayed for 2 seperate stays with a couple of days in between.On both stays the bathrooms have mould and fungus all over so whilst the Molton Brown toiletries are nice mould isn't so nice.the internet which is costly is intermittent.The staff at the reception try to look extremely friendly but are are on another planet.an example is when i checked in I requested them to check up with my airline if they were on to send a free complimentary car as I had booked;no body bothered.They habitually try to multitask like when checking you out attend to other things and are not able and delay you.On my second stay i asked for a room (after the first stay had a lousy room) with a view but they put me in one (236) where the glass is covered in a film so you can't look out at all as it looks out over some equipment !!).The room doors vibrated everytime someone walked past in the corridor outside.On the positive side the Dhaba restaurant was good as was the beds and linen in terms of comfort.Many nice alternative places to stay. "
the claridges ,"Agree - turnaround now I too was part of the trip where a watch was stolen and a couple of strong men tried to get us to sign a letter saying that it was lost in Khan market. Then the check-out clerk asked if we had a good experience, &quot;apart from the theft.&quot; Sorry, but this is not okay, even by Indian standards. "
the claridges ,"Having stayed here before... ...Having stayed here in December 2005, we were familiar with the Hotel and loved the service then and it was similar now, with heightened security, of course. As a family of 12 traveling together, we had 3 different rooms, and all were comfortable and suited our rather short stay. Dinner and Breakfast at Pickwicks was great as all our picky-palates were thoroughly pleased. We will stay here again if we go back to our roots. "
the claridges ,"Needs a turnaround - now! Facilities are good but the service is terrible. Here is a listing of some of my experiences as well as those of my classmates from Columbia Business School staying at The Claridges this January:1) My roommate and I had to request a total of about 6 times to get a phone replaced from our room2) The hotel ran out of double bed rooms. Many of my classmates had to stay in a room with a king size bed and a cot. Not the most comfortable situation - and they were not offering concessions at the time. Let's see if they change their mind.3) A classmate had a $4K watch disappear from her room. She requested to file a police report. The hotel urged her not to file. When finally they realized she had to file, they changed the report so that it stated that my classmate knowingly dropped the watch outside of The Claridges' premises. This report was rejected three times before a proper report was filed.4) I was overcharged for Internet usage - the man at the counter had a difficult time using a calculator when I was demonstrating how much I had been overcharged.5) I asked for a weight scale - the first request was ignored. I called 20 minutes later to ask about my weight scale. The response - &quot;Oh I am sending someone just now.&quot; 5 minutes later, a guy shows up with a ruler. 6) Though we had booked a conference room in advance, we were given their bar as a conference room because they overbooked other rooms.7) Learned that the best strategy to get food in the restaurants is to order it from three different people - that way one of them might actually bring it to you.8) Once I arrived at the hotel, a gentlemen helped bring my bags to my room. I tipped the guy 30 rupees and asked him if he would also take my shoes for a shine (a shoe shine is complimentary at this place). The guy refused to take my shoes (would not even touch my shoes) since he was not the shoe guy. He actually called someone to take the shoes, since holding shoes would be beneath him.9) Room internet was not working so I asked IT support to help me out. No one showed up for 30 minutes. I called to inquire about why. The response was that there was a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. I went outside to take a look, as the &quot;Do not disturb sign&quot; was inside my room. It was a &quot;Clean My Room&quot; sign. The IT guy showed up 5 minutes later, and tried to prove to me that the internet was working. 20 minutes later, he agreed that the internet was not working. No apologies from The Claridges.10) A classmate ordered a samosa for room service. She specifically asked the guy whether or not the samosa would have nuts, as she is allergic to all nuts. The guy assured her that there are no nuts in the samosas. My classmate bit into the samosa to find a cashew. She called down to complain in a panic. The management did not believe her, so they sent someone to inspect the samosa. They then asked the room service representative why he did not tell my classmate there would be cashews inside. The guy refused to admit fault and said that my friend was only asking about peanuts.Have many more stories, but I think you get the point... "
the claridges ,Comfortable but needs to be updated We stayed in a 2nd floor non-smoking room for 2 nights in Dec. 2008. The room was clean and the beds were super comfortable but the hotel rooms/bath had obviously not been updated in a long time whereas the lobby area and bathrooms in the lobby have recenlty had a facelift. Breakfast at the Pickwick's restaurant was outstanding as was the hotel staff/service. We had dinner at Dhaba ( in the hotel) the first night - excellent Indian food with just the right amount of spice. We ate at the hotel's outside restaurant Sevilla (mediterranean) the next night which was fine but nothing special - also a bit pricey for what it offered. Probably would not stay here again. 
the claridges ,"Wouldn't go again We had booked a Claridges room but weren't informed in advance that all these rooms are smoking rooms. Also, the first room we were offered overlooked a massive air conditioning unit on the roof. The manager said they could remove the ashtrays and spray air freshner which would make it non-smoking!! We ended up paying for an upgrade which was a disappointing start to our holiday.Apart from that, the hotel is okay. It is a lovely building and the bar and restaurants are pretty good, however we would not stay there again. "
the claridges ,"Awful. Tried as an alternative to the Imperial which is getting a litle bit above itself.. wish I had not. Had a second floor club room, the lift renovations included drilling until 8pm . Room ok but the cream carpet was filthy in one area and the huge tv was great except the picture was poor. The staff are arrogant, service slow and the &quot;famous&quot; bakery shut. I would have expected an explanation/ apology in the room. Trying to be something its sadly not. "
the claridges ,"Mixed feelings Stayed here three times during October '08. Some refurbishment being undertaken which was obtrusive to people in rooms around the pool area on the ground floor. One lift out of use causing huge queues when groups checked in. The decoration was good and I have no complaints about my rooms. The check in process was long and even at 7pm with a booking going back months, my room was not ready. The cashier needs to be watched, he tried to double charge me twice out of the three visits for my room bill. The rest of the staff were attentive without being obtrusive, the food was good, plentiful and varied. I would recommend this hotel as it is well located but with the caveats of being prepared to wait for your room and keeping a close eye on what you are charged. "
the claridges ,Very comfortable but it seemed a bit pricey Great service and a lovely hotel. The rooms were large and well decorated. The bathroom decor could do with a freshen up but that is being a bit picky.I thoroughly enjoyed.Like a lot of Indian Hotels though. It was pretty expensive. The pool area wasn't anything to get excited about but the service was good around the pool.The hotels retaurants were all good in their own way. My favourite was probably the Italian restaurant. 
the claridges ,"A game of two halves My experience was mixed with this hotel, having stayed for two nights seperated by a week. Overall I would consider it a fine hotel with one or two issues. The entrance and public rooms are appealling but I would advise anyone to avoid a ground floor room if possible, like other reviewers we had a dog of a room on the first night, clean but smelly, with the sheets on the bed feeling decidely damp and unpleasant, like sleeping in a puddle. The food in the Indian restaurant was, in my opinion, good and worth the cost and the informal breakfast room was also very acceptable with a varied range of food, staff in both were efficient and intent on providing a pleasant experience. Our second room was much better, airy, bright with good facilities and a small balcony. One gripe, I asked a member of staff to change some money before we had been allocated a room and it was as if I had asked him to solve the meaning of life.Overall though I would reccomend this hotel as a stop in Delhi, good garden to sit and have coffee, good location, friendly staff (in general) but just avoid a ground floor room, and change some cash after you have booked in! "
the claridges ,"Not first class I was told this was a first class hotel, but it certainly isn't. It might have a marble entrance hall, but that's about it. We stayed here twice at the begiinning and the end of our holiday. The rooms were tired, smelled of smoke and were grubby. Ours wasn't even ready when we checked in at 7 o'clock at night! The food is pretty awful and certainly not what you would expect of a supposedly smart hotel. "
the claridges ,"Definitely not worth the price I was part of a group that attended a meeting at the hotel last month. The airconditioning in the rooms was hopeless and switched on and off automatically with the result that the room temperature was either cold or hot - not ideal if one wishes to have a good night's sleep. The hotel was also very noisy with workers working through the night and making so much noise that it seems that they were determined that no one else should sleep. During the meeting, the power went off several times and the back up power supply did not seem to work. But this was not the worst experience. After a couple of days of long and tiring field trips outside Delhi, we came back to the hotel for our last night to find that the rooms were not ready and several of us were asked to wait until the guests had checked out for their after-midnight flights. We could understand this happening when one arrives in the morning but at 11pm, this was never heard of, considering that each one of us had booked weeks ahead. As this affected several of us, it was clear that this was not a mistake but a deliberate management ploy to make money by renting each room twice in a single night. So any body thinking of staying at the Claridges, be warned! "
the claridges ,"Fab breakfast Lovely hotel with a colonial feel. Good location within easy access to the sights of New Delhi and Old Delhi. The breakfast we had was the best of anywhere we stayed with a good choice, lots of fresh fruit and best of all soya milk. The only negative was the bar which was dark and dingy and very expensive. "
the claridges ,"A once good place running down We stayed in the Claridges in Delhi as a first stop on our honeymoon trip through India.When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed it looked quite nice and well laid out for it's hotel class, until we went to the room. At this stage it appeared the claridges had lost some of it's former charm.The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the stay, so from that aspect they do have that part down and organised.However, the rooms were small and wearing down. From our room we had a view over the inner-courtyard and swimming pool, and the rest of the building appears just as run-down and worse for wear.the bathroom although well equipped and neatly furbished, was still on the small side.the outside pool area was also a bit on the small side, and sat on an inner courtyard overlooked by the hotel from all angles. The pool itself was well maintained otherwise and served it's purpose.We had a chance to wander round the rest of the hotel, and found some restaurants connected to the hotel which look interesting and appealing, although we had dinner plans elsewhere for that one night, thus did not get a chance to try them.As for breakfast, this was well managed and nicely spread, with a good choice of continental and Indian fare.Overall it's obviously a five-star service, but in a building that is quickly running down and not being maintained.The hotel needs a refurbishment to match it's staff's efforts. "
the claridges ,"underwhelming experience this was a disappointing experience.... on arriving we had to change the room as the first option stank of smoke... the new room had a leaky bathroom and noisy aircon, although was otherwise decent... the breakfast was good, although there is no excuse for clearing it away at 10.25, when they are meant to be serving till 1030... the staff were generally pleasant and aspired to be helpful, though were often clueless about delhi... the amenities were poorly staffed and substandard: dirty pool, unstaffed business centre, not very good massage... while this wasn't a disaster, I thought for the price they were charging it should have been a lot more slick... "
the claridges ,"Claridges Delhi This hotel was nothing more than average - but quite expensive.The food was good but average too - but very expensive. We ate out after the first night at a 1/3 of the rate! The rooms were clean but the AC was quite noisy.They should offer free wifi at the room rates they charge.The gym is small but well equiped, the sauna average, the whirlpool doesn't work. "
the claridges ,"No carpets please A little background first: My husband has been working in India. I flew over to join him in Delhi for a week. Thus we arrived in Delhi from different directions at different times. I arrived at 2am from Australia while my husband arrived at 7pm that evening via an internal Indian flight.I booked a Club Room with twin beds. The charge including buffet breakfast for two in Pickwicks Restaurant &amp; taxes etc was $368 Australian dollars per night. As arranged with the hotel via email prior to my arrival, there was a chauffeur-driven car waiting with my name on a sign for me at the airport. This service costs about AU$56 one way.The hotel check-in service at 3am was well managed and took place in the room rather than the front counter. A hostess showed me to my room on the first floor which looked exactly as it did on the website. However the photos do not provide smell. As I stepped into the room there was an overpowering musty damp carpet smell. I informed them that I would not be able to stay in the room with this smell. We tried to open the window but this was not possible. Another room - across the hall - was immediately offered as a replacement for the remainder of the night. This room also had carpet and a lingering musty smell but it did have an opening glass door onto a landing overlooking the pool so it was possible to get fresh air. I believe this was a Claridges Room.As this room had a king sized bed instead of twin beds I informed them that it would not be suitable once my husband arrived. They assured me that another Club Room would be available for me in the morning. When I followed this up after housemaid service in the morning - a Club Room on the 2nd Floor was offered to me. This room had marble floors - no musty smell at all. It was fresh, clean and spacious. Also, the bathroom in a Club Room is larger than in the Claridges room. It has a separate bath and shower with a large vanity. Whereas in the Claridges room the shower was over the bath and the bathroom was only large enough for one person at a time.Breakfast in Pickwicks Restaurant had everything you expect in a western buffet breakfast. Fresh &amp; tinned fruit, French yoghurts, cereal, cook your own toast, pastries, breakfast cakes, eggs cooked to order, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and also Indian breakfast. Staff are eager to please and attentive and even provided us with a container of pastries &amp; cakes when we advised that we were driving to Agra for the day.Note: It takes 5 hours to drive to Agra from Delhi.There is a very good Bakery in the hotel. The prices are a little cheaper than in Australia but pricey by Indian standards. However the quality was excellent and ideal if you want a light snack in your room instead of a full meal for lunch or dinner. Mini bar items are overpriced like every hotel. Although the bottled water was probably the most extreme. I think it worked out at AU $5 for 1 litre bottle. You can buy the same cold at a roadside stall for less than 40 cents. (15 INR).However 3 x 500ml bottles of water are included in the daily room rate. One in the bathroom to brush your teeth and 2 with the complimentary tea/coffee items.The staff at Claridges were polite and efficient but I couldn't help feeling that they were always waiting for a tip. Being Australian I am not accustomed to tipping and do it badly. I feel uncomfortable when someone hangs around like a bad smell waiting for a tip. I also felt that they were doing no more than their job and did not warrant a tip (but perhaps that is an Australian attitude)The housekeeping facilities are very good, with sheets &amp; towels changed daily and toilettries replenished. The only issue I had was with the quality of the towels. I must admit to a towel fettish here, so you may discount my comments if you don't have the same fettish. The towels at Claridges were not up to spec. While they were soft, they were not particularly absorbent and you were left with a slightly damp feeling after using them.We didn't use the evening turn-down service as it was at 6-6.30pm when we were either in the shower or getting dressed for dinner and didn't want hotel staff in the room at that time.The internet speed in the Business Centre (3 computers and a dodgy printer in a shabby basement room) is very slow. It was not possible to attach photos or word documents to emails. The system would crash while trying to upload. Short emails were all that was possible. This was a pay per hour service.So overall: A beautiful, clean, well maintained hotel. The &quot;look&quot; of the hotel is opulent. Staff are polite &amp; efficient as long as your request is within their past experience. The negatives are the poor Internet facilities and the towels. "
the claridges ,"Very nice hotel in a nice area I had a very nice stay at this hotel. The room was nicely decorated with nice ammenities. There is a very modern-clublike bar. I ate at two of the restaurants....the cafe for several meals, and the spanish restaurant which as a very nice outdoor atmosphere. The food was good at both. The hotel arranged an excellant driver. The pool area is pleasant with good service.....I have no complaints with this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again. "
the claridges ,"Mixed feelings We were doing the Great Rail Journey Palace on Wheels trip so we stayed in this hotel 3 times and had 3 different rooms. First room on ground floor (2 nights) with doors into garden and pool area. Lovely room. Bed very hard! Noisy at night due to tiled marble corridor and lots of people moving about. Nice amenities - robes, slippers, etc. Second room a few nights later (1 night) was awful. Stained carpet, No window!!! When I opened the curtain it was just a blanked out window. Good job it was only for one night. Would not have put up with any more. Third room on our last night of the holiday was much better. Several people in our group had a similar experience, being in rooms where the windows were blanked out. The pool area is very nice but there were only 8 sunbeds when we were there. Not enough. The hotel is looking a little 'tired' in places. There were a number of areas that needed smartening up. However, the staff were lovely and service was great overall. Food was good. Try the pancakes for breakfast! "
the claridges ,"Excellent hotel to combine business and pleasure Very friendly and efficient service throughout our three day stay. Staff are discrete, personal and help you feel so welcome. Attentive to every need - Senate club very relaxing - a genuine stress buster. Large bright comfortable room. Pickwicks restaurant good value but can become crowded. Very European feel to this place and airconditioning is definitely efficient. If you are travelling in heat of summer this place should be good. "
the claridges ,"Just right for arriving in India We arrived in India and went straight to the hotel - it was luxurious, beautiful and felt nice and safe, just what you need when arriving in a foreign quite scary city. It has all the stuff we grew to expect - you have to tip everyone and the telephone sometimes didn't work and things that you expect to work like the shower button were a bit dodgy but - hey - it was actually the best of the Indian hotels in terms of comfort and facilities. I went and used their beauty parlour and had a head massage which was very cheap and very good. We ate in one of the onsite restaurants the first night - big mistake as it was very expensive and we wern't business people eating on the company account but tourists saving our pennies for other stuff. We actually stayed twice at the Claridges and the second time they upgraded us to a suite whcih was sumptuous and breakfast was in a special separate suite-people-only place (no riff raff - we fitted right in as you can imagine!) and we had room service then which was terrific - much cheaper than the restuarants and fantastic food beautifully presented. I would happily go again! "
the claridges ,Best part of two weeks in India We were given the Claridge through our package tour. The lodging was a highlight of the trip thanks to the hospitality and facilities. We loved the food at the Senate Club and made friends with the staff there. Everybody at the reception was first-class. We loved our room and do not hesitate to recommend the Claridge. 
the claridges ,"Oasis away from hectic Delhi We stayed in 3 hotels and this one was by far the best one ! It felt like a real oasis once coming out of the very busy Delhi.Not cheap, we know, but worth it !The restaurants were very good (Sevilla a bit pricy but the location makes up for it) and we enjoyed cooling down at the Claridges after our hectic days in Delhi. Minus point : taxis. Drivers are not very reliable and they tend to cheat on customers. But yes, that's very common in Delhi. But luckily we found a company with drivers that were &quot;safe&quot; and who didn't hassle us at all. So with those &quot;safe&quot; taxirides we felt a lot more at ease. "
the claridges ,"excellent hotel for first night in india This was an ideal first night for the triangle tour we spent 2 days here and could not fault the rooms service or food.Room service was very efficient and the staff were all very pleasant. We spent our last night of the tour here in the club delux rooms fantastic breakfast served in private dining room very quiet and relaxing other hotels would do well to copy this idea. The only disappointment was the lack of an indoor pool and games room, but well done Claridges good value . "
the claridges ,"excellent value for money. This hotel is excellent value for money. The room was very large with a large balcony, complete with table &amp; chairs overlooking the side street. The hotel has a colonial feel and the staff are all friendly &amp; helpful. There is a large lawned area at the front where guests can sit at tables sipping tea &amp; watching the comings &amp; goings of other guests! The hotel is a little out of the way with no amenities within near walking distance but taxis can be quickly summoned by the doorman. "
the claridges ,"Great hotel I stayed here with a colleague at the beginning and end of our trip to India. I'm not sure I could really find fault with the hotel. The staff are friendly and efficient, the rooms are very clean and well stocked with little luxuries, and the food is good too. It's not quite as close to the centre of Delhi as the Imperial and not quite as grand, but I'd happily stay again. "
the claridges ,Loved it We had 2 rooms booked and were very happy with them both. Family of 5. The decor is excellent and there is a lot of attention to details given in the rooms.Staff were attentive and polite.Will be going back there the next time we are in Dehli. 
the claridges ,"We will be going back! We are expats who travel from one part of India to Delhi regularly. We bring our little girl during our travels to Delhi so accommodation has to be close to home comfort as well as the feeling being spoilt. The Claridges gives us both. We have always liked boutique hotels no matter where we are around the world. The staff here is just amazing - very polite, accommodating and not -in-your-face. The whole hotel is very pleasant. We enjoy taking my little girl for a walk around the pool and the gardens, and every once in a while I feel like I am living in my very own mansion. We love the marquee on the front lawn - where we sit around and enjoy the lovely Delhi. The location is really central and we enjoy being accessible to many sites. "
the claridges ,"Not bad but not the best We (two couples) stayed here for our last night of a two week tour (basically the &quot;golden triangle&quot;). The hotel is in a peaceful , green and low density part of New Delhi - but fairly central. The check in was pleasant and efficient and our room much larger than expected and well equipped (TV, mini bar, bathroom) but surprisingly empty of furniture (bed, two chairs I think and that was about it). And, yes, we too had the &quot;cat's urine&quot; smell to contend with in the room (probably an ammonia-based cleaning product). I have experienced this before (in Puerto Rico) and the smell went after a few hours, but it wasn't great. We sat around the pool in the enclosed courtyard and were rather disappointed both by the time it took for tea to be ordered and arrive and by the somewhat surly refusal to serve beer &quot;outdoors&quot; (neither pool side nor on the front lawn). This was in stark contrast to The Park hotel a mile or so away where we stayed at the start of our holiday. There the pool side service was very rapid, very pleasant and without restriction. It seems that Claridges is subject to a local bye-law - but if The Park isn't bothered, why are they? On the plus side, the highlight of this hotel for us was Dharba, a mock-up of a truck drivers' road-side restaurant, with excellent food, very friendly (and humorous) staff and very reasonable prices. It was packed out the first night and almost as full the next - so book! The comparison with the appalling Bukhara restaurant (at the Sheraton) which we foolishly went to two weeks previously was extraordinary. At Dharba we paid something like 25% of the Bukhara's outrageous bill, for better food, much more efficient and friendly service and even got a knife and fork each (fingers are the rule at Bukhara!) We had to linger at the hotel after check out - until 11 pm - because our flight home was in the early hours. The hotel kindly allowed us to stay in the rooms till 2.30 pm without charge (we then went sight-seeing again). They also arranged two good modern cars to take us to the airport; without charging excessively. So, all in all, this was not quite as good as The Park but not a bad experience - and the Dharba takes some beating! "
the claridges ,"Beats Le Meridien hands down! We were meant to be starting and ending our honeymoon in India at Le Meridien-New Delhi but had to stay in The Claridges for the first couple of nights instead. We loved it straight away and didn't realise how spoilt we would be until we ended up in Le Meridien ten days later.The service in The Claridges was simply sensational as was the food. The staff were not surly as in Le Meridien but very friendly and professional. When looking for the beauty parlour, my wife was taken by a restaurant manager (of the Jade Garden, which I found to be excellent in spite of my not liking Chinese food) all the way to the other side of the hotel - this being in the middle of dinner service. We also had the best cocktails ever in the bar, where we were entertained by a thoroughly nice and very friendly barman. My wife said that their own &quot;Sip and Swing&quot; cocktail was the best she had ever had and I must admit I thought it was up there too. He even went to the trouble to arrange a table for us in one of their busy restaurants as we had forgotten to do this beforehand.The food in the hotel was far superior to anything in Le Meridien - Dhaba was brilliant, especially when compared to the Pakwan restaurant in the latter but also because not only were the staff so very nice on a busy night, the food was out of this world. I can also recommend the Dal Makhani in the Pickwicks restaurant.All-in-all, we wish we could have stayed here longer and definitely not in Le Meridien. The service there was disgusting and give me the 1930s-style elegance and far superior service of The Claridges over the really trendy but ultimately nothingness of Le Meridien anytime! "
the claridges ,"An Oasis in Hectic Delhi Claridges Hotel was a standout on a recent trip to Delhi. The hotel is in a beautiful residential area of New Delhi and is a modern hotel that recalls the glory days of the British Empire. Definitely a perfect location for an Agatha Christie mystery. This is a small hotel with a large garden and seems to be overstaffed, so service is excellent. Don’t be surprised that many of the staff know you by name. The tour desk can be contacted by email prior to arriving and all travel/touring arrangements can be made for the duration of a stay. Our budget room, booked through Asiarooms.com, was well-decorated and the size of a good-sized ship’s cabin. However, other rooms were quite large. There are several restaurants, but we only had time and energy to eat at the grill for breakfast and dinner, which was ala carte or buffet. Free wireless internet is available in the rooms and throughout the hotel.In and around Delhi, the pace is quite hectic so after a long day it is refreshing to find the calm and restful atmosphere at Claridges. This hotel proved to be an excellent choice both in price, comfort and amenities. "
the claridges ,"great stay We spent our first two nights here of a 21 day India trip. We had booked a superior room, but were upgraded to a suite, although I am pretty sure the hotel was not fully booked. This is great service, that we much appreciated. "
the claridges ,"Overpriced but good restaurant and bar After staying at sub-par properties and viewing some downright disgusting hotels in India, we chose the Claridges as our last hotel in India. The room was clean and comfortable, the interior of the hotel is lovely and has character, but it could use some updating on the outside. That said, the Spanish restaurant was very good and the hotel bar was quite nice. We left paying US$400 for one night, a dinner and drinks for what I would consider a four star hotel. In India, apparently, this is a good value. "
the claridges ,"Three Rooms three different stars We stayed here on a group tour this Sept. the first night our room was fabulous, the second night when we returned it was awful and smelled of cat urine and was much smaller, the third and final night of return, it was small but musty. I will say there breakfast and service was great. We ate in the Jade room on our final night and had a wonderful meal. They were great about exchanging different currency and making change. "
the claridges ,"Mismanaged and needs rehab I stayed one night in july. 2007 and four nights in august .2007. Both times, they gave me spacious rooms, 111 and 008, American second floor and first floor. The first time, i went in late. The room was very much OK., but next morning after showering, the bath room was, large though, overflowed with water from the shower, handheld spray and tub. It was awful. The same problem persisted in 008. I drew this to the attention of the management. They did some minor fixing like two bath curtains, loosened some diverter, etc. But the problem persisted and the last day, i took a meager wash. Room 008 is next to a parking lot and i could not open my drapes throughout to protect privacy. There were two half inch size flying insects one night. 111 had a fruit basket, but 008 had none. The hotel has a tendency to bill you high. The taxi from the hotel was four times more expensive than the local taxi. Forget the laundry, the price was higher than prices in USA.. Special restaurants like Sevilla were not attractive but pricey for no reason. The only one i ate was in their coffee shop, Pickwick, the canaloni was not consistent between white sauce and red sauce, but not bad. If you go to the Claridge, ask for Sankar rooms, 111 (and 008) or similar rooms. At least they are spacious and some are not next to parking lots and hopefully no overflowing bathrooms.. The hotel is intended for Americans who do not know there are forty rupees to the dollar. Siva Sankar, (fifty four year US citizen from US gold coast Nassau county, NY) "
the claridges ,A very pleasant hotel 6 of us traveled to India in January. Our first hotel was the Claridges. Our room was very pleasant and the location worked well for us. The highlight was the hotel restaurant Dhaba. And the bakery was quite good as well. 
the claridges ,Oh dear! Not going back. Having had a wonderful and spoiling holiday all round India it was very sad to end up here for two nights. We arrived late and one room was OK but the other one smelt too terrible and was not the suite we had been promised. After a long time they offered to change it - like a similar reviewer it was another ground floor room near the booming DJ down the marble passage. None of the Indian charm or service that we had been given elsewhere was visible. Not a good place to start or end a holiday. 
the claridges ,"Food poisoning plus other problems. Buyer beware! To begin with...a number of problems that other reviewers have already noted:- the swimming pool and sorrounding area does not seem to have been updated since the 1950s, or thereabouts- I was initially given a room that looked on to a wall a few feet away, despite prior assurances via email that an internet booking did not mean getting the leftover rooms no one else wanted.- the room rate was very high relative to quality of amenities, and inferior to what other similarly priced hotels can offer in Asia (e.g Four Seasons). And to make matters worse, tax was charged on the rack rate, not the actual room rate I was paying (this was explained as government policy, which it may be).Now the more important stuff...The main problem was the food. On day three evening I was struck down by acute nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, profuse sweating followed by cold shivers. Please note that I had not eaten anywhere outside the hotel since I had arrived from UK, so it could only be the hotel food. I should say that this was worst food poisoning I have ever had, I could not lift my head up from my knees for half an hour after the worst phase of diarrhoea. (I have travelled extensively in Africa and Asia, so my stomach has plenty of other experiences to compare this to). With some effort I was able to call a friend, and the hotel doctor (2 calls were needed before he arrived) and get some medicine to treat the problem. Although the worst was over by around midnight, the cramps continued through most of the night until whatever it was worked its way through my system. Two days later, when checking out (I only ate yogurt and bananas the rest of the time while I was there) I had to press the hotel management very forcefully (but politely) and publicly, in the lobby, to persuade them that they should reduce their charges in compensation for this painful experience. And I asked them to email me to let me know what steps they have since taken to make sure no other hotel visitors will go through the same experience in the future. They said they were already investigating the causes, and promised they would email when they had resolved the cause of the problem. But so far, three weeks later, I have yet to hear a word from them. I will be writing to them, to remind them of their promise "
the claridges ,"Did not like this hotel! Did not enjoy our stay in this hotel! It started while we were checking in: Internet booking clearly stated in writing that the rate of the room per day was 149:- USD per day, but they tried to charge 300:- USD per day! The pool was not as attractive as it could have been; art deco type of rooms might be fashionable in Delhi, but it is not the style we are looking for while staying in a hotel. All together: not impossible place to stay, but definitely not a place where I would stay again! "
the claridges ,"GREAT PLACE TO STAY Am i glad that i decided to stay in a hotel that is safe, central and good in all respects.the service is amongst the best i have experienced, staff is polite and helpful - nothing is too much. Their new restaurant, Saveilla, is to die for. the food is out of this world (book well in advance). the hotel is partty refurbished, a few dollars more is well worth it as they have all the great features.The breakfast at the senate (only for new club rooms) is superlative. We were there for 5 days and really enjoyed it. "
the claridges ,"A nightclub not a hotel Any hotel review in New Delhi should be prefaced with the caveat that &quot;India Rising&quot; has prompted a flood of business visitors into the Indian capital from all over the world. As a result, when it comes to quality hotel rooms it is a seller's market. Thus visitors should have no illusions that a $500/night room will get them value you'd find at a Four Seasons, Shangri-La or any other top tier Asian facility.When it comes to The Claridges potential lodgers should be aware that the hotel was recently sold (locals tell me that the family which sold it had been feuding and the place was allowed to deteriorate). However, the new owners still have a long way to go to get this place up to acceptable standards. When making my reservation I specifically asked not to be located near the ground floor Aqua vodka bar which is infamous for its blaring house music into the wee hours. You guessed it -- I was booked onto the ground floor about half way down the corridor. The floor of the hallway is marble and the corridor is arched, thus forming a wonderful acoustic amplifier. If you and a friend want to hold a conversation at opposite ends of the hallway, you will have no problem. If it's past midnight and you are trying to sleep ahead of an important morning business meeting then you will be miserable. The bass from the music can be clearly heard and inebriated patrons outside the door to Aqua or in the lobby will be audible inside your room. Yes, I did complain several times, but to little avail. Bluntly, the owners need to decide if they want to run a hip nightclub or an acceptable hotel. Those who also find an internet connection a priority in their hotel will be disappointed. The hotel offers a pay-as-you-go wi-fi service that is unreliable. The hotel also charges an extortionist 875 rupees per day for a 24-hour-long connection. That's nearly $20! I don't think I've ever paid that much at any hotel in the world and is certainly beyond the pale for a hotel in India with a sporadic connectibility. An alternative is to hunt down a staff member to log you on to one of the three computers in the business center for which they will also charge you. Other concerns: the key card for the door seemed to de-magnetize every couple of days or so. Cigarette smoke and other undesirable odors from the room adjacent to mine wafted in through the vents. The toilet paper dispenser was situated behind the toilet lid meaning some tricky maneuvers to comfortably carry out operations. Stained carpet in the room. Towels and bedsheets that smelled of smoke or had stains. The morning tea at the breakfast buffet tastes more like coffee (pots obviously interchangeable, ask for your own pot of hot water and tea bags instead). After several days here, I remarked to colleagues that staying at The Claridges was a part-time job in itself. On the positive side: the food is good in the restaurants. Wait staff are polite and efficient except for the infrequent glitch in orders. There's a Sunday brunch served on the front lawn. Aqua has the best selection of vodkas in New Delhi which you'll be able to enjoy before the DJ arrives and blasts you out of the bar. The hotel is centrally located. I previously stayed at the nearby Taj Ambassador which had a lower rate (not sure if that's the case any longer) and would recommend that over The Claridges. Unless you are hostage to this hotel as part of a tour package or can secure a room elsewhere besides the ground floor, you will definitely desire to give this place a pass at all costs, especially at the rates they are quoting these days. "
the claridges ,great experiance i had checked into the hotel mid october for 3 nights and i must say that it was quite good experiance.The staff was really nice and helpful.the rooms were excellent and were much beter than the rooms at the Taj or the Oberoi. I guess since the renovation has been done on the rooms the hotel had done a fabulous job. I celebrated my birthday along with my wife at the heotel must i say without my giving any such hints they organised an excellent dinner for the both of us with a bottle of wine along with the staff and the general manager's compliments. Recommend all to visit atleat once. 
the claridges ,"best to avoid this hotel - go to Oberoi instead My husband and I would not recommend the Claridges hotel. We stayed there for 3 nights (because we got a good deal), but it was not worth it. The front desk staff will try and scam you into upgrading your room and paying more in the luxury tax (12.5%). They overcharged us when we checked out by lying and saying the rack rate had changed for the whole hotel on our last night. It was extremely unprofessional and frustrating.Other negatives: the breakfast is not that good, the pool is dirty and not chlorinated (we were really disappointed about not being able to swim), the gym is small. We needed to call a particular cab company and the hotel kept trying to make us take one of the taxis that is based at their hotel.Some positives: our room was very large and clean, the Jade restaurant was just lovely.If you decide to stay at The Claridges, please be prepared to put up a fight and expect to be taken advantage of. We spent our last two nights in Delhi at the Oberoi Hotel (on golf course) and even though it cost a bit more, it is in a totally superior class. Everything was up front and absolutely perfect. We highly recommend booking here instead! "
the claridges ,"Claridges - staff excellent treat you like a Viscount Stayed in The Claridges for 4 days. Excellent in every way; attentive friendly staff, scrupulously clean, excellent restaurant choices (Italian, Indian, Chinese ), trendy Vodka Bar ( especially on Wednesday and Friday). Taxi service was inexpensive and prompt, notwithstanding the infamous Delhi traffic. UN personnel guests brought added security checks, but it will be my home from home on future trips. "
the claridges ,"What a disappointment Visiting India last week-we chose to stay for the first 2 days-and final day at The Claridges Hotel in New Delhi-primarily due to the location being central and their ability to provide 3 seperate beds in a room. Although the room was small -for the first 2 days-it was adequate-and we were told upon our departure that we could repeat this set up after our tour.. Upon arriving back after a long and tiring journey from Agra-we were informed that they only had the club room available-at a much higher rate. We were so tired that we had no choice but to accept this. Now read the following: Blood on the bedsheets, a shower that leaked so badly in the bathroom we had to use 6 towels to cover the floor so we didn't slip over (which they promised to replace but didn't), mould and damp on the walls-and the extra bed turned up at 11.30pm in the form of a badly damaged and dirty matress thrown onto the floor by 2 very rude staff members. Other highlights of the stay were 3 seperate occasions of being shortchanged by lobby staff when changing currencies (not by a few pounds either), completely wrong breakfast being delivered, damaged garden furniture with nails sticking out that ripped my friends trousers, rancid butter...oh what a wonderful 5 star experience. If you pay for what you get-we were seriously overcharged. I have stayed in modest guest houses in some of the poorest parts of Sri Lanka and have been delighted with the atmosphere, cleanliness, honesty and hospitality of these places-to these I shall recommend others and return myself....as for The Claridges my advice is simple: Avoid it-I shall!! "
the claridges ,"Good Hotel let down by pool area Spent 2 nights here having completed a 6 day tour round the area. The service from staff was the best on our whole 3 week holiday.Other reviews have mentioned the rooms and renovations taking place. The rooms were good, but out of the whole lot, only 8 face the pool area. I think as tourists we wanted to unwind around the pool having spent the previous days rushing round Rajastan. This part of the hotel wasn't 5 star and really needs sorting out. Having said that, I got the impression that's lots of it's guests are business people or Indian families, so gathering around the pool isn't as important as to themTry not to use the phone in the room either. I spotted a fraudulent transaction on my account and had to phone the bank straight away. I was charged £77 for a 24 minute phone call. So if you need to phone home, get a phone card!! "
the claridges ,World Class I recently spent several nights at the Claridges. The service is extraordinary and every employee is friendly and eager to be helpful. The hotel -- recently renovated -- is gorgeous and the location is great. Our meals at the restaurant hotels were first class and we got a great rate on the internet. Highly recommended! 
the claridges ,"Great value for money! The Claridges was a change from most hotels in the region. The rooms are large, cellings are high and amenities are morden and the most enjoyable thing is the natural light!!! We stayed for 4 days, whilst i was busy with business, my wife made the most of staying in heart of Delhi. The staff was friendly and helpful. "
the claridges ,"Terrible!!!!!!! Although the 75% that has been refurbished is very nice indeed if like me you were stuck in the 25% that had not, expect to pay $225 for a large room with stained carpets, sofa and walls; a bathroom with cracked tiles and bath; half eaten trays of food left on the ripped carpeted corridor floor leading to your room and a very noisy air conditioner. On the plus side, they make very nice ice-cream coffee in the coffee shop. I appreciate that they are half way through updating but to continue to place people in these rooms and call themselves a 3-star hotel is a joke! "
the claridges ,"Not up to scratch for it's rating We did not expect Claridges to be up to the standard of the Imperial and we were not wrong. The hotel was still undergoing some renovation work and we found ourselves awake most of the night listening to furniture and equipment being dragged around the room above ours, despite repeated calls to reception and a 1am visit from an in effectual duty manager, who at first denied any work was going on, until we were all nearly overcome with paint fumes!The themed hotel restaurant was suposed to resemble a roadhouse. The food was bland and the atmosphere phoney. Our bedroom was ok but the curtain was hanging off and the bathroom was too small. One to avoid!! "
the claridges ,"Poor just poor! The reception manager was really rude too! I have re-read the reviews of this hotel - just in case I was misjudging this hotel unfairly. But no. My view, shared by many it seems, is that this hotel is hardly a 3 star. The main reception has been smartly redeveloped, but the rooms (which afterall are important, when all you really want is a comfortable, clean and secure facility for sleeping) supported by helpful staff and decent food too.But the reality of the Claridges is poor quality furniture - no hot water ever! Cramped small rooms which are overpriced and a restaurant that is bleak and lacking in any charm.However, what really differentiates this hotel is the really appalling response from the management when you had a serious problem - as regrettably we did. When we returned from a lovely dinner at the Imperial (not as expensive as some people would have you believe - and fab food/setting too) - we were shocked to find that some medicaton had been removed from our bedroom at the Claridges. I called the front desk and asked whether someone could possibly have accidentally removed them in error. The front desk / duty manager was disinterested and suggested that we might have lost the tablets ourselves. We rechecked and rechecked and could tell that our medicines had been removed (stolen, to be more precise). This is a very serious accusation to make, and not one that I make lightly.I asked to speak to the manager - this was now nearly two hours later and the hotel still had not done anything to try to address the problem. They refused to get the manager. The duty manager was hostile and aggressive.I asked for the police phone number as I now wished to report this to the police. He again refused. I asked several times and eventually managed to get the phone number myself and proceeded to report the theft personally.The police arrived and were very helpful. I was told there had been similar problems at this hotel, although could not confirm this myself. It was only through the insistence of the Police Chief that the hotel agreed to conduct an invesitgation and arrange for the tablets to be replaced.Three hours later (now the middle of the night) the hotel phoned me in my room (and woke me up) to tell me I could come to the front desk and collect replacement tablets. Unbelieveable.Still unbelieveable was that I went to the front desk - only to find that they had got the wrong medication.I ended my stay at this hotel several days early - and checked out of this hotel the next morning - in part because of the theft - but mainly because of the attitude of the Duty Manager.I should like to thank the police who were friendly, helpful and reassuring at all times. The hotel management should however be viewed with great suspicion. I would not recommend this hotel. "
the claridges ,"Okay for weary travellors Although I was underwhelmed by the 70s facade and dreary designer-imitation lobby, the room was spacious and the bed an absolutely comfortable highlight. Our room didn't have a pool or garden view. We looked onto a parking lot. But to make up for it, we had 2 super size plasma televisions. I guess that cheered us up a bit. There was a bad smell in the room. My boyfriend thought it was from the teak floors - maybe the polish or something? It was pretty nasty.The bathroom was marble. Okay except that it didn't have a bath, and the hot water never ran hot or even very warm, despite many demands. The restaurant Corbett's was kind of fun and delicious. I did enjoy that. But the breakfast restaurant was just adequate. Overall, Delhi's not the greatest place anyway. If you've just gotten off a 20 hour flight from North America and you want somewhere to get over your jetlag for two nights, this is an okay choice. "
the claridges ,"here right now and not impressed mmm Claridges...delusions of grandeur/identitiy crisis. NOthing special compared to many other top Indian hotels. Looking tatty in some areas. If they are doing some renovations fine, but there's no signage to indicate this. Over jealous staff lining up but that's normal I think!Had to move rooms as despite their promotional material stating that all guest rooms have a garden or pool view this is not the case. The solution they clean the marble floor with stinks pretty bad and has a nasty lingering latrine smell. I can also hear taps running and toilets flushing through the air con system.maybe I've been spoilt in other hotels..! "
the claridges ,"Nice hotel but a few problems I spent 3 days at the Claridges in late Feb/early March '06. It's an older hotel that is undergoing renovation. I had a renovated room complete with plasma TV and electronically controlled lighting and drapes. The bathroom had a nice marble shower, and the entire room showed very nicely. While it showed nicely, not everything worked properly. Channels on the TV had to be switched manually, I think because no one could figure out how to program the remote. The shower door leaked and water flowed freely onto the floor. The air conditioning vent had very wide slots and flies constantly came through. Lastly, they use a ghastly cleaning fluid on the marble floors that leaves a terrible odor.The hotel has several restaurants and all are good, especially the chinese. Service is prompt and very friendly. Like other nice hotels in India, the staff tries almost a little too hard, and you are constantly saying no thank-you. There is a nice lawn with umbrella tables out front. Great place for a cigar and drink this time of year. If not for the odor, I'd give the hotel a third star. "

the connaught ,"Central Business District of New Delhi Well located in Connaught Place also known as the Central Business District of New Delhi, The Connaught hotel, a First Class, 4 Star First Class hotel in New Delhi, is suitable for the discerning business Traveller as well as the tourists. The hotel is in the vicinity of New Delhi Railway Station and also well connected to the International and Domestic airports. "
the connaught ,"Best not to stay Tiny rooms, arrogant staff and an average breakfast. Rooms have no character, everything is just moderate. "
the connaught ,"A nice hotel in the middle of everything After three nights in two star hotels, I was relieved to stay here. It is way above two/three star but definitely not 5 star. However, it felt like a 5 star by comparison! Room was spacious, modern and had all the amenities I could want. Very nicely decorated, fruit basket, cookies, and water bottle daily. Hotel staff very gracious and helpful with all my requests, including a late checkout because I had an 11:30 p.m. flight. They arranged for car/driver for sightseeing at very reasonable rates (INR $800 for the day!) It is set back off the street giving it a classy and safe feel which was important as a single female traveller. I would definitely recommend it. I booked it through an online reservation site, way below rack rate. "
the connaught ,"Average clean hotel We had a suite, were wecomed with cookies and a fruit basket, and enjoyed the spaciousness. We had numerous breakfasts, lunches and a memorable dinner with traditional Indian music. At the end we had a problem because our checkout time was noon and we didn't get picked up for the airport until 9:00 p.m. We tried to arrange for more time, but a seedly little man with bottle-bottom glasses told us that we would have to pay $220 for the extra time, and when we didn't like that, he tried to negotiate and asked &quot;What would you be willing to pay?&quot; At that point, we decided it was time to get out. "
the connaught ,"Well located ! I stayed for 12 days at this property, right in the heart of New Delhi and had a comfortable stay. It is 300m behind Regal Cinema and iseasily approachable. Hardly one hrs drive from the airport, it is just 5min drive to the New delhi railway station.Connaught Place is full of restaturants and food outlets and most are in the vicinity of this hotel.The rooms are well furnished and the bathroom accessories are of modern touch. The AC is centrally controlled and is quite effective. The hotel has excellent staff who are avaiable on call.The erstaurant food is not great and is okay for a meal or two but not for a stay of 10 - 12 days.Overall, a good experince for a business trip. "
the connaught ,"An average place An average hotel. Everything is lukewarm about the hotel. From the welcome at the reception to the rooms to the restaurant, there is nothing to rave about. First at the check in, they try to be as classy as possible but one can easily see that its missing. You know they are making an effort but you know its not coming naturally. Then the rooms - the room which I stayed at provided a view of the hockey stadium besides it. It was green but not exactly the green I was looking for. the good part was that there was no disturbance in the view due to the stadium. The size of the room seemed a bit small than other hotel rooms and seemed like as if the bed was touching all the four walls. The bedsheets and towels were clean and the bed was well laid out. Atleast that was one area I could not complain. Room service was good. Though the food served was average. I had visited the restaurant downstairs but again the fare was average. The breakfast served in the morning was continental and the spread was good. So one had some choice. All in all, its much cheaper than a five star and situated in a nice place in delhi as well as it is centrally located. Connaught place is also a nice place to take a stroll in the evening. "
the connaught ,"Economical option in the centre of the city I visit New Delhi quite often for work. Whenever mhy work needs me to be near the city office. This one of the economical options there.Some parts of the hotel seems to be stuck in the mid 80s. But the staff is very warm and cheerful. They have refurnished some of the rooms, these rooms are pretty nice for the money that is paid. The older part is a bit below the mark.The bathrooms are pretty small and not for the claustophobics. The toiletries provided are not of very high quality, recomend that travellers take their own.Earlier it used to overlook the Shivaji Hockey stadium, which was a good sight to wake up to. But now it is all been demolished for a Metro Station, not sure if one will get as much sunlight once that is constructed. The hotel offers a fruit basket which is very good though. The breakfast is pretty functional though. Their Restaurant where the breakfast buffet is provided could do with some urgent renovation though.Overall stay in this hotel if you have very functional requirements and the expectation is low. "
the connaught ,Liked the welcome cookies and fruits Nice and cleanly maintained rooms; breakfast has variety; nice to see welcome cookies and fruits as you check in; however over priced; lower rent would attract more traffic 
the connaught ,Okay experience The rooms are well furnished. Some of them offer a great view of the stadia next door. The hotel has good service but late night orders are sometimes delayed beyond reasonable time.Room decor is appreciable though layout could be improved upon.The location of the hotel is quite an advantage and the rack rates are pretty competitive.The front office service could be improved upon sometimes the checking out process can be quite time consuming.Overall a good hotel and staying could be a pretty good experience. 
the connaught ,An ok hotel for the budget traveller cant complain much as it is like a typical 3/4 star hotel. Dont expect much from service but is ok when the budget is limited. didnt try the food during my stay. 
the connaught ,"WONDERFUL STAY The Connaught is a wonderful hotel, conviniently located &amp; suberb staff. I have stayed for 03 nights and enjoyed them all. Room was quite good with excellent view of city. Basket of fruits &amp; biscuits is good gesture by hotel. Eating in tea lounge is very enjoyable, cakes &amp; pastries displayed are fabulous. Tried room service for dinner, food was good. Live breakfast is good to see &amp; encourages you to eat. Bar is quitely located with light music.We also had a joyride on Delhi Metro as station is very near to hotel.Overall enjoyed stay &amp; would again like to come to The Connaught when we visit India in future. "
the connaught ,Excellent Stay Hotel is in hub of city but still peaceful and with much wanted greenery. Staff very courteous. Cleanliness very good. No need to spend for going to shops as we can walk to connaught place. Stayed for 02 nights and will try to come again. 
the connaught ,"Very pleasant stay We were in room no. 404. we had very comfortable stay,breakfast was lavish,staff very cooperative, enjoyed shopping in connaught place as we could reach by foot. "
the connaught ,"Don't stay at the Connaught if you can avoid it Room modern, clean and ok.Desk staff not very helpful.Very expensive (although we didn't pay directly)Foyer furniture very dirty. "
the connaught ,"The Connaught was a pleasant surprise The Connaught Hotel far exceeded our expectations as we had read too many negative reports on this site. Our airline and agent both recommended this hotel and we are so glad we took their advice. Due to last minute changes of our ETA, a hotel driver was still there to greet us at Delhi airport when we landed at 2.30 am. Reception staff warmly greeted us that morning and ever after as we stayed 7 nights. Twice, the excellent Bowhani Junction restaurant was opened for us for breakfast at 4.30 am to meet early pickups. Each morning and evening saw us dining from an excellent menu, with delightful table service and live Indian music was performed 2 nights per week. The room was clean, adequate and fresh fruit and cookies were replaced each day to accompany the tea making facilities. Fresh flowers decorated our room and glorious gladioli displays in the bright clean lobby area were changed almost daily. The central position in New Delhi makes the hotel easily accessible. Even more so, when the new Metro station next door opens for the Commonwealth Games 2010. We will definitely return to the Connaught to stay next time. "
the connaught ,"Disgraceful This hotel was the last place we stayed during an 18 day trip in India and Nepal and was booked through Max Holidays India-a customized trip for me and my wife.The entire trip up until our stay here was wonderful but this hotel was a disgrace. There was mold in the bathroom, the bedding was moist from? mildew and the place smelled and was filthy-the room, restaurant, hall carpets, etc. My wife and I have traveled extensively all over the world the last 2 years and this was by far the worst experience. If I could rate it worst than terrible I would. Don't even consider staying here. To &quot;add insult to injury&quot;, they apparently charged $255 for the night's stay-disgraceful.Tom Linkous,Scottsdale,Arizona,USA "
the connaught ,"Lousiest Service Ever Completely untrained staff. Our list of complaints was much longer, but here are the memorable highlights:(1) They wake you up at 7 AM to ask you if you'd like to use the laundry service(2) They dis-regard the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on your door (3) The housekeeping staff can wake the dead with their ruckus while they clean other rooms around yours. Doesn't help that the walls and doors are paper-thin. (4) All in all, God help you if you're trying to sleep in.(5) The breakfast is terrible and the waiters are sullen and can't be bothered to bring you anything.I've had better service in rat traps in Paris. "
the connaught ,"Rats We have just returned home from what was a fantastic tour of Amritsar,Daramshala and Shimla - only to have the whole experience spoiled by our Connaught experience. When we went to bed we could hear a scrabbling noise coming from behind the fridge in our room. Maintenance were called and they had a look and said there were two rats there and they would put a &quot;gum board&quot; down and that would get rid of them! An hour later we called again and another man arrived and repeated the &quot;gum board&quot; treatment - it did work after another hour of us laying listening to the gnawing sound of these rats.At 3 a.m. it stopped and we could sleep - uneasily - before our long day and flight back to UK - never again will we stay there and this was on the 5th floor.We complained to the manager the next day and he offered to extend our stay in the room so we could catch up on some sleep! "
the connaught ,"Avoid... I don't know how some people can rate this property as reasonable...I wonder how many hotels they have experienced... This hotel is lousy. I stayed here in September last year and I still have vivid memories of how bad this was. The rooms are tiny, dark, dingy, smelly and way overpriced. There was nothing positive about this hotel...except the location. Suprisingly though there was a worse hotel to come during our trip (Mohan International in Amritsar...)As I was on a business trip with collegues we had to return to this hotel for a night after a visit to Agra &amp; Jaipur and this time we received a refurbished room which was only marginally better...For anyone contemplating this hotel - avoid. I am sure there are far better standard class hotels in Delhi than this... "
the connaught ,"Wouldn't recommend this hotel We stayed at this hotel as part of the Golden Triangle tour, I was a bit hesitant after reading so many negative reports on tripadvisor, but our tour operator changed our booking to this hotel at the last minute, stating the other hotel was too far out of central delhi for sightseeing. To be honest i wish he'd never chnged the booking,. the lobby is nice, airy and really inviting, the bedrooms tell a different story, we'd booked a triple room, and it was so small that the double bed took up most of the room, the camp bed they put in after 3 hours of waiting had virtually no chance. The bathroom was dingy and small. Towels and bed linen had seen better days, and i was reluctant to use them. The little &quot;bar Area&quot; in the lobby was ridiculous, it took 50 minutes for the waiter to bring us our order of 3 servings of cheese toast. Breakfast was okayish. I wouldn't stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone, it was double the price of the hotels we'd had in Jaipur and Agra but they were far far better in terms of quality of service, rooms and facilites.... "
the connaught ,"Fine for a short stay My husband and I stayed at the Connaught for 2 nights in March 2008. We were a little hesitant after reading some of the Trip Advisor reviews, but we thought the hotel was fine, especially as it was our first 2 days in India and we expected much worse!The room was clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The bathroom smelled a little musty but this didn't bother us too much. What did bother us was a phone outside our room which rang early in the morning every 10 minutes or so. I think reception use this to get staff to look over the rooms when guests check out. I appreciate this is necessary but we did find it annoying. We ate in the coffee shop on one of the nights. I stuck to vegetarian food, which was tasty, but my husband's chicken tasted a little off and he was ill later that night. I didn't feel that the hotel amenities were advertised well enough, for instance, we didn't realise there was a bar and restaurant on site. We wouldnt've gone to the coffee shop had we known!The hotel was fine for those wanting a short stay on a budget. "
the connaught ,"Perfectly adequate city hotel We stayed here for two nights in February. Our room was not that large but perfectly comfortable. Laundry was done in a day and returned without problem. Hotel is a typical city hotel, in a good central position. We ate in the restaurant the first night and it was fine. The second night we treated ourselves to dinner at The Imperial - an amazing luxury hotel a taxi-ride away. Breakfast was fine although the restaurant was very busy. We had a two night/one day stop in Delhi and this hotel was fine. Nothing spectacular but we were satisfied with the room and service. "
the connaught ,"Better than expected Some of the reviews by previous visitors worried me but our room was fine and more than adequate. The breakfast was fine (included) and the dinner we had there was very good. - They even had a small Indian musical group at dinner. I'd stay there again. Decorations and cleanliness were very good. It being the weddding season (Nov- Mar.) added to the festive atmosphere at the hotel. At least two receptions were held there. This hotel was selected by our tour company, Holidays to Treasure which provided us a very good private tour of Rajastan and the Golden Triangle. "
the connaught ,"Not Recommeded Dull, dingy and rude can best describe our 3 nights at The Connaught. The carpet in our room was very dirty, the towels and bed linens were old and dingy and the staff was rude. Even though we charged 15 minutes of internet use to our room and signed a slip for it, we were called repeatedly by the front desk and told we had a bill at the desk that had to be paid immediately. Others in our group were awakened at 11:00 p.m. at night to sign a slip for something they charged to their room. Pigeons started gathering on our window sill every morning at 4:30 a.m....leaving behind lots of their dirty work so we never opened the drapes. We would not recommend this hotel. "
the connaught ,"Dissapointing We recently stayed here during the 'cold wave'. The Hotel was freezing, no heating. Our room was really cold, especially the marble floor. The room was also very small, averagely clean but the double glazed window was very murky blocking out the view.Breakfast was the high point. The dining room was warm and the food was good.Service was good also. "
the connaught ,"disappointing We were disappointed with this hotel. Our room was musty, the carpet was dirty, the linen was a shade of grey and not white. The air conditioning was noisy and we felt like prisoners in our dark room as the only outside window was covered due I think to site works going on outside. I would rather have had the light and looked at the site works!After a word with our travel agent we did manage to get an upgrade which was more satisfactory.The restaurant was dark and dreary and the staff were not up to the standard we had experienced in other hotels we had stayed in. Our son was very ill after eating there on our last night in Delhi so maybe the restaurant needs to look at its hygiene practices. We had only eaten there that day - breakfast and dinner.Front desk was fine and processed our booking efficiently. The door greeters were most pleasant and helpful.However I would be reluctant to recommend this hotel to friends although the location is its saving grace. Really handy to good shops. "
the connaught ,"This Hotel is OK! I feel I must post a review as the reviews I have read about this hotel paint it as awful! I did not want to stay here &amp; had a running battle with our Indian travel agent, who insisted! We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our 2 1/2 week tour of North India &amp; were delighted when we finally opened the door to our room after our long plane trip to find a recently refurbished clean room with flat screen TV &amp; new airconditioning. Breakfast was great, the staff friendly &amp; overall a very good place to begin our tour. We arrived during Dewali festival &amp; our only complaint was the air quality. "
the connaught ,"Great cookies at the Connaught We were very apprehensive about this hotel after reading the reviews on this site. Although the rooms are quite small, the ensuite bathroom was clean and worked well . The fruit bowl and welcoming cookies were most appreciated as we arrived quite late and had not had a lot to eat plus the bottled water and the kettle for early morning tea or coffee. Our room overlooked the stadium and we found the activities interesting to watch. Our stay fell on a Sunday and it was easy and safe to walk the streets around the hotel.The breakfast buffet was excellent and the fresh omelette bar was quite funky but also produced a type of indian pancake too. We did try to stick to Indian food throughout our stay to minimise tummy troubles ...and were for the most part successful. "
the connaught ,"Tired and worn Myself and three friends stayed at the Connaught Hotel at the start and end of our two week trip to India. While the complimentary fruit, water and cookies were welcoming, the decor and fittings are very tired and dirty in places. The bathrooms are extremely small but reasonably well equipped. The breakfast buffet has a varied selection and omlettes cooked to order. Service is helpful. This is definitely not worth 4 stars but conveniently located. "
the connaught ,"Mid Level Hotel The Connaught is well located in central New Delhi and within walking distance to Connaught Place. The hotel has very small rooms but the rooms were fairly clean (carpet was spotted in places) and the air conditioning adequate. There was no internet access in the room but they did have dial up speed wireless internet in the lobby so bring your own laptop. The morning buffet breakfast was one of the best in all of India for variety, quantity, and quality.I rate this hotel 3 stars by US standards and fine for people who just want a place to sleep. Others have commented that some other rooms were not that clean so if you get a dirty room ask to be moved.Tip: Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view of the city. The hotel does not charge a fee to exchange money and the rate is fair. "
the connaught ,Good Central Hotel We stayed here for 2 nights. Our rooms had been updated and a good standard. They were rooms facing the road not hockey pitch. The location right next to Connaught Square was great. We were able to go out to local shops to get some good bargains.Looking at other reviews we were concerned at having to stay but overall thought it was a good hotel very close to what was going on. We would stay there again 
the connaught ,"I liked this hotel! We stayed at the Connaught at the end of our tour of Rajasthan. I don't quite understand the other negative comments here, as the hotel was perfectly pleasant!Our room wasn't big, but I've stayed in much smaller, and it was clean, modern and very comfortable. We had to phone reception to find out how to turn off the aircon, but then it was fine. The bathroom was a bit dated, but perfectly clean and pleasant. The bed was comfy. My only real negative would be that it wasn't very Indian, it could have been any city across the world. But I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for a decent, midrange hotel in Delhi. "
the connaught ,"Oh dear Where do I start...dingy dark dank...room upholstry and carpets dirty, furious air-con unable to disguise smell of damp.....maintenace work - loud constant banging necessitated a first room change... more to come later...a dark dingy restaurant that absolutely no-one seems to use except for breakfast, where there is no cold milk or at least there was, but waiter didnt want to have to go and fetch it! We had 3 nights at the start of our trip and one at the end, which after the first 3 nights I was not looking forward to...on arrival for out last night, we were given a double bed having asked for a twin, I insited on moving..moved to an &quot;upgrade&quot; with flourescent strip lighting that was either all on or all off..no bedside lights at all, ...and still a double bed! another furious room change, this time to the &quot;best &quot;suite in the hotel...still grubby and dingy..and with a loud whirring noise that &quot;maintainence&quot; were coming to sort out....still waiting at 2.30 a.m...they never arrived. ...mouldy baths, peeling paint, gloom and doom....one positive thing..the sheets were very clean! This hotel may function well as an Indian business hotel, but that is all. Staff demoralised and obviously used to complaints, no fault with the staff but with management and owner. Dont bother with this hotel...this is no 4 star but 2 at best. (P.S go to the Oberoi - as amazing as the Connaught is awful!) "
the connaught ,Beware of what you eat!! We stayed at the Connaught Hotel for two days before we travel the &quot;golden triangle&quot;. The bathroom had mold around the tub and the wiring for the hair dryer was down to the wires. They are also doing some work on the place. All day long there was hammering and pounding. The day we were to leave on the tour we had breakfast in the hotel. By noon I was so sick I could hardly stand. My hosband and I ate the same food except for the juice. So traveler beware. 
the connaught ,Not recommendable I stayed at the Connaught for 2 nights on a business trip. Small room with amazingly filthy carpet which forced me to sleep with my socks on. Bathroom was just acceptably clean.I was unable to look out of my window due to a sort of curtain hiding it from the outside (probably related to ongoing maintainance work) and felt like in a prison cell. Checkout procedure totally inefficient.Should be rated and priced 1 - 2 stars. 
the connaught ,"1 star at best How is Hotel can be a 4 star is beyond me. 1 star at best fits the dirty rooms, moudly bathrooms, terrible service from staff. How other people gave this hotel a good review is beyond me. Didn't we stay at the same place. I guess they must be used to sleeping on soiled bedding and moudly bathroom floors and tubs. "
the connaught ,"average hotel We spent 3 nights at this hotel, 2 nights at the start of the holiday and 1 at the end. We found the hotel average, the rooms were small but clean. Nothing to complain about but of all the hotels we stayed at during our holiday, it did have the best buffet breakfast. The best thing about the hotel is that it is within easy walking distance of Connaught Place, which is a great place to go shopping. "
the connaught ,"Needs alot of work The Connaught was likely quite nice in its time, but time has not been kind to this hotel.You can tell immediately that it is an old hotel, but the lobby gave a good first impression with a professionaly done fresh flower centerpiece and the staff in clean, pressed uniforms. The check in was quick and the bell boy efficient. The rooms are where the main problems lie. They are very old in both appearance and smell. We took two rooms and both were far from satisfactory. The air conditioning blows a musty smell and the walls are moldy. The room is fairly small and the carpet was filthy, as were the sheets on the bed. The bathroom was clean and the shower fine. They provided tea/coffee making facilities and one bottle of water complimentary. The service at the Connaught was generally good, although one of the front desk associates took 10 minutes to return our change, having to go back into the cash drawer three times and still returning the incorrect amount.This was our third hotel in a nine hotel trip through India and was the only one that we found to be unacceptable. The location is great, but not worth staying there. The upside is that they seem to be doing renovations. The down side is that they will have to tear down and rebuild most walls to get rid of the mold and likely won't do that. "
the connaught ,"Pretty Good I notice some mixed reviews here but our experience was pretty good i have to admit. We had no check in problems and our room was very neat and clean with not complaints (maybe a touch on the small side). I actually couldn't find anything to fault this place. Comparitively its probably a little pricey and i've noticed some massive fluctuations in room tarrif. Knowing India, if you've managed a cheaper tarrif they would almost certainly keep this in mind and give you a dodgeyer room and probably sneer here and there. I strugged to find them on the web and went through an agent. Their email is [---] in which is their owner body email address or phone [---]. I liked this place and would recommend it based on our experience. Its right in the middle of colaba which is the place to be but about 60-80 mins from the airport. When we asked someone to arrange a transfer for us it cost of about 1200Rs but we got a prepaid cab from the traffic police booth for 170Rs. You have to fight your way past all the scouts and cheats who will charge you about 500Rs but ask inside the terminal where the prepaid taxi stand is if you can't find it. mail me on scorpioscorpion@hotmail.com if you want to know anything else...have fun "
the connaught ,"The ""not posh"" Connaught The Connaught is to be avoided if you want rest at the end of a long day. We arrived late, very tired after a long train journey. Our room was very small, the carpet and soft furnishing soiled, however the sheets were clean and the bed OK. I must have been very tired because the bathroom look OK too. We went to sleep immediately. Imagine our surprise when on rising the next morning, found the tap was missing from the bath, it was rusted around the fitting, so had been like this for quite some time (sorry couldn't manage to post photo). The Manager was rung and we were moved to another room, this time with a tap over the bath. The carpet and soft furnishing in this room were also soiled and grubby. It is a big city hotel, however the staff were distant the foyer was also grubby, the furniture sticky as were the soft furnishings. We left a report for the Management. We are pleased to say that this was the only poor hotel on our 22day trip. All the other hotels were excellent and of course we have let our Travel Agent &amp; friends know about the Connaught. "
the connaught ,A decent 4 star hotel A good 4 star hotel.We had a room at the 4th floor. The view outside had a hockey ground.Rooms were clean and neat. But they were quiet small.However the restuarant is very slow to serve anything. It was rather frustrating as we had a train to catch. 
the connaught ,"Liked the Restaurant Arrived in the early hours of the morning as our first stop in India. Rooms were soon made ready for us, and were fine - basically what you would expect from a business focussed hotel, though not in the top category of business hotels. Staff were pleasant and helpful - arranged a visit for us with little notice. The breakfast was better than most we had in India, and the food at the restaurant was good and good value as well. The hotel was well located if you were familiar with Delhi, but a little daunting for a first time visitor exploring locally, especially taxi and tuc tuc drivers seeking trade when you ventured from the hotel. "
the connaught ,"One to be avoided This hotel is not a good welcome to Delhi or India. Our room was on the 6th floor and was small and dirty. I hate to think what was living in the carpet and the valance was stained. It is very dated and in desparate need of refurbishment and a good clean. We were due to return to this hotel at the end of our tour but asked our travel company to check us in to a different hotel. It is supposed to be a 4 star, but in our view it definitely isn't. "
the connaught ,"Dumpsville I ended up there for 1 night on business, so not my choice, or money. The company paid usd $165/night, which has to be the worst value for money in the whole of Asia. To be fair, Delhi is expensive for hotels and getting more so (think $250+ for 4* in the busy season), but even so.I chatted to an Aussie couple who had paid $85, but even at that price I wouldn't stay there again. Maybe $50 if i was paying out of my own pocket, but that's about it.The place had a rundown feel to it, very scruffy in general and shabby rooms. The bar had the ambience of a Mcdonalds and they hadn't even bothered to clean the tables. Only plus point is the central location, but the immediate area is a dump. The staff were pretty good too. "
the connaught ,"Soft Surfaces need Cleaning Too. I was booked into the Connaught Hotel in New Delhi by a tour company. I was told it rated 4 star. Definately NOT!Location was &quot;God knows&quot; where. I looked out my room window and there was a double window scill easily a couple of inches deep in pigeion crap. Pigions were running up and down and very noisy. Across the road a depressing slum. Not a pretty picture.All hard surfaces in the hotel were clean and sparkling. i.e. marble floors, glass, wood, tiles etc. All soft surfaces in the hotel i.e. carpets, upholstery, draparies were amazinging ignored and filthly. The carpet in my room was so dirty and stained that I slept with my sox on in case I had to get up at night. No way was I putting my bare feet on that carpet.The Lobby has great furniture but the fabric is all black where ever people put there harnds...a lot of greasy hands touched this stuff. The attractive draperies were just plain dirty. Cleaning should be day to day maintenace.Even with everything clean it will only rate 3 stars max. The hotel dosn't seem to be near anything and the most disturbing, I was being told I could go out alone on the street.I booked a hotel not a jail cell. Get cleaning guys and talk to the neighbourhood. "
the connaught ,"We have buffet breakfast! This was our first Indian Experience. After the rush and smell (smoky) of our drive at night from Delhi Airport we were greeted warmly at this hotel. On the way up to our room the porter very proudly announced that they had a &quot;buffet breakfast&quot;. Our hotel had been downgraded at my husbands request to reflect a more Indian Hotel. This we found out later was where Indian businessmen and families stayed. Less touristy, although of course there were still plenty of tourists. It was pleasant enough and the breakfast was good although a little crowded when everyone tries to have breakfast at the same time. Central location, easy walking distance to Janpath. The staff were fine although they did hover a little for tips. This was to be expected as they probably were paid less than in some other hotels. "

the florence inn ,"Bad Area Not that great location &amp; hotel, just hyped room without window and noisy as on the street. "
the florence inn ,"Good hotel great location but very small rooms We stayed at the Florence inn for 2 nights. One of the USP of the hotel is, its situated bang on Karol Baug a very busy shopping street. The room that we had was a 'Deluxe room' which according to the front desk is the 'Standard room' of the hotel. On getting inside the room what struck me was it was the smallest hotel room, I had ever visited. It was square room with the bed in the middle and only 1 person could walk at a time in the room. Also the room had no windows, which I felt was rather strange. The food at the restaurant was good but the restaurant staff were not so polite in their manners. "
the florence inn ,"Exceeded our expectations We booked our stay after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com.The Hotel has a wonderful website which enabled us to book online on their online booking system and we got cheaper rates, we wanted to make sure that we get a confirmed reservation to avoid last minute surprises. Communicated by email regarding the Airport pickup before my arrival and all emails were replied to and the best part was I got the Hotel booking confirmation within 05 minutes of my booking with the online system. Driver met me at the airport as promised.This being our first trip to India. We were rather apprehensive about staying in a non 5 hotel, 10 min outside the centre of Delhi. However we took the risk and we were glad of doing so. Florence Inn was great, excellent value for money. The rooms were clean, the beds very comfortable, the service was courteous and friendly. The food at the lobby level restaurant was superb in fact it rates amongst the best meals we had on the whole trip. Florence Inn is close to the Metro which is safe and easy to use. We did do a bit of local shopping.Staff were super friendly, spoke good English, and room/bathroom were spacious and clean. Wi Fi internet was available on each floor. Over all the FLORENCE INN was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel, to families as well as to single travelers or couples. "
the florence inn ,"Highly Recommended !!! Quiet location in the middle of everything in Delhi. Great staff and excellent management .We were a group of 23 people from different parts of world, came to attend a workshop in Delhi. We were quite lucky to find Florence Inn. Full credit goes to our ground staff from dehradun and Mr. Jaydeep the GM of the property for making our event a memorable one. Service, meals, cleanliness, and quality of rooms were impressive. The Conference rooms are spacious and well suited for a get together or a conference.It is a very professionally managed hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is open round the clock, buffet breakfast is good and safe. The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station, which is a great boon getting around Delhi. "
the florence inn ,"Satisfactory place I recently styaed at the Florence Inn for a total of 4 nights. On the whole I do not have any serious complaints or concerns about the place. By mistake i'd booked into Florence Hotel rather than Florence Inn. Judging by other reviews on this sight Florence Hotel does not appear to have as many favourable reviews as Florence Inn. However after a few emails they quickly changed the reservation at no expense or fuss.The hotel itself is conveniently located on a side street with the metro stop only a couple minutes walk away. There a a couple of decent restaurants just off the main drag (Punjab Corner and Suruchi which serves 3 types of regional thalis - Gujurati, Punjabi or Rajasthani). It felt safe around the areas.We were upgraded to a Premium Room at no extra cost for no apparent reason and the room was more than adequate in terms of size and cleanliness. The buffet breakfast was a choice of either spicy Indian or bland western fare which was nothing to write home about but served its purpose.My only gripe about the place is the extorinate prices they charge for their taxi service. For example for the taxi ride to the station they charged us 250rs. The journey back from the station we used the pre paid taxi which cost us 50rs. Luckily we used the pre paid service from the airport which came to 350rs as opposed to the 900rs or so they were charging.Overall all though the experience was pleasant enough and would probably recommend this place. Rooms are clean and a decent size but the atmosphere somewhat sterile. "
the florence inn ,"Very Decent The hotel was good overall, the rooms were very clean, I liked the fact that they had TV in English and in French, I was jetlagged so I watched a lot of TV.The Food was decent, I'm glad the breakfast was included, it made it easier for me.The only little glitch is the pick up from the airport; they didnt' tell me that the driver wil be waiting for me outside so I waited inside and I couldn't see anyone holding a banner with my name, and after I waited for a little while I ended buying a pre-paid taxi for a 250 rupees ( the hotel had charged me 900 Rs). and once I left the airport I saw the driver outside, so I got stuck with the pre-paid taxi ticket which the hotel didn't want to reduce it from the 900 Rs. ( I ended up using it 3 weeks later when I came back to Delhi for a day). "
the florence inn ,"If you want to be exploited stay here. Positives:-Clean rooms and generally good standard overall for the hotel. Air Con works.Negatives:-Not 24hr hot waterFood is bland at bestManagement will try and exploite and extort money at every opportunity.We were charged over 1000 rupees just for a taxi from the airport to the hotel. We confirmed with the pre-paid taxi rank that this should cost no more than 350 rupees. When arguing with the manager about this, he had a stack of excuses longer than my arm ready for the offing. There after, service was offered at an absolute bare minimum to meet their standards. We booked tourist advice separately from the hotel, and was interogated on a daily basis what we were doing, who with, and how much it cost. Regardless of what we would say they could always do things faster/better/cheaper.Breakfast was bland and spicy - too hot even for my tastebuds, let alone my wifes. Whilst the hotel is located on a quiet side-road, the area itself is very busy, and even by Delhi standards not a particularly safe area for tourists after dark. "
the florence inn ,Loved the Hotel The best place to stay if you are in Delhi. Its not too expensive and the service is the best. You would really be very comfortable once you get in eventhough you are a foreign tourist. One more thing that I liked is that there is a restaurant inside the hotel and so you need not find out a place to eat or order into your room. you can collect as many as your friends and take them to this restaurant in this hotel and enjoy. The food is really hygenic. Try it out. 
the florence inn ,"Peaceful haven Peaceful and quiet position after the hustle of Delhi's streets. Welcoming staff and tidy, small but clean room. "
the florence inn ,"Great Value and great service I stayed at the hotel at the beginning of April having pre-booked over the phone. The hotel is great value (I paid the equivalemt of approx £42) and is certainly a ruby amongst the dust of places in Delhi within this price range - see the reviews of a lot of other hotels within this range in Delhi and you'll see what I mean. The location is very handy, just meters from Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bargh. It's especially useful if you're going there to do lots of shopping as the shops are literally on the doorstep but without being so close to be effected by noise. The metro station is also very close and just two stops from Connuaght Place (Rajiv Chowk).My parents went a week ahead of me and were very well looked after. My room had everything a good standard room should have including ac and fan, satellite TV, minibar. Good bathroom with the usual bathtub and shower combination. The management and team are extremely helpful and deal with any issues or problems very quickly. The food is good and room service is also available 24 hours. All areas and rooms are very clean as well as very well decorated and they seem to be constantly keeping an eye on this. It seems to have been recently modernised and very popular for large business meetings - this I guess helps to ensure the standard is kept high. They also have an PC for internet access in the reception as well as WIFI throughout the hotel but it's worth checking this is working before going if it's an important feature for you.I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone and I will be going back on my next trip. "
the florence inn ,"Fantastic value for money The Hotel Florence Inn was our first hotel that we stayed in during our trip around the Golden Triangle. As we were travelling in the budget range ,our expectations were not very high so we were more than delighted to find that the Florence Inn provided us with sparkling clean rooms and excellent service. The rooms had their own combination safe, cable TV and cheap, well stocked minibar. The in-house restaurant and room service meals were excellent value for money (about $4 Australia an for a big multi-serve vegetarian meal). The front desk staff were very helpful and polite. "
the florence inn ,"loved the castle We have just returned from a week at the florence inn. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel. It was so hot and busy there. All the staff's were friendly and helpfull. initially I Tried to book with the hotel directly, but I found reservation manager was beat harsh and was not willing to give us a good rate. later on I booked through one of my family friend. As soon as we reached hotel I saw a lovely person standing with smiling face,(sudenhdu). He made my stay very happy by giving me a nice room. I found some thing very bad i.e Mr. Ashish loby manager was not at all good enough. He called us so many times in our room extn. asking about further trips to india. he was trying to organise our trips to india, where as I never asked him about. I met another manager Avtar in the front desk who was very sweet and nice person.I will definetely recomend this hotel for guest coming to Dellhi. "
the florence inn ,"Clean Hotel Busy Surroundings Since this was our first visit to India, we were really were not prepared for the culture shock. We were glad to be picked up by the hotel (however, at a ridiculously high price of Rs1000 which they later charged us). However, we did manage to escape all the sharks (scary looking taxi &amp; autodrivers, tour operators) waiting outside the airport ready to pounce on us. When we got to the hotel, we were greeted by two men at the reception: both not all that pleasant. We checked in and the room was actually quite nice. Had a nice ambience, yet felt a bit detached. The bathroom was nice, everything worked. Best thing was the SONY flat screen TV! We didn't want to go out of the room since we were still nauseous by the Delhi traffic and the poverty we saw outside, but then decided to get changed and went down to eat at the Hotel restaurant. The restaurant was an extremely tight 3.5m x 3.5m closed space. We were two women alone in the restaurant with four men (waiters) and I have never felt so uncomfortable and insecure in my life. We were constantly stared at. We got the food to be takeaway and locked ourselves in our rooms and stayed there the whole night. The next morning we were relieved to see another tourist in the restaurant and more so thereafter.Overall, the stay here was quite pleasant. The surrounding area was busy, a bit dirty, but the staff was pretty helpful. There's only one computer for Internet access which is at the reception. For downloading pics from our cameras, we went to the office and were pleasantly surprised to see the owner, Mr. Jaydeep Bhat there. He was most helpful and kind. Even got us tea while we transferred photos and patiently sat there with us, and talked for almost an hour!I would recommend this hotel for Delhi if you're looking for clean rooms at a good price.Due to complete lack of female staff, it can be a bit intimidating being surrounded by staring men. One tip: Always carry a business card of the hotel. It has a map of where the hotel is located. Most autowallahs don't know where it is and you will need to direct them here. You can obtain the card from the reception desk. "
the florence inn ,"Comfortable and exceeding expectations The Florence is a nice little hotel tucked away in Karol Bagh, and miles better than we had expected or hoped for, for the very reasonable price of INR 3000-3500 (the lower price is for standard; higher price for deluxe; we stayed in both over 2 nights).The location is very convenient for the metro - a 5 minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is, and then it's only 3 stops to Rajiv Chowk aka Connaught Place. There's an internet terminal in the lobby and wi-fi throughout the hotel, both at a charge of 30 rupees for 30 minutes.We expected very little from this hotel, and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were clean, relatively well maintained (not shabby) and quiet. The main difference we could see between the standard room where we stayed the first night, and the deluxe room, was the slightly bigger size - but the size of the standard was fine. Our friends also stayed in a standard room and it seems some come with a wet room (fairly standard in India) while others with a bathroom (i.e. with a tub). All clean and comfy though and well equipped.We had dinner in the hotel on the first night and the food was fine, surprisingly not that greasy, and reasonably priced. Although they don't advertise it on the menu, beer is available (and because it wasn't printed anywhere, we even negotiated the price down!). Breakfast was simple and nice. Staff were polite and helpful.Would definitely recommend this hotel - it makes all the difference in a place like Delhi to have a quiet, safe place to come home to, "
the florence inn ,"Nice hotel We stayed here twice during our trip around the Golden Traingle. The hotel was organised as part of our tour. Our first time we got a very standard room but the second time, it was a much nicer room. The hotel is clean and the staff are attentive. The minute you step out of your room when checking out there is someone to help you with your bags. A little hectic in the morning with everyone checking out at the same time. Breakfeast was not as good as the other hotels I stayed in India. The metro is close by but we did not use it. "
the florence inn ,"Loved the Florence! Loved our almost month long stay in Delhi at the Florence. Actually it became our home away from home. Stayed with my inlaws and my 3 year old son. The staff was absolutely phenomenal! They were so attentive to my son's needs and to our own - they gave my son balloons as he had commented on a guest's balloons. They even 'rescued' him from an elevator incident! Room service was quick, efficient; food was excellent. Truly appreciated our clean amazing room along with it's completely western style bathroom.Make sure if you can that you hire a driver for your stay, it will make your visit pleasurable and non-stressed as no one should drive the city streets of Delhi. And besides at around $2.00 a day, it's definately worth it! So don't worry how far everything is in Delhi, it's all relative. Actually I found that the hotel was very conveniently located - Karol Bagh which is excellent street shopping, and about 10 minutes away from Connaught Place.Thank you so very much to the staff there - again, they were exceptional! As a very well traveled Canadian, I will definately be staying there again and highly recommend this hotel. "
the florence inn ,"GREAT PLACE --- clean/quality space friendly + trustworthy staff good price I spent 7 months in India -- lived in Delhi and Bangalore for extended periods, and traveled throughout the country (i was a study abroad student, then did some volunteering). As a 21 year old female, safety and cleanliness were my top priority when I found myself booking hotels when I was alone. It is about time that I give this hotel a great review. Nothing comes cheap in Delhi, especially when it comes to finding a place to stay. I knew i wanted something safe, and clean -- and so I decided to avoid any accommodation in the Paharganj area (near railway station). Although the Florence Inn is not the most convenient place if you are hoping to explore South Delhi, it is not too far away from CP and Old Delhi, and isn't too bad in general if you are accustomed to a commute (or Delhi traffic). And compared to other nice places, it is a great deal! You won't find such quality for this price anywhere else in Delhi! (when you are traveling in other places in India outside big cities like Delhi or Mumbai, you will be able to find cheaper places). I stayed in this hotel a few times, both alone and with friends. Each time, I stayed in their cheapest room. The cheapest rooms, however, still felt like luxury. The basics -- Clean sheets, towels, soaps, etc. And also, marble bathrooms, plentiful counter space in the bathroom, TV with HBO + news channels, hot shower with good pressure. It is definitely a place that meets Western standards. The service and staff were great -- They are willing to help and answer questions and are very attentive. The staff carried my suitcases for me into my room ( i never felt uncomfortable around them). The staff at the front desk who speak very good English let me use the internet for free in the lobby and print things out (for a small price) on their office printer. Further, after i checked out, but wanted to do errands and go out, I was able to leave luggage safely in the lobby. They even let me leave some luggage for a couple of weeks in a storage room -- it was all there when i got back, in perfect condition. There is free breakfast every morning -- which has options for everyone. And the restaurant also serves lunch and dinner. They also have room service if you want to eat in the privacy of your room or get a quick snack (they have great iced coffee and parathas). Also, they have a reliable, quick laundry service. When my friends visited me and they arrived in India for the first time, I took them here. They appreciated the quality of the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel! To book - just call the front desk! Find number on their website. The place can be tricky to find -- The hotel can arrange to pick you up and take you right to the hotel. It is extremely close to the Karol Bagh Metro station and this is where you should be dropped off once you have figured out how to walk from station to the hotel. Also, to be safe, carry a hotel business card with you so you have their number on hand -- they can give directions to your driver, if necessary. "
the florence inn ,"Average hotel The hotel accommodation was ok... decent enough for 2 people... but we're got worried about the noise, cause the rooms are not so noise proofed... we can hear people from the other room showering and their baby crying... my girlfriend jess was not able to sleep at all... breakfast was ok though... and we love the location... it's in the affordable shopping district... "
the florence inn ,"Lovely quiet and clean hotel We arrived late at night, 2 tired mums with three tired teen daughters, and were so relieved to find ourselves in this quiet little oasis. the rooms were spacious and spotless, the breakfast was delicious, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. we would highly recommend this hotel for other travellers. "
the florence inn ,"Great Hotel There were 6 of us at this hotel including two under 3's.We have stayed in Delhi previoulsy and therefore were aware of the Karol Bagh area. It can seem scary at night but the actual location of the hotel is safe and convenient - right next to the metro.The staff are all great, helpful but the hotels greatest asset is the cleaners - it is so clean which as a mother I was so thankful for as it saved any upset stomachs with the kids.My children had braekfast and dinner at the hotels and I have no complaints. Restaurant is small but pleasant.There is internet access and the water is never cold! "
the florence inn ,"Exceeded expectations In looking for hotels in Delhi, an affordable hotel without scary reviews is hard to find. The Florence Inn was clean and affordable and ideal. I highly recommend this hotel. The staff was overall very helpful and nice. We changed our travel plans after we arrived to see Agra and Jaipur. They happily changed our days for free.If this is your first time in India, as one of the other reviews pointed out, the neighborhood at night appears quite scary. We arrived late at night. However, once you see the area in the day, you will realize it is not that bad (and right beside a fun market, especially on Monday). I never felt threatened in this area. If I ever return to Delhi, I plan on booking a room at the Florence Inn. "
the florence inn ,"Not a great hotel We arrived in Delhi at around 3am and after an arduous journey trying to find the hotel (the taxi driver didn't know it at all) we arrived at the Hotel Florence. We were not allowed to check in, but were despatched immediately to the sister hotel the Florence Inn, being told there was no room left at this hotel. Language barrier prevented us from complaining so we went along to the Florence Inn.The rooms aren't unclean but just wasn't very comfortable. We had a single sheet and a single blanket on a double bed, and the towels felt old. The staff were not very friendly or accommodating but did help us when asked. The breakfast was limited (we had toast) and the tablecloths were dirty. I didn't feel I could trust anything else to eat.I suppose all, in, for a budget hotel in this part of town, it was okay, but I would make sure next time that I was somewhere more central and a bit higher class - you have to remember that 4* in many parts of India are not the same as 4* in the UK. "
the florence inn ,Clean and Comfortable The Florence inn was a transit hotel for us. We missed our flight and didn't anticipate spending 3 nights there. It was clean and comfortable. The water was always hot. We stayed in twin rooms the service was prompt even when we locked ourselves out at 3am. Rooms are probably a little small but worth the money and there is free internet in the lobby. The view isn't too exciting but it's not very central to Dehli. There were markets close to the hotel and lots of good eateries. The small restaurant did both indian and western breakfast and was really convenient for quick snacks in the day but also had full lunch and dinner available. A good clean and comfortable stay. Probably a 3 star experience. 
the florence inn ,"Good clean but v little natural light There are two sister hotels, Florence inn and Hotel florence, both in Karol Bagh and apparently more or less the same. We stayed in Hotel Florence, which was very clean and a good hotel for our first few nights in Delhi. Room service and the restaurant were good and reasonably priced. Staff were friendly enough and we got a complimentary breakfast for booking through Desiya.com.Karol Bagh was an OK area, lots of sari shops and clothes nearby but little else. Also very little in the way of restaurants. Its closish to the metro though, which is definately the quickest, cheapest and most pleasant way of getting into the centre of town (Rs 8 each way plus a Rs10 rickshaw ride to from hotel to station).The only issue I had with the room was that the window faced into a shaft through which we got very little natural light, which made getting up difficult.Price was about Rs 2000 per night (or a little over that). Would reccommend for garunteed cleanliness. "
the florence inn ,"Decent + close to the subway Not being able to afford the five-stars, Delhi seemed a really hard place to find good value accommodation. After reading a couple of good reviews, we went with the Florence Inn and, all-in-all, were satisfied with that.Still, one would think that a “deluxe room” would come with at least one window, which it didn’t, and the neighbourhood (Karol Bagh) is not especially trendy. However, we felt entirely safe in the surroundings, and the nearby shopping street is good for clothes and lots more.One main advantage with Florence Inn is its proximity to a station of the newly built and well functioning Delhi metro – it’s clean, cheap, rather comfortable and very practical (although not covering south Delhi).One complaint: upon departure we booked and paid (quite a lot) for an airport taxi ride. That taxi showed up more than 20 minutes late and turned out to be some junky private car with the managers buddy behind the wheel! He got us to the airport all right, but such a pathetic mini-rip-off meant we left Florence Inn with a bit of a bad aftertaste. "
the florence inn ,Liked the hotel a lot - good value for money The rooms are small but very clean and the ambience is good. Its a good value for money. I lived in delux room. The staff are very cooperative. The maintainence is good. The toilets are clean. The food is also tasty and hygenic. 
the florence inn ,"Not a great start to India I booked this hotel as it seemed to have good reviews on Tripadviser. Although it wasnt too bad, the rooms were comfortable and clean, we just didnt like the feel of the hotel.Everyone just seemed to hover around you, musty smells everywhere, Bad aircon, breakfast was interesting and in a room no larger than a standard bathroom. Location was safe, just typical India really. Very interesting area to walk around but probably not at nightDelhi isnt cheap, but I would reccomend spending more for your hotels here. "
the florence inn ,"Good hotel but scary location We stayed here in September 2007 as part of a trekking expedition. we stayed here a few nights at the start and end of the trip. It's a good basic hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are comfy and adequate. The only bugbear was noisy aircon.Beware the beggars and the market outside the hotel. It's not dangerous but it's intimidating. It gave us a flavour of what street life is like in delhi.Recommend the Crossroads bar around the corner with good food, drink and ambience. It seems to be a magnet for ex pats and tourists. We watched India win the 20/20 cricket here and the atmosphere was electric.Overall no complaints. good straightforward accomodation. "
the florence inn ,"Stay away I booked a room through a travel agent for 2 nights for three of us. I was told we would either receive one double bed and one twin bed, or 3 twin beds. What we got was 2 twin beds and a mattress on the floor wedged in between the other 2 beds and dresser. The room was very run down and tiny. We had to climbed over each others beds to get to the bathroom. The air conditioning unit dripped all night long on one of the beds and it was musty and dirty. I've stayed in many low budget rooms in India before and this was the worst. The pictures I saw on the hotel website were not what our room looked like at all. And not that it mattered to us, but our room was on the 4th floor and the elevator only goes to the 3rd floor, so if walking upstairs is difficult, keep that in mind. "
the florence inn ,"A pleasant suprise We stayed at Florence Inn for 2 nights in Sept 07 and were impressed by the nicely renovated character building. Although no view to speak of, the rooms were well-appointed compared to other indian hotels we tried. A/c, shower, TV, fridge all worked! Market and metro are nearby, however it is at the end of a lane so I wouldn't want to return alone after dark "
the florence inn ,"Good value hotel We read about this hotel at India Mike and we tried it for 1 night at the end of our travel and we were very happy with the choice. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the service is correct. Also the neighbourhood is much more exciting than Pahar Ganj. We have been in many hotels during our India travel and this one was one of the best. The price/quality relation is better than other Delhi hotels and I can't understand why travel guides don't recommend Karol Bagh, i.e. the neighboorhood where Florence Inn is situated. There are a lot of shops and restaurants, few tourists and a good atmosphere at night. "

the grand inn ,"No good food for vegetarians I was 7 months pregnant hence i was given the best available hotels for the business trip to ensure that my trip is comfortable. But it turned out to be a bit pathetic as i was a vegetarian and there was hardly any good food for vegetarians. Additionally the food cost was also very high. The ambiance was good, rest all the amenities were good but my only worry was about the food which was not upto my satisfaction. I'm not sure if non-veggies would be happy to stay there. I stayed there for almost 10 days, more than myself i was worried about my baby who was yet to see the world. Thanks to GOD this stay didn't affect my health and i had a\delivered a healthy baby girl on 4th July 2009. That's it from my end :) "
the grand inn ,"Not worth the money If you try to find a hotel in Delhi that is somewhere between a €400 a night 5 star and a €10 flea pit, you will be disappointed. There seems to be very little in the way of nice, reasonably priced hotels in Delhi. We thought that we had done the exception with The Grand Inn - but we were sadly mistaken.We arranged for a pick up from the airport but there was no sign of anyone when we arrived so we phoned the hotel, who gave us the driver's mobile. It turned out that the driver was waiting outside because he wanted to keep the €0.10 that you have to pay to enter the airport. Ok, we thought, these things happen, no problem at all. So we followed the driver to the crappiest car you could imagine. We were surprised it even moved when it had to go downhill. And his driving style made me wish that the seatbelts had been left in the car rather than be cut out. Still, no problem. This is India, these things happen.We had booked a suite - and we got the one that is on their leaflet/website. Like many hotels in India the bed consists of an undersheet and a blanket - there is no top sheet. We took a look at the blanket and sheet, and decided to sleep on our sleeping bag. But no problem, this is India.Both the room and the bathroom had seen better days, many of them in fact. But since we only slept in the room we did not mind too much, after all this is India. We stayed in many places on our trip to India and this place was the worst. It would have been acceptable at maybe €15 a night - but you have to be the type of person who does not mind staying grotty, noisy, run down places in order to save a few quid. We had agreed a rate before we went and were expecting some tax to be added - but we ended up getting over 25% &quot;tax&quot; added to our bill, and paying about €65 a night. This place was definitely not worth it.The hotel itself is a bit out from the main sights in Delhi but it is easy to get a auto rickshaw in and out (about 50 rupees) and it takes about 30 mins to Connaught Place. It is on a busy enough road, and as the other reviewers commented there is nothing to see/do around the hotel. If I were to go back I think that I would take my chances with one of the places around Connaught Place that gets the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor. At least if it is as run down a this place you have things to do on your door step!(it is worth noting that at the time we went there were only 3 reviews of this place and they were reasonably enough. The once written since then have been more truthful!) "
the grand inn ,"Nice people poor location Very friendly staff who were keen to assist above and beyond the call of duty, and let me check in long before the official time.Adequately comfortable room. Hot water supply rather unreliable. A bit noisy at night (but then, this is India...). Drinkable coffee.I probably wouldn't stay here again, but that's primarily because of the location. It's a safe area and it's not too far from many sites of tourist interest, but it's a bit frustrating that (as far as I could find) there's nowhere to eat, nothing to see, nothing at all to do within walking distance - so you end up spending a lot of time in cabs or rickshaws.A couple of tips related to transport if you do stay here. It's usually easier to get a cab/rickshaw on the OTHER side of New Rohtak Road. And when returning to the hotel, ask for the Liberty Cinema - no drivers will know the hotel, but the cinema (about a short block away) is a well-known landmark. "
the grand inn ,"Right by train station but not so nice The Grand Inn is five minutes from the Delhi train station, which certainly is convenient for early departures. Also, it is in a quiet area. My brother and his wife had a room right next to mine. We shared a (very) mini walkout. Their room was OK. However, my room had not been cleaned and the bed had been slept in. The food we ordered was good. Still searching for a reliable budget hotel in New Delhi... "
the grand inn ,"DISGUSTING !!! Beware, this place is a dump ! Probably the other feedback critiques have been written by friends of the owners. There were cockroaches in the rooms, they don't even change the sheets for new guests (there were hairs in our beds - we slept fully clothed !), the sole towel that was once white is a horrible shade of grey. Location is extremely noisy just by a very busy main road, the area pretty grim as well. All in all, a rip off joint to be avoided at all costs. The &quot;suites&quot; are also not suites at all, just bigger rooms with the same grotty look. DISGUSTING !! "
the grand inn ,"WOW wonderful experiance stayin in this hotel, wonderful helpful staff, very near to best of the places, neat, good big rooms, good food, kind hearted staff, had wonderful staying in this hotel i think its priced decently had tight budget this time thought wud stay in some local cheap hotel but when travel agent booked this hotel thought it will be not be good but when reached there we got warm welcome and when we saw suites i was amazed and thanking god again and as it was vry clean and beautiful room with clean hygenic bathrooms which is imp thing and with all the facilities and vry vry helpful staff. i think best time we had in delhi and in our hotel room. "
the grand inn ,"A good (and reasonably-priced) hotel in Delhi I spent two nights at the Grand Inn and I must say I'm very satisfied. The rooms are ok. The food is very nice (and, of course, very spicy). And the employees are very helpful and friendly. The owner also personally helped us a lot. The hotel is relatively well situated (close to the Karol Bagh bazaar and not far (using the auto rickshaws) from Connaught Place). Finally, I believe the price is reasonable. I am planning to go to Delhi again next year and I'll definitely book the Grand Inn again...(Avinash Meetoo from Mauritius) "
the grand inn ,totally unbeliveable Its probably the best hotel you'll find in new delhi...every hotel has its own specialities but to find one completelly special hotel is very difficult. The Grand Inn is one of those comletly special hotels because of its following points.1)Location is excellent...2)Other hotel facilities are great. 3)Interiors are very nice and the rooms are specially made for complete rest and comfort...4)food quality is very high...It was great pleeasure to stay in THE GRAND INN... 
the grand inn ,"i loved this hotel a lot staff was very helpfull and friendly. i suggest this beautifull hotel to ppl who really want to enjoy the stay in delhi. the cost is good enough reasonable. 24 hrs room service is wow.would always go to this hotel if in delhi and also recommend my friends for this one., "
the grand new delhi ,"Love the use of space Delhi Hotels I am use to such as the Hyatt, Intercontinental, Sheraton or my favorite Shangrila where all booked so I was struggling to get hotel and given that I plan to stay in Delhi for more then a month and half I was hoping for the usual hotels. A friend booked the Grand hotel for me so needless to say I was worried about this hotel since I have never been to it before.I arrived at this hotel and as I walked into the lobby, the first thing I notice is how large and roomy the lobby is. It is open concept design with very high ceiling. This hotel has the largest and most roomy Lobby I have ever seen. Amount of room in the lobby is the first thing you notice and it is a welcome site given that Delhi is a very busy place.Hotel staff took minutes to register my stay and guided me to my room where they gathered the rest of my information they needed while providing information about my room.The hallways on the 4th floor where I stayed where not large however it really did not feel small. You can see the end of the hallways window which makes it more roomy then it is. The minute I walked into the room and I was shown the bathroom I stopped. I have no eye for art but I cannot overcome how simple yet beautiful the entire bathroom is with elegant wooden sliding doors to dark ceramic tiles that makes you stop and stare. I stayed in Shangrila, Intercontinental, Hilton, Hyatt and many other hotels which are all nice but the Grand by far found the perfect use of space and combined the closest, bathtub, shower and closet in to one space. It is also the one thing you will take a picture of and describe to family and friends.The entire room lets you breath with lots of space and very littlethings in your way. Flat TV hangs on side of the wall and a small bar is place under it it. Small work desk that faces a long hallway to the front door. It takes few seconds to get to the door when someone knocks it just to give you an idea of how large the room is and how simple layout makes it even larger.I have different taste for food since food is just food no matter what I eat. I cannot, therefore; give you a good review of the food at this hotel. I had no issues though other then smaller selection available after hours for room service. Sheraton did have a lot more selections at any given hour however.I spend most of my weekends in my room as I work a lot.I had no issues and with the room and loved the bathroom.I felt very comfortable and often had no reason to leave my room.Space is really the key for me personally and this room had plenty of it.Amenities included a fruit basket and lots of bottled water. This is the only hotel in Delhi where I had at least 3-5 bottles of waterat any given time. It is also the only hotel that provided the largest bottle of water at no cost. Typically you get small bottles and you have to pay for the larger ones. I take about 2 bottles a night to work and drink about 2. Housekeeping puts them all back by next day.Privacy is a big thing for me since I am sleeping daytime and working night time. Often in most hotels even with the do not disturb light house keeping calls me in every hotel I stayed.I explained my schedule on my arrival and had no issue for the most part but did get a call or two times. I slept in both times however and they where trying to get to my room as scheduled.Privacy is done via a switch by the bed.Iron is on request only at this hotel however. I needed it few times and one time I got it onetime other time I was told that they could do the ironing for me as they had no iron free. I had my shirt back in less then 10 minutes. Only issue I had was that they of course did a better job then I could and would prefer if the iron was always not available.Internet is the most essential thing for me and in room internet by cable only. Speed varies from slow to high depending on timeof day. You can steam media mornings and evening but slows down in the afternoon. Internet was down in my room once after 3 weeks of stay. I called and I was told it will be up by morning and it was. It was 4:30AM however and I just finished work. Business Center was not effected.I am use to Nortel phones and this room had one at the desk.I do not use hotel phone for long distance and not sure howit compares to other hotels. My room had 3 phones. One by the bed, one on the desk and one in the bathroom which I would never use for any reason. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and have done so for other visitors from my company who stay at Shangrila usually. This is hotel is different from the most flashy but equally nice hotels. It is is unique hotel in terms of space and interior design. "
the grand new delhi ,"Nice - Some faults Hotel was booked by my company.My first visit to Delhi after 12 years, so many changes.Not the area of choice. There are things close by, but you need to take a taxi.It's a good alternative to staying at an airport hotel.Reception : Souless. Reminded me of an airport terminal.Room - Excellent. Comfortable bed, excellent bathroom with a wet shower and a huge tub.Flat screen tv with enough channels to satisfy most.Room size was good.The hotel was less than 45% full. I found the staff very polite but pretty useless.At breakfast - keeping in mind that the hotel was only 45% full, you'd ask for coffee and wait an eternity for it. Ask for toast and it would arrive after you finished eating your eggs.The internet was down for 24 hours. When I checked at reception, I was told it would not be back for the rest of the day. I plugged in my LAN cable an hour later, it was working, but no one thought to call me back and let me know.I enquired over internet charges and no one thought to ifnorm me the first hour was complimentary, so I rushed to cover my work in 1 hour thinking I did not want to be charged for 2.Probably the worst food I have ever had in India.We have excellent Indian food in the UK and was far better than the Grand.I have no idea where they source their meat, but their lamb ( mutton ) was disgusting.If you can afford it and have time, take yourself to Bukhara at the Maurya or elsewhere.Any special facilities extended to you - get it in writing. Anything given to me complimentary or as part of an ' arrangement ' was met with denial.There are 2 restaurants : One is the western style - where breakfast is served. The other is Indian. A bar - empty for the 5 nights I was there. "
the grand new delhi ,"Owesome services The services of Hotel is supreme, one of the best in Delhi for sure.Interiors, exteriors, all are royal with luxurious comfort, and food are also so delisious.... "
the grand new delhi ,"Good location but highly overpriced The hotel is under renovation,It sells under the shadow of Grand Hyatt its erstwhile name,Be warned ,the hotel had caught fire a year back due to maintenance defects and poor upkeep.Its a beautiful hotel but stay here at your own risk.I booked through the website looking at the photos,but the hotel is highly overpriced for the money it charges,few restaurants not open yet.I spoke to some people and they siad quality has suffered since all staff had left post the fire incident.Surprised,how the Federal Fire department gave ok to pen so soon. "
the grand new delhi ,"One night stay - beautiful room I just stayed one night there, as I was returning from Jaipur and leaving next morning back home. The hotel has been under renovation and it is very beautiful. I had to write the review, because the bathroom was one of the best I have seen in any hotel around. The room was also very spacious and nice, the only problem we experienced was that over the ac (when turned off), you could hear the neighbouring room: We had neighbours having a party or something, so in the middle of the night it was hard to sleep because you would hear the laughter of the other guests. "
the grand new delhi ,Good I was stayed with my boss &amp; it was nice stay. It has good pub but calm. Gym &amp; swimming has some construction work going on. 
the grand new delhi ,"Loved the stay there. The Grand,New Delhi, is the place to have a perfect stay.Had been a menber with Them and always enjoyed the faboulos fascilities.It was a great stay always.Have stayed there couple of times and everytime we left it with a good smileJetPrivilege membership: [--] "
the grand new delhi ,"Hotel under renovation but continue to books guests at outrageous rates Be forewarned: Although the website suggests otherwise, this hotel is effectively closed and under renovation (following a fire in the hotel over one year ago). The reception desk is closed, none of the restaurants or bars are open, no taxi stand, etc. It's also in the middle of a nowhere and surrounded by construction sites. Staying here would be a bit like staying in the Twilight Zone -- and paying $380 per night to do so. Management appear unethical. Total scam. I happened upon the hotel when I wen to the spa which is associated with the spa. Great spa, but avoid the hotel until it is actually opened. The poor guests I met at the spa who booked rooms (due to its proximity to the airport and promising website) were furious and preparing to prepare a formal complaint with the tourism authorities. "
the grand new delhi ,"A strange place to stay This new hotel is isolated so be sure your taxi driver knows how to get there before departing from the airport. Getting a taxi to go someplace from the hotel will also be difficult. More important, the hotel is not fully functional or operational. When I stayed there was no restaurant -- lunches and dinners must be ordered from room service. There was no business center or internet access. A note of cautions -- the marble floors in the showers are dangerously slippery when wet. "
the grand new delhi ,"In the middle of nowhere Great hotel - but in the middle of nowhere. It is more like an airport hotel location. The hotel from the inside is awesome. Great swimming pools, sauna etc, beautifully decorated (but small) rooms with nice bathrooms. Service was not very good (but hey this is Delhi). The location is just very bad, a lot of rubble and construction around the place and not views at all. "
the grand new delhi ,"Good business hotel convenient to airport Overall a reliable choice for business travellers to Delhi (was recommended to me by locals) when you don't need to stay in the center of Delhi. I'd stay here again on a return visit.Pros- Well appointed rooms with separate shower/bath. Bottled water provided in room. - Good breakfast buffet, and also good lunch buffet .- Close to the airport (flights can arrive very late in Delhi as mine did 1:30am)- Airport pick up car service worked very well (book this ahead with the hotel, extra charge). (There is the traffic police's prepaid taxi service at the airport as well but I didn't use it.)- Well equipped fitness center for a hotel, with around 10 different cardio bikes/treadmills/ellipticals and half a dozen weight machines plus free weights- Attractive grounds and lobby area, well staffed and very good serviceCons- Room rates in Delhi are high and The Grand is no exception. My cost was over $300/night including breakfast. You might want to book through a local if you have a contact for better rates.- Location is south of the city, nothing to see withing walking distance today (a major new shopping mall is going up nearby so that will change in time). Travel time to center (Connaught Place / India Gate) or the Gurgaon business district can take 30+ minutes by car (hiring a driver for the day is advisable if you have multiple stops or just want to be sure of your transport back. Taxis aren't that common and traffic is nothing short of amazing--can be both chaotic and often jammed with bikes, pedestrians, and every imaginable vehicle on wheels).- Some of the hotel carpet and furniture is tired and worn, but all the natural granite, wood and waterfalls more than make up for it. "
the grand new delhi ,"Beautiful hotel I stayed here for 2 weeks with a friend. This is a beautiful place with top quality service. In fact, they pretty much OVER serve you- by coming into your room like 4 times a day to do things, but I think thats part of the culture. Theres a lovely spa, nice gym, tranquel pool and just a nice place to stay. Outside the hotel is dirty and rough looking but thats the area of New Delhi. "
the grand new delhi ,"""Fantastic Hotel"" !!!!! Stayed only 1 night early Sept 2007. Location is near airport (15 mins). Rooms large, clean and comfy. Price $300AU p/night incl b/fast. Restaurants (2) were excellent, we sampled Italian ($100AU incl alcohol, entree &amp; main) and was good. Service in hotel was excellent. B/fast buffet best in India (on our 5 weeks holiday). Pool is large, heaps of sun lounges and quiet at this time (no children! Yeh!). Pool food/drinks (Beer $24AU for 2 bottles long) service non existent but that was sorted, quickly.There is nothing outside hotel (vacant land and highway) so don't expect to go out wandering or &quot;seeing&quot; Delhi at night. Take auto into central Delhi (40 mins). Hotel great for business and also tourist if in need of &quot;a no hassle India&quot; for a break. Good for next day flight. Taxi (ambassador) to airport Rs 150 max. "
the grand new delhi ,"spacious rooms As i walk through with my wife to the hotel it looked like walking to a mansion. A tremendous looby is waiting for you on your arrival. check in time taken by the front office was good. we went to the room without any escort, that is really bad for a first timer in the hotel. Rooms are excellent, spacious, neat and clean. breakfast was at cafe which is huge place only drop back of that area is that the buffet is at the last end of the cafe. for a person sitting on front section is quite annoying going to the buffet and helping himself again and again. service was excellent by the cheerful staff. up keep of the place was not so good. all the points on the rating goes to the rooms andthe staff at the cafe. "
the grand new delhi ,"Nice accomodations but a bit out remote This is a well maintined hotel outside of New Delhi. If you are looking for convenience to local places including Connaught Place, you should expect to spend some time in a car or cab. Hotel car can be a bit pricey, but secure if traveling alone. The rooms are very, very nice, as is most of the staff. Prices here have been escalating for some time and rooms on &quot;club&quot; floors are identicle to every other room - expect to pay more anyway. I've stayed here many weeks at a time over the past 4 years and have always been pleased at the end of the stay. Food service can be exasperatingly slow (especially in the main cafe), so go to breakfast/lunch or dinner with plenty of time. Food and service in the Indian and Italian restaraunts is great. Beds are very comfortable and the room is cleaned every day, if desired. You can turn off your doorbell for privacy - just don't forget to turn it back on if you want room service.Pool, gym and spa are all very well kept and modern. Food and beverage are available by the pool. "
the grand new delhi ,"What a Terrible Front Desk Overall, the hotel is nice and comfortable. However, the front desk staff is filled with automatons that can't handle anything outside of what is scripted for them by management. I had a decent experience with the restaurants, the health spa, and the overall experience but the front-desk was completely unwilling and unable to comprehend the fact that they were overcharging me as compared to the booking made at travelocity. I was completely turned off by the front desk staff and travelocity's customer service staff. I would NOT stay at the grand again or use travelocity. I have a full detailed explanation of the situation here [--] "
the grand new delhi ,"Grand New Delhi I stayed there last year. The hotel is very nice. It is very nice when you come back from Delhi with all its noise and dirt and you enter this well kept place.Reception is pretty slow. The spa is very nice. I liked the food in the indian restaurant a lot. The other restaurants are not that great. Rooms are extremely spacious. And the hotel is pretty new-or at least it looks new. This is very important as I have been to some older top-end hotels in Delhi and you would not like to stay there. Prices may be a bit high but it is worth it.Overall, a good place to stay after a long working day. "
the grand new delhi ,"Excellent relaxing break before flying back to London I first stayed at this hotel 4 years ago when it was owned by the Hyatt group and loved every minute (100% better than Hotel Nikko that I'd booked into originally but decided to check out of as it felt so claustrophic and busy). I left the Grand at that time thinking that it was one of the best hotels I had ever stayed in. I was nervous of booking in again this time having read some of the reviews and realising that it was no longer a Hyatt group hotel and was worried that the standards might have fallen but the rates on offer were lower than any of the other hotels I was interested in ($200 per night plus taxes) and I needn't have worried as I had the most wonderful 2 night stay. The whole hotel feels calm and relaxed, the rooms are very spacious, well designed and furnished with extremely comfortable beds and fantastic bathrooms (marble everywhere and big fluffy white towels). The Oasis Spa treatments were excellent and well priced and and the pool area is one of the best I have seen in a city hotel. The pool is enormous and set in the middle of beautiful gardens. The hotel is a little out of the way (about 20 minutes taxi ride into the centre) but all I wanted to do was relax and do a bit of shopping so it suited me to be away from the traffic and noise of New Delhi and hopped into a cab whenever I needed to (which you have to do wherever you stay). Service throughout was good but I have to say I don't think the club level is worth paying the extra for. The food is better in the restaurant and you also get to sit with views of the gardens rather than the club level lounge on the sixth floor. I don't think the staff were particularly helpful with enquiries about hiring taxis (I was quoted 5000 rupees to hire a driver for the day when 2 weeks earlier I'd paid about 1400 rupees at another 5 star hotel) and I'm fairly sure I was overquoted on the taxi going back to the airport. However apart from these minor things, I thought the staff were extremely helpful and I loved my stay here. I left feeling totally relaxed and would definitely stay here again. "
the grand new delhi ,"not a great experience first impressions are a deceiving, on arrival the hotel looked very impressive, however our stay did not live up to our first impression. 2 of the guests in our party had problems with check in and were given temporary rooms as there was over booking. Both were told they were being upgraded for one night and would have to move. When moved the room they were moved to was exactly the same, one person refused to move as reception twice asked them to come back. My room had very noisy aircon, which was eventually sorted out. The safe did not work. The whole corridor had a very unpleasant smell which did not go away for the 4 nights we were there. Service was inconsistent. Would not stay at this hotel again! "
the grand new delhi ,"Superb Simply the best hotel that we have ever stayed in, Everything was excellent. A bit out of town but there are v. cheap taxis just outside. Transport to, an hour at the market, and return £5 including generous tip!!!! "
the grand new delhi ,"Nice hotel but no room ... We got in late (or early) at 3 am with a confirmed reservation for two rooms, just to hear they were overbooked and despite the confirmation unable to give us room before 45 minutes or so. Finally, at 5 am, we got to the rooms. Everything else was fine, but this was our first and last visit to the Grand. "
the grand new delhi ,"The good the bad and the very very ugly Delhi was busy, all the usual suspects were full, I had no choice desipite some of the reviews. I was heading for the Grand.First Impressions were good. This is a large impressive hotel, clean and well decorated. There were plenty of free staff at check in but when I tried to get my room I was told I had been given a free upgrade and had to check in on the sixth floor. I tudged up there to find a queue and some of the slowest poorly trained reception staff I have ever come across. it took 45mins to get from reception into my room. This may appear a small thing but flights from Europe land into India late night or early morning. Its the last thing I needed.Despite the reception problem the room was fantastic, black marble shower and bath, walk in wardrobe, lounge and bedroom, 5 star standard.Since all the flights land so late it would be nice to get a late night drink in the hotel. Delhi have granted late licences for some of the large US luxury chains - not the Grand. I sat in my nice room,on my own with the two bottles of beer from the minbar.The next day I had the most shocking experience with the food. The restaurants served me underdone, tepid prawns followed by undercooked chicken. Both of which I sent away. No five star hotel should serve food in this way, the health implications are serious. Beware!The other really startling thing is the price - $450/night. Now I dont mind the cost if I get the quality goods but with the poorly trained staff, the dodgy food its just not worth thr risk.Altogether this is one to avoid. "
the grand new delhi ,"Absolutely Horrible Stay My room was booked by my local office in Delhi at the &quot;Corporate Rate&quot; of nearly $300 USD for the night. The room was actually quite nice but having arrived somewhat late on a flight from Bangkok I decided on staying in the room instead of exploring. I ordered room service from the &quot;Around the Clock&quot; menu. Simple - I wanted a milk shake and chicken sandwich with cheese. What I received was Strawberry Quik mixed with milk and some sort of mystery meat on a bun. I couldn't even eat the sandwich due to the fishy taste of the chicken. I ate a bag of chips from the mini bar and fell asleep. My flight was early so I showered in a very nice bathroom and headed to the front desk forgoing the included breakfast. At check-out I complained to the clerk about the absolutely apalling meal. He completely ignored my complain and produced my bill which included the $25 meal I didn't eat. I refused to sign until he contacted the manager. The manager couldn't be bothered to see me in person and told his clerk over the phone that he could reduce the food charge by 15% - what a gesture. Included in my bill was a charge for &quot;VAT Meal Plan&quot;. I assume this was for the included breakfast I didn't eat and was told by the clerk he couldn't change the bill anymore. I filled out a survey and voiced my dismay in writing but I'm sure it won't help. All in all - the rooms are overpriced at $300 and of course the customer service left so much to be desired. I've been to India before and found Delhi to be even dirtier than I remember the last time. Except for the very few tourist type things - I will never route through Delhi again, unless absolutely necessary. If I am, I will not be staying at this hotel again. "
the grand new delhi ,beautiful hotel This is a very nice hotel. It feels big. The breakfast was excellent but the service in the Japanese restaurant was poor when we were there and dinner in the coffee shop was fair. The rooms are nice and staff was friendly. 
the grand new delhi ,"Far too expensive You must be careful when booking and negotiating a price with this hotel, there are hidden costs and taxes which you don't see till checkout. The rooms are the same whatever floor you are on. Dont get sucked into the 6th floor 'Club floor'. Its pointless and offers little for the extra money involved. The 'Happy hour' lounge is free between 6pm to 8pm which offers good food, unfortunately the drinks waiters made themselves obvious by their long spells of absence whilst your glass sat there dry. I paid 1000 USD plus 4126 rupees in cash for two nights. That works out to be circa £300 per night. I knew I shouldn't have had those cashew nuts out of the minibar! "
the grand new delhi ,Bad customer service Our travel agent booked us the Grand for our last day in India as we had a 1:45am flight back to Canada. The room was to be for day use only. After check in the bellman took our bags to the room. He informed us that this room was &quot;warm&quot;. Actually it was about 35C in the room.The A/C in this room was broken. This fact was known to the bellman so I can only assume it was known to the front desk.My wife called down to the front desk to request a room change. They informed her they would send a repair man to fix the A/C. She reminded the front desk we only had the room for a few hours and wished to dress/shower prior to the flight. When she again asked for a new room the clerk simply hung the phone up. My wife stormed to the front desk past a workman in the room trying to fix the A/C. For some reason they did not want to move us. Finally after 15 minutes they agreed. While the new room was cool it had to be the smallest single room in the hotel (about 1/3 the size of the previous room). We were now one hour into our stay and simply stayed in this room. Very poor customer service. 
the grand new delhi ,"Great Hotel for the price We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights only in the middle of September. Here is what we experienced:1. Checking in process -- took less than 10 minutes. Everything was booked already by Orbitz. They just assigned us a room after some initial signatures and other formalities. The crew were courteous and accomodating to your needs.2. Room -- Great room! A very comfortable one also. We asked for a crib for our 18-month-old. It was provided at the same time.The bathroom was nice. The overall decor of the room was very good too. Above all, the room was quiet.3. Restaurant/Food -- This was complimentary and we loved it. The stuff was very hospitable and was always attentive. The food was delicious -- both at the buffet and during dinner.4. Checking out process -- This took less than 5 minutes.I'd love to go back to this hotel and I'd recommend it to others for the price I paid (US $180 approx.). "
the grand new delhi ,"LOVED IT!!!! the only down point that we were only here for 2 nights. It is simply the very best hotel I have ever stayed in and the gardens, the pool, and the whole design of the place was second to none. The staff were friendly polite and helpful. A peaceful haven yet close to the airport for conveneince. Would love to go back "
the grand new delhi ,"Don't stay here This hotel has one of the best designs and decors that I have ever seen. Space and light are used very well and the design of the bathroom was excellent. Design and decor on their own don't make for a great 5 star hotel. What really counts is the quality and experience of the staff and the training they have received. It was clear to me that the Grand has a long way to go in terms of it's staff being able to provide the type of service that customers who are paying high rates expect. The problems started at reception - when we arrived the receptionist had no idea of our booking despite the fact that our airline (who we booked through) had given written confirmation and a booking reference number. We were told to wait while they checked and then three different sets of managers finally agreed that they did have a booking for us. This process took an hour while we waited in reception. We had booked on a full board basis but when we finally managed to check in we were told that no meals were included. This is despite the fact that my booking voucher showed that meals were included. We were told to wait again while they checked. After another hour they couldn't resolve this so I just called up the Airline who we had booked with in London to sort it out. Within 10 minutes after the call from London the Hotel manager eventually agreed that our meals were included. If he had just read the booking form we wouldn't have had to go through the pain. But the experience was unpleasant and made us feel as though we were freeloaders when in fact everything was paid for. We ate at the main restaurant which looked fantastic but at the buffet I noticed that once a dish ran out it was not replaced. If you asked for that dish you were told that they hadn't got it anymore (hardly a 5 star response). This happened at lunch, dinner and breakfast the result being that there was a limited choice of food. To make matters worse one of the waiters managed to spill milk on me because he was trying to carry too many things at the same time and couldn't manage. Checking out was very stressful - Clearly the previous manager had not told the reception staff that we had already paid in advance. So we were presented with a bill for accommodation and food. I then had to repeat the whole process of explanations to another set of staff which was not only annoying but time consuming as well. The location of the Grand is very poor. The hotel is 30 mins from the Airport but there are no tourist facilities around it. For the same price you could stay at a more customer friendly hotel located in central Delhi such as Oberoi or Taj. My advice to the Grand is; if you charge 5 star prices make sure your staff are able to deliver the service. Would I stay here again - Never. "
the grand new delhi ,"The Grand New Delhi (dishonest pricing) If you want to be ripped off and cheated stay here!, We stayed in this hotel on two occasion. On the first stay, we were charge £120 a night + tax (locals get charge 20% of this rate only!, as i found out at check out!) (you are asked for your passort before any rates are given not only in this hotel, but in any hotel in india, if you are a indian national you pay around 20/30% of what foreigners pay.)one the 2nd occasion were were charge £210 a night for the same room , reason they gave was that they had decided to rename the rooms from deuxle rooms to Club rooms and this was the reason for the increase! after a long conversation with the unprofessionals duty manager - we realised that all the rooms the the hotel are the same and you get charge a different amount depending which floor you are on!!!!!we asked for a room on the ground floor but they said they were fully booked, which was a totally lie as the hotel was empty and rooms were being decorated as I realised when i walked around. Also on the 2nd occasion, inculded in this &quot;club price&quot; was collection from the airport however no one turned up and we had to make our own why there and pay for a taxis and when we asked for our money back they refused! only in india this would happen. The hotel is of 5* star quality nice gardens and food, (when the ovens are working) however the lack of accountability and the lack of honestly on room prices, means i would never stay here again, we had no choice as we were going home the next day and could not find anywere else at sush short notice. Never stay here , unless you like to be ripped off. "
the grand new delhi ,"Excellent value for Money I spent 4 nights at the Grand Delhi in late 2004. Overall, given the price I paid (US$80/night) I was impressed, given a similar property in downtown Delhi would have cost US$200+. However, after 4 nights I had enough of the place, and changed to the Intercontinental. I was much happier at the Intercontinental because we were able to walk around the city, go back to the hotel to refresh, continue walking etc.If you are a tourist I would NOT stay at the Grand unless you are in transit and wish to be close to the airport. The location in the middle of nowhere is really depressing. You will be much happier in downtown Delhi where there is much more atmosphere.Overall:Good points:* Price* Very large and modern rooms* Stylish bathrooms* Beautiful and spacious lobby and public areasBad points:* Service is simply terrible. The staff do not speak English at all well. They are incredibly slow to respond to housekeeping requests. We waited over an hour for them to bring something to our room. The people at the front desk were inexperienced, slow, unhelpful and rude.* Once past the lobby and grounds, the public areas are very worn. For instance, the hallways leading to the room feature filthy walls, stained carpet and drab lighting.* While still stylish, the rooms are showing definite signs of ageing, e.g. dirty curtains, stained carpet, chipped and damaged furniture.* The bathroom is without question the slipperiest I have ever experienced. The problem is it is an open shower, and the combination of the black marble and deluge of water, creates something akin to black ice on the floor. Be very careful.* As others have advised, the location is quite useless if you want to see anything in downtown Delhi. By taxi Delhi is 40 minutes away in good traffic, a lot more in bad traffic.* The restaurants are extremely over-priced by India standards. This compounded with the fact that you are literally in the middle of nowhere, means you will be forced to dine at these establishments from time to time.* The quality of the buffet breakfast is quite poor. The service of the staff is even worse. I will never forget how rude the chef who cooked the eggs was. He would just growl at people and shove the food at them. The only positive is the location by the pool. "
the grand new delhi ,"Best deal for a 5-star hotel in New Delhi I stayed at the Grand New Delhi from June 5-11, 2006. I thought this place was excellent. I have stayed at many luxury hotels and this certainly ranks up there with the rest. The pool in the back is excellent. My goal was to try to find a 5-star hotel in New Delhi for around $120 a night. I was warned not to get anything less than a 5-star hotel in India if I wanted anything decent. I paid $129 a night thru Expedia. which I thought was affordable for 6 nights. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is their room service food is sub-par for a luxury hotel. And also its not a great location except that it is close to the airport if you want to get there quickly. However, it's in a quiet area if this is what you are looking for and besides, if you want a luxury hotel in New Delhi in the downtown area you will be paying a small fortune. This was a great deal. "
the grand new delhi ,"Grand New Delhi I dont know why some of the reviews are so negative towards this place. IT s one of the best hotels near the airport. Well kept, clean, and the rooms and room bathrooms are very stylish and upscale with black marble and open stand up shower. The service is average at times, but that is probably because it is suck a large hotel with over 350 rooms. The breakfast buffet is mediocre though has much variety. I liked the price best about this hotel, I paid somewhere around $130USD per night.... This is an ex Hyatt hotel, so even though they have change dtheir name to the Grand, they have still kept their franchise standards. I reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a clean comfortable hotel to stay at. "
the grand new delhi ,Nice hotel but...... It is a very beautifull hotel but the service is slow (at best) and they have the most uncomfortable beds that i have ever slept (or tried to sleep) in. It was like sleeping on a rock and i woke up with severe backache. For this reason i dont think i will be returning the hotel which is a shame as it has such potential.

the hans new delhi ,"Good hotel but be aware Stayed here for 2 nights, very impressed, then came back for another 3 nights .... Disgusted to pay for a Deluxe room and be given a very average room. On complaining was upgraded back to what we were in previously, and had paid for....... Best floors to be on are 19 and 20. Rooms are comfortable and airy. Housekeeping staff are wonderfully friendly and if you get the right waiters in the restaurant, make eating a pleasure. Food is very good and menu is varied. No tummy complaints !! "
the hans new delhi ,"Excellent Service with centralised location Hi, I have booked the executive room and was given an upgrade to their deluxe rooms. 1st impression upon entering the room was that the photo shown in the hotel website under 'rooms' was entirely different and I was very dissapointed with it. Secondly, as I arrived at local time 11pm, I requested for an ironing board and was given a very old, dirty looking, rusty ironing board. Shock no.2. Worse thing is they say I can't even keep it for a night as that's the only ironing board they have. So ended up, I got them to take it back and send it to me in the morning. Luckily, this time round, I was presented with a much better ironing board, else I can't imagine myself using it. This hotel provides excellent service especially the cafe staff at level 2. The coffee at the breakfast was bad as they explained that they are using Nescafe powder, no coffee aroma and tastes funny. Yaswant at the cafe ended up brewing some good coffee for me with the hotel's coffee beans and I was impressed by the extra mile he went for me at no cost. Feel if the hotel is positioning itself as a business hotel, the coffee standard is extremely important, I have taken up the hotel package which is a great deal with complimentary 1-way airport transfer and breakfast and dinner. Do note that the bill will be chargeable in Rupee according to the exchange rate. This hotel is also 5-10mins walking distance to Connaught Place. "
the hans new delhi ,"Disgusting. Staff are exceptional nice though. What a disappointment. The rooms advertised on the internet are not what you get when you arrive. We stayed on the 10th floor and was so disappointed that we checked out the following day (we were supposed to stay for 3 nights). The bar and restaurant are of good standard. The reception is also of a good standard but the rooms are diabolical.When asked to see another another room on the grounds that I was unhappy about the standard, the staff were only too keen in offering up another room, which I might add was of a dismal standard. So in summary, rooms are disgusting and staff are exceptional. It's a shame. "
the hans new delhi ,"Nice and pleasant stay Rooms were clean, reception and room services were good. Would recommend this for stay "
the hans new delhi ,"Not for long stays This hotel looks okay on first appearances - modern, clean lobby, but then you have to take a lift to the 16th floor to get to the first level of rooms!Room was a little small and noisy at night as it was next to the lift (elevator) shaft! Also, the adjoining door to the next room must have been wafer thin as I could hear absolutely every word from next door! "
the hans new delhi ,Good Over all expereince was Good. Staff hospitality was great. Location is very good. Rooms were well maintained &amp; spacious. Good choice for the official business travellers like us. Food was average. But overall Good value for money. Would like to stay agai &amp; recommand to others too. 
the hans new delhi ,"Solid 3-star near Connaught Place Nice room with wood &amp; marble floors. Within short walk of Connaught Place shops (if that's of interest), about 40 mins. from airport. Combo hotel and office building.Breakfast selection was wide and very good. Pleasant staff.Negatives were small: hard bed, some amenities (e.g., lotion) were not replaced from previous occupant. "
the hans new delhi ,"Value for money I like this hotel for its value for money.On my company's business trips, I stayed in this hotel several times and had recommended others including foreign guests .Rooms are well appointed and adequately big so as to be comfortable. Brake fast is included in the package and with sufficient spreads to take care for a good day.For tourists, it is excellent value for money with all amenities and located at a convenient place from allconsiderations.I "
the hans new delhi ,"Just a good business hotel We spent 4 nights at Hans Plaza Hotel and I've to say we weren't impressed by the experience there. Key points: - Location is good, 20min walking distance from Connaught Place and 5min close to Delhi Metro (which does not connect the modern centre of New Delhi). - Rooms are OK, they're exactly what you expect from a 4**** business hotel. They're modern, clean and functional, no frills no atmosphere. Beds are hard and rigid, not relaxing at all. As usual we didn't even consider to purchase items from the room minibar, overpriced as everywhere in India. Two 500ml bottles of purified water are complimentary in the room but we managed to get extra free bottles at the concierge's just asking them if we could &quot;purchase&quot; water from the lobby bar. They kindly handed over the bottles for free. - Staff is overall friendly and professional, nothing special. - Prices are high, approx 5500 rupees for a std double room (considered &quot;executive&quot; because it was at the 19th floor with good distance from the noisy roads around the hotel). - Our breakfast was included in the room price and we enjoyed it at the fullest, good food with the notable exception of tea which was of extremely poor quality (we had to suffer it 4 mornings). - We happened to have lunch in the hotel restaurant, good food but again overpriced - sadly not other restaurants in the 5min radius. - Business centre is just ridiculous with just 1 computer available for guests (we had to queue), prices are 50 rupees for 30min !!!!Overall a decent stay, but clearly next time we'll go somewhere else. "
the hans new delhi ,"Exorbitant and Rip Off The room is moderate. But there is no plug points to charge laptop and cell phones. I had to remove the plug of a lamp to charge my laptop. Do not buy food or drinks from this hotel. Though it's not even a two star hotel, the price for a normal mineral water is Rs.200/- (the actual price is Rs.10/- only). 2 boiled eggs can cost you Rs.350/- plus taxes!!! A total rip off!!! Don't get traumatized by the bills. "
the imperial ,"Best Hotel We Have Ever Stayed in !! WOW !!! What a fantastic hotel. Warm welcome from staff on arrival . Room was everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel, large room with dressing room and large bathroom. Furnishings were of top quality. Staff were always helpful and courteous and could not do enough for you from the maid to the hotel manager. The hotel is like stepping back in time with its impressive lobby and seating area. Every floor of the hotel is like walking through an art gallery with numerous pieces of art, its well worth going for a wander and checking them out. The staff are dressed in uniforms similar to those that would have been worn in the colonial era. The atrium is impressive and the ideal place to relax and have afternoon tea. The hotel pool is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Exceptional We stayed for a couple of nights at the beginning of the month and when we checked in they had upgraded us from the basic room to a junior suite. The room /s were perfect but since we didnt need or use the sitting room, dressing room &amp; spare bathroom, Im not sure Id pay for if we go back to delhi. The highlights were; the hotel itself which is immaculate, the incredible staff, the most beautiful pool, the location (a short walk from connaught pl, and next to the Tibetan market) &amp; the sheer joy of staying in a non corporate/chain hotel. We went to the spice route and had a good dinner. Ignore the guide books and go for an indoor table, also, it is expensive and be warned the food is more asian than indian, but if you are staying and cant be bothered to go out - you wont be dissapointed. The second night we went to Bukhara - and HATED it! Firstly its in the sheraton which is an ugly airport style hotel (45 mins away)and the restaurant is like being in a flintstones theme park. There is no cutlery - the seating is on tree trunk stools and the tables are slightly bigger tree trunks - neither having been hollowed out - theres nowhere to put your legs. The food was quite good but no better than every other restauarant we subsequently visiited on our trip - and it cost over £200 with a cheap bottle of wine 2 starters and 2 mains.We really liked delhi and loved staying at the hotel which provided a welcome peaceful escape from the mayhem of old and the bustle of new delhi.. "
the imperial ,"well too overpriced Don't mind the big name and historical background : this hotel is way too pretentious and overpriced. The hotel management still live in a dream and is not aware that the city has changed : you can now find jus as good middle-range places to stay, with the same comfort, reasonably priced services and even more modern facilities. Though the service remains friendly there and the rooms comfortable and beautifully decorated, it is difficult to understand why they charge so much. Why is an ordinary Wifi connection charged 200 Rs every 30 mns ? Why has the price of the Sunday buffet tripled or more over the last few years to reach at least 2000 Rs each (drinks extra) for ridiculously small shares of food ? Why having a simple drink in the Atrium has got so expensive ? Watch out in 2010 : after the Commonwealth Games rush, no one will be able to afford a room or even a drink in this place. An other problem is that the staff doesn't know the difference between being helpful and intrusive. If you just feel like a cup of tea, they'll insist on you having expensive cakes with it (they are trained to be more commercial, I guess). If you want to work quietly in your room, keep the 'don't diisturb' tag on the door all time, as the roomkeeping staff would ring any time to offer some service, leaving you the nasty impression that you're just taken for a tip cash machine. Some would even follow you in the corridors to help you open your room door (thanks, I can manage with my key …). Too much attention also means less privacy and you sometimes feel you're being « watched » all the time. Last detail: avoid the rooms opposite the fitness room if you don't want to wake up early in the morning at the sound of loud-speaking staff and customers gathering there. On the whole, I would advise to forget about staying there and just afford a meal in one of the restaurants some time when in Delhi. Not more: you can find beautiful guest houses/ hotels in the city now with nice gardens, free Wifi and nice rooftop restaurants... "
the imperial ,"Beautiful but stuffy The atmosphere at The Imperial is a bit stuffy for my taste. I love opulence but only when it is accompanied by a warm, friendly atmosphere. The fact that they wanted to charge me for a whole day for an early checkin was shocking. I liked the size of the hotel, not too big that you get lost. The food was outstanding and restaurant service very attentive. "
the imperial ,Best hotel in the World I've been there several times during my year in India. It's a very refreshing hotel in the middle of the town. The staff is very professional and have high standards of client service. I invite people to spend some time to see all the wonderful art museum that this hotel is and to invite family and friends to the brunches or to other special events !they do amazing deserts! 
the imperial ,"Overrated We were very dissapointed with the Imperial. It felt to us like a big impersonal commercial hotel... The room (we were upgraded to a junior suite) was lovely with all the comforts,size and amenities one could have wanted with one big problem, the two windows faced directly into walls a couple of feet from the windows. According to the desk manager only the regular rooms face the atrium. If you look from the outside at the configuration I doubt if very mmany rooms have any view. The staff were fine, except we wanted to take the tour of the art collection, but they couldn't be bothered getting back to us with a time.The Spice Garden restaurant was excellentOur last time in Dehli we stayed at the Oberoi which I would recommend over the Imperial, except the Imperial location is somewhat better . "
the imperial ,"Historical Grandeur which does not disappoint Stayed at this incredible hotel for sadly just 2 nights.Stayed in a heritage suite. Unbelievable. The ceilings towered above the vast sitting room and large bedroom. Beautiful furniture and the rooms are all so cool in white. Historic pictures on the wall. The bed was just perfect and the bedding so luxurious. No outdoor facing windows but who cares when your room looks onto fountain courtyards. The staff could have not been more helpful nothing was too much problem and the guide the hotel found to take my me and my partner around old Delhi was tour guide to Presidents and Kings. Excellent. The hotel even laid the hotel car on which was extremely comfortable and rather grand with the hotels logo emblazened on the side. Security at the hotel is very tight with bags and luggage screened on arrival. Never been at a hotel that not only checks under all cars coming into the hotel drive (including their own) but one has to pass through a metal detector to get into the hotel. Room service was efficient. The phone,as promised,was answered almost immediately. There are simply so many places to eat in the hotel that one was disappointed that one was invited out for dinner and so lost a valuable night of trying out the hotels various eateries. We tried the 1911 restaurant for dinner which is a wonderfully historic room. I had a curry but my fiance went for some Australian lamb chops. London prices I afraid and almost 4 times the cost of my curry. So beware. There is the beautifully decorated spice route restaurant which I was sad we had no time to try. Apparently it took 7 years to decorate in natural colours. I did however get an opportunity to try the beautiful pool which was refreshing as it was spectacular. Breakfast is a real treat. A trail of delights are on offer from curry to pain au chocolat; banana smoothies to green tea. Take it outside on the famous terrace overlooking the hotel lawns. The hussle and bussle of Delhi can be heard beyond the tranqui heaven that greets one.It was here the partition of India was worked out in 1947. How often can a breakfast venue have that claim to fame. The staff even in the morning are there to assist as best they can. This hotel is a seriously grown up hotel and not aplace for back packers. It deserves the same respect as the very best of European hotels. Try it though if you are on a budget it might not be the place for you. One cannot help by feel somewhat superior as one passes the other delux hotels of Delhi for none have the majesty of the Imperial "
the imperial ,"Great Service I have visited Delhi last month. It is one of the most memorable tours in my life. When I reached Delhi flying down from my country, I felt the warm spirit of the city. The tree-lined roads first surprised me. I thought it as a city of concrete building, but it vanished when I saw lines of trees on the Delhi roads. I traveled Delhi for a business purpose. After completing my business works, I enjoyed a day-long tour. Really it was nice! I hang out at the India Gate in one evening till 10 am and it was an amazing place. I toured Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar, Red Fort, Chandi Chowk market, Jama Masjid, and many more. I enjoyed a Bollywood movie at a PVR. I ate at some very good restaurants. The typical Indian food is a little bit spicy, but tasty a lot. At this Indian city, I have seen so many European scenes "
the imperial ,"unbelievable stayed here for 3 weeks in june 2007 and this hotel is amazing. food was great, accommodation was great, staff were great and friendly. except i had money taken from my room and i reckon i know it was a staff cleaner. he basically brought it to my attention. i did nt. pursue as he obviously needed it more than i did. but to stay at this place is a must. a bit pricey but well worth it. the porters out the front were good craic and the 1911 bar was home away from home. the spice route has some fine cuisine and the pool is a great place to relax and listen to the world go by on janpath over the fence. breakfast is also brilliant "
the imperial ,"Flawless We spent one and a half days in the Imperial after a 2 week trip around Rajasthan. Our short stay here was the icing on the cake of what was one of our best trips ever.Our room was beautiful and I guess particularly appealling after an 18 hour rail trip from Jaisalmer.We loved the pool and spent a large proportion of time in or around it. The food in the restuarant was good but very pricey.All the staff members we came across were utterly charming , helpful and spoke excellent English, as indeed they were in all of our other hotels in India.All in all a wonderful hotel which we would lover to re-visit one day. "
the imperial ,The Imperial I have been fortunate enough to stay here many time what a stunning hotel 
the imperial ,"Awful service stay at the Taj Having spent two weeks travelling around India on honeymoon my wife and I thought we'd stay at the Imperial for our last night. Here is what was wrong:1) Reservations had forgotten that my wife was with me and the room was set up for single occupancy. Having informed that me double occupancy incurs an extra charge, my wife and I still had to share bath robes, towels, slippers, mineral water etc.2) Reception made fuss to say that they would send us cake and flowers as it was our honeymoon - it never arrived. (We stayed at three Taj hotels over the previous 2 weeks and they each gave us a bunch of flowers, chocolates, towels in the shape of swans and a lovely smile).3) Engineering had to be called out twice as there was no hot water in the bathroom. Once at 1am and once at 8am.4) Room was freezing cold, engineer said thermostat didn't allow the room temperature to be above the outside temperature.5) Service is nothing compared to the Taj.The place relies too heavily on its reputation. The room is crammed full of advertising for its shops/services and lists of nominations for awards (just in case you come to realise it's a rip-off). Never again. "
the imperial ,"Don't waste your money We stayed here for three very forgettable nights, whilst being made feel very unwelcome. Upon check-in we were shown to our room by a mono syllabic receptionist who failed to mention anything about the hotels facilities, breakfast or location. There was some confusion about our booking which the hotel resolved in a very unstaisfactory manner, making us feel most unwelcome. The staff in general were rude and the concierge service was quiet poor - when we asked about flight confirmation, they did not bother to confirm for us and in addition provided wrong information regarding events in the city.On a positive note, the hotel itself is beautful. The rooms are large and comfortable. The pool is the most impressive we've come across - its huge with a great area for sunbathing. There is also a good gym available. This is a nice hotel in a nice location, however the staff let it down badly "
the imperial ,"Experience at Imperial Stayed there Sep. 09, check in ok, room excellent, floor staff can not fault with attention to detail. Front house staff not very friendly and it seems they need some training for this type of Hotel.Air Conditioning unable to turn down, even engineer had problem with it.Word of warning for travellers paying with credit/debit card , Hotel may charge double on your credit/debit card, and very difficult to recover the charge. "
the imperial ,"A real let down! Hotel Imperial has always been a synonym for luxury, comfort and old grandeur. Sadly enough we experienced very little of that during our stay last month. To begin with, the hotel was undergoing some maintenance work and the room they gave us was just above where the work was going on! We were truly in for a rude shock. We could just not sleep or rest in the afternoon as the workers were moving the ladders, buckets, etc and talking too loudly. You certainly do not expect this in a five star hotel. The hotel did not provide hair conditioner as part of the bathroom amenities and when we called up the housekeeping we were told that the shampoo provided by the hotel was a “two in one”! Maybe its recession time and one should get used to such tricks but we have never faced such a silly issue in other hotels including far off Taj properties in South India. On the first night the waiter forgot to get half of our room service dinner order as a result of which we had to wait and the food got cold. The waiter never bothered to offer to warm it again. So much for Imperial comfort. Similarly we did not get the room cleaned in the evening service as a result of which the mineral water was not replenished. However when we asked the housekeeping later in the night to send us the complimentary water they said that it will be charged. Again, I find it a trivial issue. Why bother about INR 100-150 when the customer is paying INR 12,000 per night. Besides, we were asking only what was a part of the evening service. In all, it left a bitter taste. Considering that we were return customers we surely did not expect this kind of service from the hotel. I will not return and not recommend this hotel to my friends and family. "
the imperial ,"Good Not Great We arrived in Delhi at midnight on the Shabati Express from Agra. It wasn’t the Shinkasen but significantly superior to Amtrak. Our excessive luggage received some appropriate disapproving looks from fellow passengers. When will we learn to minimize the trinkets &amp; souvenirs? Once again Peirce &amp; Leslie was there to rescue us with four porters in tow. The few thousand meter walk to our vehicle through the surreal chaos of night-time Delhi is one of my favorite India memories. It was wild. As we were entering the Imperial my son and our escort became quite excited. The stars of “Love Aaj Kal” passed by and gave us a friendly nod &amp; hello. My son, who had been watching Idian TV, told me they were the Brangelina of India. That’s what the Imperial is. It’s the hot-trendy (yet traditional) In Spot. The hotel is beautiful with an outstanding art collection. The public rooms echo Luytens and Busby Berkeley at their best.Check-in was quick and efficient with no standing. I’m not a fan of buffets but the breakfast spread was as varied and tasty as I could have wanted. There was a table of “Asian” fruits and every morning there were a half dozen fruits I’d never seen before. The pastries were the best I’ve ever had. The manager was constantly circulating the large rooms to make sure nothing was amiss – impressive attention to detail and service. We liked the lounge 1911. The servers were excellent, accommodating and we enjoyed talking with them.The gym was a tad small and I couldn’t see any sign of a drink or a bite to be had at the stunning pool. The front of the house at Spice Route had some attitude. Maybe they thought they were the Waverly Inn of Delhi. I cancelled our reservation and instead we enjoyed ourselves at 1911. Our Heritage Suite was very attractive and comfortable. The linens were fine and the Imperial logo was on every piece of cloth in the room. All were available for purchase in the gift store. The rooms had no view. I mean none, a wall out of one window and a pigeon perched on a high ledge out the other. The bathroom had no separate shower and the tub had a shower curtain. I hate shower curtains. It looked like half the rooms were being discretely renovated on our floor. Our suite had most likely been recently redone - quickly. When I plugged in my computer the wall plate pushed through the sheetrock. Our son deemed his room “cozy”. At least he had a sliver of a view and a glass enclosed shower.We enjoyed Delhi and the Imperial was well located to venture out. It’s a first world, capital city, 4.5 star hotel, just a notch below what you would find in NYC, London or Paris. Unfortunately we had been spoiled by Oberoi and Aman. The Imperial’s new GM should spend a few nights at the competition and see what Indian hospitality can be or he can continue to run a beautiful, In Spot that falls short of its potential. "
the imperial ,"Hotel is still fabulous I got very concerned about our stay at the Imperial, as I had heard from several people that the management of the hotel changed within the past year, and that standards had slipped. The previous manager of the Imperial is currently the manager of Raffles Singapore. So, I approached the Imperial with some trepidation. I was really pleasantly surprised. If the hotel was indeed better in years past, it must have been truly awesome, because it is a still a magnificentt place to stay.The interior of the hotel is memorable. I think the hallways are really the best of any hotel that I have ever stayed in. Marble floors and walls lined with antique prints make going to your room a wonderful and interesting experience. I learned so much just looking at the hundreds of prints on the walls. And the rooms were quite beautiful as well, with spacious showers and nice toiletries (although NO hair conditioner...one of my pet peeves....)True, our room had no view to speak of . The windows in the old part of the hotel are quite small, and as mentioned by another reviewer, there is extensive work going on one side of the Imperial. There are some shanty-type buildings outside, where workers do sleep. The hotel promised that the work would be quiet, and I would have to say that it was. And I didn't have any issues with privacy from the work area, although I was aware that there were people out there. There was extensive screening from the rooms, although this wasn't necessarily very attractive. All in all, I didn't find the work area to be an issue.After a hot day in Delhi, the Imperial's pool is quite a treat. I didn't notice fumes, as mentioned by one reviewer. There is a large generator overlooking the pool, that did make noise, but it wasn't a problem. The pool is huge with magnificent fountains and lovely gardens surrounding it. The pool is a memorable part of the Imperial experience.We made extensive use of the cars and drivers at the hotel, and found them to be excellent. One of the drivers took us to Agra, and if you are familiar with Indian roads, you will know that this is quite a wild trip in some respects. In Agra, there is almost no adherence to any traffic laws. The Imperial's driver was great, and made us feel very safe in the midst of the lawlessness!Also, the concierge at the hotel got us a tour guide for Delhi with about 45 minutes lead time. The guide was incredible, with a master's degree in history. Such an intelligent and knowledgeable guy.....I was impressed that the Imperial could get hold of someone like that with such short notice, and at a very moderate price. So we were impressed by the concierge service at the hotel.Oh, and the breakfast buffet at the Imperial in the 1911 restaurant is fantastic. Lots of variety of high quality food in a stunning setting. Don't miss it!So, I would have to say that our stay at the Imerial was quite exceptional in many respects. I mean, why stay in the bland 60s style box hotels in New Delhi when you can stay in this historic and elegant place. The only other place in Delhi I would be tempted to stay is the Aman, and that just didn't work as well for our party this time. Imperial all the way. "
the imperial ,"Classic and Elegant We had the privelege of ending our India tour at the Colonial Hotel. We were pleased to be upgraded to a suite. The suite was classic in furnshings and had a wonderful bathroom. There was no view, but I believe that is true of all the rooms due to it's location.The pool was a nice place to relax, however noxious fumes from the gas station next door was often in the air.The Italian restaurant was first rate, whereas the Silk Road restaurant served mediocre cuisine. All the bars are very interesting and unique in their own style. "
the imperial ,"Amazing We stayed at the Imperial twice, when we first touched down in India and when we were due to leave, and I must say that this hotel is simply magnificent. An oasis of peace in the center of crazy Delhi with a great mixture of colonial style with ultra modern chic.The rooms were amazing, and the staff managed a perfect level of service, being present whenever needed without the usual intrusiveness that we found in other hotels in India...The pool was fantastic and the cocktails divine and high tea is an absolute must!To cap it all, they noticed it was my partners birthday and left a surprise cake in the room (giving me total kudos!).

the imperial ,"stylish and sophisticated Beautiful place in the shopping/entertaintment area, close to Conaught place (restoraunts, fast food, shopping, cinemas). "
the imperial ,"Amazing - Simply perfect One of the best experience I've ever had in a big city. So quiet compare with the overexciting athmosphere of the street. And so luxury with one of the best Thai restaurant inside. Expensive like any other 5 stars luxury, but real great experience. "
the imperial ,"disgrace to the word luxury Please avoid this hotel; it is indeed a disgrace to the world luxury. Its very expensive in terms of internet, meal and room facilities--its got bad water from drying river Yamuna, not been filtered and part of feces were seen in the sink water. STD calls are way more expensive than what another hotel would charge. Staff is polite, but they are helpless. The walls are plastered with photos etc. claiming to be historical ones, however they are artificially produced and are misleading in character and its veracity. The meals are very very poor quality. Ordered Indian food, it was very poorly made and was tasteless, as the flour they used was not of good quality. Please avoid this place "
the imperial ,"Solid hotel if you get upgraded rooms. Stayed at The Imperial twice in 5 days. The first stay got upgraded to a Heritage Room which was spacious and well equipped... decent size bathroom. The second stay got an art deco room which was half of the size of Heritage Room... that's when all the problems started. First call was to fix the lukewarm water from the shower. Second call was for someone to get rid of the mosquitos flying around the room. They came in and sprayed insecticide into room which made the room smelled. So, overall, the experience at The Imperial was very uneven. "
the imperial ,Watch out for touts when you leave the hotel on foot When you walk out the gate of the hotel to look at the shops on Jan Path road or go to the emporium handicraft house right across the road there will be rickshaw drivers hassling you and sending you deliberately in the wrong direction so they can get commission by &quot;helping&quot; you find the right store.Ignore them and be firm. They can be quite overwhelming and even aggressive. If you can't shake them just shout out for one of the several guards standing at the gate of the hotel.I mention this because my wife fell for the scheme and was taken to some obscure shop several blocks away. A potential hazard ! 
the imperial ,"Poorly managed property with wasted potential This property has beautiful artwork, a great breakfast buffet, a good swimming pool, friendly people to welcome you at the front door, and that's about it. It fancies itself as a world class hotel, but it cheaps it out at every corner. From excessive internet charges (when the wireless doesn't even work with Dell computers...huh??) to maintenance work in the main hallway in the middle of the day, The Imperial does not know how to make a guest feel at home. My wife and I arrived to find that the booking we thought we'd made online, incl. wireless, airport transfers, and breakfast, was actually something -- room only. Not only that, we were stuck in a tiny corner room overlooking a construction site/tent village where workers were looking up into our room. There was also a hanging lamp that was about to fall out from a rotted hole in the ceiling. When we asked to be moved, we were told that we could not, even though another employee had told us the hotel was only half full. The location of the hotel is also hardly serene. On the first night, I wanted to take out cash from an ATM, which the hotel did not have. I was told by the front desk to walk a couple hundred yards to the nearest one. When I walked out the front gate, I was immediately stepping over dozens of people lying on the sidewalks. Meanwhile, the numerous hotel security guards at the gates just looked at me dumbfoundedly without thinking to point me in the right direction or warn me that it might not be a great idea. There are plenty of other luxury hotels to choose from in New Delhi, so stay away from the Imperial. It is hard to feel resentful at a place as beautiful as The Imperial, but somehow management has figured out how to make that happen. "
the imperial ,"Excellent hotel best staff Great hotel, impeccable decor and beautiful rooms. Staff are all excellent, friendly and efficient. Have stayed 6 times in past year and it gets better. Gym could be better. Pool is excellent as is location. "
the imperial ,"nicest hotel I have every stayed in Lovely lovely hotel, everything about it was amazing. I think the pool was my favorite part-amazing saline pool, really amazing. The rooms, service and decor hotelwide was such a treat and the brunch was out of this world. Totally a decadent treat to be able to stay here. The location was great, just down the block from CP and across the street from the cottage industry emporium. Great shopping. I loved Delhi a beautiful city, well planned out and full of sights, sounds and shopping delights. I loved the whole experience. Cannot wait to go back. "
the imperial ,"terrible service My husband and i stayed at this hotel a few months ago and were quite disappointed with the level of service both at check-in and breakfast. The hotel's common areas are beautiful and unique but somehow this does not make up for the aloof attitude of the staff. The waiters at breakfast were very slow and took more than 10 minutes to even hand out the menus and sometimes they did not even do so and we had to ask for the menus several times. We saw other guests complaining on this also. We regularly stay in five star hotels in India and around the world (Oberoi - where service is excellent), Taj, Park Hyatt, Ritz, Plaza Athenee etc) and for us this level of service is simply unacceptable . The rooms are ok except for the bathrooms which are not up to five star standard. The Spice restaurant was of a decent standard but was not up to expectations. "
the imperial ,"Gorgeous luxury hotel - highly recommended This really is a beautiful hotel. The pubic areas are stunning and everywhere you go you can smell jasmine.We stayed on two separate occassions, once while we were on business and the second time on our return from a tour of the Golden Triangle which was organised through Castle and King Inc, based in New Delhi and they were excellent. It was Castle and King who recommended The Imperial to us.On the first stay we were in a Heritage Room, it was very large and elegant. I loved the soft quilted slippers and crisp crested bedlinen. We had drinks in the Atrium and although not cheap were generous and the nuts and nibbles were frequently topped up (so unlike hotels in England). We had dinner in The Spice Route which was excellent and the service very good. Despite our Indian business associates telling us not to order Indian wine, we did and the white especialy was very palletable.I went for an early morning swim (at 7am) in the pool and it lovely, the beds were already out and the pool attendant was attentive without being intrusive.On our second stay we stayed in a Deco Suite which was also lovely, the only thing was the floor was in the process of being decorated and the gorgeous smell of Jasmine was over powered by the awful smell of paint. As we were only there for one night it didn't matter much though.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - it is steeped in history and is quite stunning. I have stayed in many lovely hotels but this (and the Rambugh Palace in Jaipur) are my favourites.I would go back in a shot. "
the imperial ,"Colonial Style! The Imperial New Delhi is a fantastic sanctuary in a dirty messy and sad city.....As soon as the gate closed behind us we could relax, and checked in to very comfortable rooms with all the necessary amenities.The style of the hotel is true colonial, with a 1920`s decor. You really feel set back in time at the hotel, and everything is well maintained. The lunch buffet at the hotel was one of the best ever, with a fantastic choice of salads, charcutterie, bread, and all kinds of cakes and dessert!!! We sat outside on the terrace, very stylish! Only &quot;drawback&quot; is the view over the street, with the very sad Indian streetlife..... But I guess that is a part of New Delhi you have to deal with...All in all, a perfect place for a &quot;hideaway&quot; from New Delhi, in New Delhi....! "
the imperial ,"Classy and stylish - a true Jewel in the Crown Prepare to take a trip back in time and enjoy delightful service and an amazing colonial decor. The hotel pays so much attention to detail, it really shows. Fresh flowers everywhere, and a nice scent with aromatic oils in all the hallways. Room incredibly comfortable and classy. Wide array of restaurants and bars, I had lunch at 1911, very good, and dinner at the Spice Route (for all the hype surrounding it, I wasn't too impressed). Only downside: it doesn't have a spa.In short: lovely, luxurious hotel, a real oasis. "
the imperial ,"oasis of calm but not while we were there luxury hotel in centre of delhi. Excellent service and wonderful art. Indian restaurant was superb, buffet breakfast OK. Our real problem was the development work outside our window. we had to change rooms in the middle of the night because of it. However, the hotel management acted quickly and efficiently to put things right "
the imperial ,"Great hotel but here's some advice I'm not going to bore you with details of how good this hotel, as everyone else have already done this for me. Instead here's a little bit of advice.1. Don't bother to book a hotel car through hotel reception. All the drivers will ferry you around privately (in luxury hotel cars) for half the price if asked (10 quid an hour)2. If you travel to the Taj Mahal in a hotel car, don't bother to pay for a packed lunch. While the food is fantastic quality, they don't put it on ice in the boot of the car. By lunch time it's red hot. And hot smoked salmon isn't a good idea!3. Daniel's Tavern is a great curry house, do don't be put off by the name.4. The hotel bar does a great White Russian.5. Every hotel driver we used (whether they be in a Mercedes or a green, yellow and black Hindustan) work for commission. If you buy something in a shop that they take you to, they get a cut. That's fine in principal, but the problem is that the places they take you to charge twice as much as everywhere else. 6. If you give money to a beggar through your car window, the car will suddenly get swamped with more beggars. Very disturbing! "
the imperial ,"Truly excellent! My room rate included transfers from the airport to hotel. When we arrived at the hotel we were met at the entrance and escorted to Reception, where the receptionist already had the check-in paperwork waiting. This initial experience was typical of the first rate service that we received throughout our stay. Staff tried to anticipate our needs as well as complying quickly with any request we made. The same desire to anticipate every need was evident in the room, which was immaculate. The public areas are also beautifully maintained. The food is also wonderful, particularly in 1911 (one of the restaurants). There is a small internal courtyard in front of the Spice Route and Daniell's restaurants where drinks are served and which is a wonderful place to relax. I went to New Delhi on business but will definitely return to the Imperial for a holiday. "
the imperial ,"Loved the property The hotel is is in the heart of the city.....to start with. It has a beautiful propoerty that reminds you of the English era, the food is awesome and the service is unbeatable. I will reccomned this to all....... "
the imperial ,"The place to stay in Delhi... if you have money! We stayed in the Imperial as a treat as it was our last stop before returning home from our travels. It was way above what we would normally spend on a hotel and I was a little anxious about the expense.And it is a lot of money. But at the same time, it is considerably cheaper than its equivalents in Western capitals. Everything is so well finished - the lobby, the rooms and the dining areas are all immaculate and have an understated elegance. The service is exemplary, from the moment the door is opened from you and your bags are taken by the bellhop, to the people on reception and in the dining areas. We had breakfast included and this covered a very wide variety of foods, including surprisingly good pastries, lots of different fruits and the usual made to order egg station. I was also pleased as we were upgraded from a room to a suite. The suite was lovely, with two widescreen TVs and two bathrooms. The whole experience made you feel special and pampered, and if this is what you're looking for the Imperial is the place to be. "
the imperial ,"Loved the scent Just too good fragrance all around ,it gives a perfect environment to relax.Food too good one needs to try the prawns dishes,i also liked the gazals that were played.Rooms very relaxing and just perfect to stay.The surrondings and shops also quite good "
the imperial ,"A beautiful hotel A stately hotel with an impressive facade and interiors. Lovely rooms, great pool, breakfast! "
the imperial ,"Best Hotel I had stayed with Imperial a couple of times. I visit Delhi freqquently for official work. The property is just great, rooms are superb.good service..would recommend all. "
the imperial ,"Gorgeous gracious retreat in a perfect central location We stayed in an Imperial room (the lowest room category) for three nights in May. The hotel is not inexpensive, but with a discounted internet rate we felt it was very good value for money. Pros: Central location, yet peaceful. Gorgeous public spaces and facilities, from restaurants and bars to pool. Spacious room with high ceiling, beautiful decor, large dressing area and nary a peep from the neighbors. Generous bathroom amenities, complimentary bottled water and fresh fruit renewed each day. Great housekeeping. Great breakfast buffet. Superb, friendly service from airport pickup to front desk and porters to the rest of the vast staff that keeps a place like this running seamlessly at all times. Cons: Not one that I can think of! India is wonderful but sometimes challenging for a Western visitor. After a long block of sightseeing, coming back to the Imperial was like exhaling deeply; there, everything is easy! Every little request was taken care of immediately and with good cheer; everything is beautifully maintained and scented with jasmine; the a.c. (backed up by what must be an enormous generator) works wonders even when others in the city are suffering power outages. Best of all, though, were the staff. Other hotels seem to struggle to strike the right note with service. The Imperial delivered the perfect balance of solicitude without obsequiousness; correctness without overformality or snobbishness; total warmth and grace. And they made it look effortless! We will definitely return. "
the imperial ,"Fragrant luxury in the heart of Delhi We visited the property for two nights in December a couple of weeks after the Mumbai attacks. Christmas parties were in full swing and the security was cursory and shambolic. However the first impression on entering the lobby is of a luxurious fragrant oasis in the heart of the city. The rooms are comfortable, there are plenty of dining choices (the children enjoyed the Italian restaurant) and the pool looks inviting. I would go back but would prefer a more thorough security process such as those adopted by the hotel chains caught up in the attacks. "
the imperial ,"Opulence at its best! As always, The Imperial Hotel in Delhi sets the standards for hotel industries world wide!! We travel a lot all over the world, and this hotel still remains our most favourite of places to stay for quality, staff, service, opulence and well being. Although pricey for some, at US$200 per night, it is reasonably priced for five star service in India and everything is awe inspiring! The staff are long term employees who know how to provide for your every need and go out of their way to make you feel special. From arriving at the entrance where their uniforms take you back to the Maharajas, to walking through the foyer where the flower displays (changed fortnightly) are artistic creations and found throughout the hotel, but the most impressive of all is the marble flooring - stunning patterns and immaculate tiling! The British Colonialism oozes of early 1900s with photos adorning all walls of those days - the history is amazing. You walk the corridors feeling as if you are part of that era. The artwork on the stairwells and passageways to the rooms keep you entertained every time you pass by, and the furniture down the corridors are of the time and place gone by. All rooms are opulence with class, and the fine Victorian styled decor sets it apart from the rest. It is always a pleasure to return to this hotel - whether for a meal (although expensive!) with a wide choice of restaurants, to stroll the gardens and corridors, or to just lap up the luxury of a top class hotel with impeccable service, smiles and to live the era of the 1900s, time after time! "
the imperial ,"The Imperial - one of the best hotels in the world My wife and I stayed at the Imperial for one night at the start of our two week tour of Rajasthan. Having stayed there on business for a couple of weeks in 2007, I was keen that my wife experience the Imperial's elegance and service and it didn't disappoint. Everything from the hotel pick-up to the breakfast selection was excellent and although drinks prices are expensive they are no more than you expect from a 5 star hotel.The Imperial is also very well located with the main Delhi 'cottage industries' emporium directly opposite (you just have to brave the taxi drivers outside the hotel who tell you it's closed!). I recommend Chor Bizarre for an evening meal (in Old Delhi at the Hotel Broadway and has excellent North Indian Food) and Dilli Haat for a slightly touristy but nonetheless enjoyable shopping experience - the fact that there's a small entrance fee means you aren't pestered by touts and beggars. "
the imperial ,"Declined since last visit I stayed here a couple of years ago and loved it but this time it just wasn't as great. The concierge was ok but not particularly helpful whereas last time he couldn't do enough for us and was excellent at helping us plan our stay. The room &quot;overlooking the pool&quot; was in fact looking at trees (which if you looked carefully enough you could glimpse the pool) and a building site. The bathroom which is huge had no separate shower and the cleaning wasn't that great - the toilet needed a good scrub! Dinner at 1911 was fine but nothing special and the cocktails in the bar weren't great at all. It also lacked much atmosphere which is very different to my last visit. One thing to point out that I didn't really focus on last time was the &quot;spa&quot;. It's not a spa, it's a hair salon that does manicures and pedicures and has a storage room that doubles for a treatment room if you want a massage. It's very old and dated and grubby - the foot massage and pedicures are very good though - and not at all like a relaxing spa that you might imagine in such a hotel. Overall it's still a good hotel but standards seem to have slipped somewhat "
the imperial ,"Pure luxury! I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my wife and son. We had a really good time, and we enjoyed really ourselves. The hotel is one of the bests options of accomodations in Delhi, beacause it is a colonial style, perfect for staying in India.The room was absolutely perfect, very clean and very big. We had shower and bath. Also, we had breakfast which was quite good.If I went back to Delhi, I would go to the imperial, without any doubt. "
the imperial ,lovely i stayed at the imperial with my son and friend and enjoyed it very much...we were given jr. suites as an upgrade..they were lovely..very charming..well done...the hotel has alot of beautiful paintings and drawings of india which are wonderful to look at..the staff was very good...the pool was a nice place to be after the busy city life...we enjoyed the restaurants also..very good food... 
the imperial ,excellent hotel excellent location a really good hotel with everything you could want. Not quite as stunning as the Rambaugh Palace or the Oberoi Amarvillas but extrmely good for a city centre hotel. The hotel tour is well worth taking - lots of history. The location is perfecty - half way between Caunaught Place and India Gate. The business centre is efficient although the internet connection is a bit slow. Food was terrific and the service was excellent - a great refuge from the hustle of Delhi - the only place in Indai where a tip was refused!!The only downside was that the swimming pool area wasn't the most attractive and got a bit crowded in the late afternoon. 
the imperial ,"Quite simply stunning I have stayed at The Imperial a number of times and it is quite simply one of the most stunning hotels I have ever set foot in. The service is impreccable, as is the hotel, its surroundings and food. It has one of the best restaurants in the world (The Spice Route) as well as one of the most lavish bars (I would recommend pre dinner sundowners on the lawns). If you can drag yourself away from the hotel you'll find that it is centrally located for one of Delhi's most pretigious shopping districts (Cannought Place). There is also a shopping emporium across the road from the hotel which is well worth a visit. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough. "
the imperial ,"Wonderful hotel This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. Everything gleams and there is a lovely jasmine scent everywhere. They upgraded us one category (from the basic Imperial room to a Heritage room) and it was gorgeous. Exactly like in the hotel's photos (in fact it was even better! ) and how often can you say that ? Room #30 was spacious enough that I don't think there is any need to book a suite. Yes, there was no view and the fruit plate was tiny, but that's about it for the negatives. The hotel is an amazing museum of art from the East India Company period, and we thoroughly enjoyed strolling the corridors viewing the many pictures. The Spice Route restaurant is fabulous to see, but I didn't find the food particularly special (but then, we have great Asian food in Vancouver). The buffet breakfast in the 1911 restaurant was fine, and not expensive for a 5* hotel. The service in both restaurants was adequate, though nowhere near as good as the Rambagh Palace (Jaipur) or the Amarvilas(Agra). Locationwise, the Imperial is great for tourists, very central for all the sightseeing, and only 5 min. from the New Delhi railway station, therefore easy to catch the 6 am Shatabdi express (highly recommend !) to Agra &amp; the Taj Mahal.I chose my accommodations in India with a bias towards historical significance, and the Imperial did not disappoint. For the price of a highend, cookie-cutter chain hotel room in North America I got a unique, stunning hotel full of Old World charm with luxury to boot. I would happily return to this Delhi landmark. "
the imperial ,"Very high quality class act My wife and I started our visit to India with three nights at the Imperial. The name fits the place. The hotel is elegant and sophisticated, with a well-developed air of the old British era in India. We were booked in a very spacious suite, with a very large living room, bedroom large enough to hold a very comfortable king bed and some additional small pieces of furniture, a small sitting area with desk near the closet, and a pleasant and good-sized bathroom. While very comfortable, the room didn't strike us as really &quot;special.&quot; The furnishings were perfectly fine but &quot;unexciting&quot;, less interesting and attractive than we found in most of our other hotels. There were two minor drawbacks: We had only a single, relatively small window, and it looked out toward another wall of the hotel; and the plumbing was such that water going down the drain made a loud sound as it exited our room. Staff were very pleasant and attentive (true everywhere we visited). The breakfast buffet was outstanding, something we found to be characteristic of the 5-star hotels at which we stayed, and we enjoyed both the Asian and Indian restaurants. Our meal in the Spice Route (Asian) was quite good if not as outstanding as we might have expected, given its reputation. Our meal in the Indian restaurant actually wasn't that tasty, although I attribute that to the selections we made (selected actually by our guests, a colleague from New Delhi and her husband). The atmosphere in both was outstanding. The hotel is filled with drawings from the British era, many quite interesting, plus several remarkable floral arrangements, including in the lobby. Incidentally, a tip for touring in Delhi: When in Old Delhi, make sure to take a bicycle-drawn rickshaw ride through the market area. The crowds, the colors, the noise, the smells - it all combines into a seemingly well-orchestrated chaos, a truly memorable assault on all the senses. That was one of the major highlights of a great trip to India, filled with highlights. "
the imperial ,"A beautiful hotel We stayed at the Imperial for a blissful week. It is a beautiful 1930s hotel which is well run and in excellent condition. There are many delightful architectural features (e.g. internal courtyards with fountains) and the jasmin-scented corridors are decorated with delightful pictures - our corridor had tinted prints of rock-cut temples in the south of India which gave us the idea for another trip!Breakfast was excellent and a real pleasure to enjoy on the shaded terrace. We ate at all of the restaurants: the 1911 (Brasserie), San Gimigniano (Italian), Daniell's Tavern(Indian with music) and the famous Spice Route (South-East Asian). All were good, with the Italian restaurant particularly enjoyable.The staff everywhere were very pleasant and helpful.We visited a number of other 5 star hotels for drinks and meals (including the Taj) and never felt that we had stayed at the wrong place. All in all, good value for money. "
the imperial ,"Disappointing accommodation. Disgusting breakfast beverages. Disappointing room: Dark,smelly and overlooking a construction site! Yes, on arriving from London at 3am we were shown to our twin-bedded room on the 1st floor, which really stank of stale tobacco smoke. We immediately asked for a transfer to another room, which was across the corridor; this seemed smaller than the first one but it did not stink. In the morning in the light of day, we pulled back the curtains to see that or room overlooked a construction site, with huts, earth moving machinery and rubble. Of course we asked to be moved again, but were told (despite insisting several times) that there were no other rooms available. (This I do not believe). Only two nights later, just before the day we were due to leave were we told there was another room available. For the record, all the windows in The Imperial appear to be small. Perhaps it was built as a fort in the 19th century but the effect is to let in very little daylight and the bedroom was dark and dingy. All very disappointing for my wife as it was her first trip to India and I had told her about my previous 3 stays at the Imperial with its lovely old-fashioned neo colonial atmosphere and historic 19th century ambiance. Unfortunately, since my last stay in 2003, the hotel has undergone a complete refurbishment and although they have retained most of the features as they were before, somehow much ofthe old somewhat-faded atmosphere appears to have been lost. Before, The Imperial was truly unique, now it is more like any other luxury hotel and something of the former charm has been lost in the process. One final thing. If you look forward to a nice cup of coffee or tea with your breakfast, forget it! Both my wife and I agreed that the coffee and breakfast tea was the most disgusting we had tasted anywhere, ever. So bring your own instant and tea bagsif you want a half decent cuppa. David S Baber, London March 5th 2009 "
the imperial ,"Great historic hotel I stayed at the Imperial Hotel while visiting Delhi in transit to Bhutan...The hotel is very centrally located...Close to the Red Fort and Parliament...The hotel is very traditional and finished in a colonial fashion...It has all modern amenities (small gym and business center) as well as very good restaurants...The Spice Route restaurant was excellent and regarded as one of the best restauarants in India...The staff are very friendly, particularly the Sikh doormen,and the concierge was responsive to our pre-arrival requests...While in Delhi we also ate at the restaurant Bukhara, located at the ITC Sheraton, and thought that it lived up to its reputation as one of the best restaurants in Asia...Bukhara had the best Indian food we have eaten, particularly if you like grilled meats...If you are looking for a traditional hotel in Delhi, the Imperial is your choice. "
the imperial ,"Elegance and Comfort in a Great Location My husband and I, and another couple, stayed at the Imperial Hotel for 3 nights in February. The hotel exceeded our expectations in all respects. The king beds were so comfortable, the rooms were elegantly decorated, and the bathrooms were modern and spacious. One of our favorite parts of the hotel was the amazing breakfast every morning. They had everything from an omelette station to a smoothie and cereal bar, to delicious pastries and breads. One of the nights, we ate at the Spice Route in the hotel. Again, delicious food, impeccable service, and quite the decor.We all highly recommend this hotel for many reasons, and without a doubt, we would stay here again! "
the imperial ,"Beautiful Old Hotel My husband had a conference in Delhi, so I came with him for a leisurely vacation. The room was beautiful, with marble floors and a great, big double armoire instead of a closet. All the sleeping rooms, as well as lobby and hallways are floral scented from oil burners (I think to counteract the smell from air pollution). There is fresh fruit in the room as well as complementary bottled water.My first time in India, and I got sick as a dog. The room service staff was very good to me, taking my requests for specific food items not on the menu and suggesting things that would be easy on my stomach. "
the imperial ,"Beautiful hotel amazing service an oasis in the mayhem. I travel to New Delhi twice a year on business and have been lucky ebough t stay at The Imperial for most of these trips. It is always a delight to come back to. A much needed home from home and an oasis of beauty and calm after the frenetic activities of the day.The service is superb, making sure that all your comforts are met. All of the staff are incredibly helpful and polite. I have been upgraded to a Superior room a few times so if you are staying for a while it's worth asking. The Imperial is becoming more and more exclusive and I hope that it does not lose its old colonial regal charm. There is now a new very extravagant but beautiful pool and a spa is being built, it will benefit form this as at the moment the sap facilities are somewhat limited.The Imperial offers a range of restaurants the best of which is the beautiful Spice Route.If you can afford to splash out stay here and enjoy the smell of jasmine that pemeates throghout! "
the imperial ,"Exceptional ambience In the madness of Delhi, this hotel is an oasis. Fastidiously maintained, you wander in awe of the British Empire. Spice Route, the restaurant, is excellent. A memorable experience. "
the imperial ,"disappointing Grand, comfortable public areas. (Room 148) Marble on bedroom floor with dark furniture and small windows. Overlooked ancillary area meant curtains had to be drawn for privacy and loud noise early a.m. Toilet did not work properly had to get a plumber to sort.Bar very masculine, lack of relaxed seating. Not great for single traveller.Italian restaurant fab but extortionate. 1911 pleasant for meals.Breakfast very good but service poor second morning.Had a Swedish massage in salon. Specifically requested not almond oil. Guess what, not only did i have almond oil but the masseur slathered so much on me you could have fried fish and chips for a 1000 with it! Better than the Shangri La. Prefer Trident Gurgaon or Oberoi "
the imperial ,"Lovely Hotel! This hotel is lovely! The rooms are very comfortable with lovely big bathrooms. We tried 2 of the restaurants, The Spice Route and Daniell's Tavern. The food was OK in each of them but the service was exceptionally slow and forgetful. The restaurants were also freezing! The bars are lovely in the hotel and I did have one of the nicest Mango Daiquiris I had had in India. I was disappointed to discover the swimming pool was closed especially as we had had no prior notification of this. I would stay here again though but I probably wouldn't eat here. "
the imperial ,"A Great Way to Begin Our Whirlwind Tour of India! After a trek in Northern India, we returned to Delhi to begin a whirlwind sightseeing tour of 5 cities in 7 days. From our initial greeting by the doorman and throughout our stay the service was prompt and professional, our room spacious and well-appointed, and the meals we had at 1911 (I could have eaten the dhal Imperial for every meal!) and The Spice Route were the best of our trip. All our days were spent sightseeing, so we did not have a chance to explore the pool or outdoor areas of the hotel. On our way back to the U.S. through Delhi we booked a day-room at the Imperial (they stored all of our trekking gear for a week), which definitely exceeded our expectations - it was on the lower floor and although small, had all of the amenities we needed. "
the imperial ,"Jasmine scented splendor The Imperial was the final stop for our last two nights in India. It was something we were looking forward to a great deal. The reception area and flower arrangements throughout the hotel are stunning. The smell of jasmine runs through the whole hotel and creates a real sense of serenity and well being. The hotel is impeccably clean, our room was very comfortable and we enjoyed every minute of it. However. 1) One day we were there was Republic Day. We had booked our room months in advance and a courtesy note to advice us of the disruption the day would cause should have been sent - they had our email address i.e. all the shops and main attractions were shut and it's a 'dry' day. They could have used it as an opportunity to get tickets for us. 2) The swimming pool area was completely under repair and having a massive overhaul which was a big disappointment - we should have been forewarned about this and potentially an incentive to still stay at the hotel provided i.e. a drink in the bar, or a concession towards a spa treatment, for example. 3) This is not the hotel's fault, but, one evening in the Italian restaurant our meal was pretty much ruined by a bitter old American who complained about absolutely everything and was extremely rude to the staff for a prolonged period. It does give some indication of the 'types' of people who stay here i.e. those who like to get their own way and do not consider others because they are so rich. - It just left the evening a bit tainted when it was a treat for us to be there. 4) I was surprised at the room rate that breakfast wasn't included. It's pretty expensive - it's a buffet, so just eat and eat to get your money's worth!! "
the imperial ,"Fantastic Hotel - Probably the best in Delhi A fantastic hotel. Everything about it was great.The interiors of the hotel are fantastic. Everything was designed to a very elegant taste, really British Imperial Time.The rooms are very spacious, nicely decorated. All the amenities are there and are of the top quality.The service is quick and efficient. We tried what is supposedly the best restaurant in Delhi &quot;The Spice Route&quot; and we were quite disappointed by how regular the food was.That was the only down side of the hotel. Other than that, it was a fantastic stay and would definitely go there again if we are in Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Grand old lady Grand old lady with some really nice art deco touches. Feels very British imperial, although elements have been modernized. Some good restaurants and excellent service. Drawbacks - the swimming pool is right one hedge away from one of the noisiest road junctions in Delhi. Do not stay here if you are intending to relax by the pool. My room looked onto the reception, not something everyone would care for. "
the imperial ,An excellent place to decompress upon arrival into India! This is one very gracious hotel with a most accommodating staff. Rooms are lovely and calming and I was so happy I had my first three nights here before my seven-week tour of India. Breakfast buffet was plentiful but the Sunday brunch at 2100 rupees (USD $43) was a bit pricey for the uninspiring food choices. Nonetheless I'd stay at this hotel anytime again. 
the imperial ,"Disappointing Experience This was our second trip to India and the Imperial and unfortunately disappointing. Service standards have slipped, a disappointing dinner at the hotel restaurant San Gimignano, cold room service breakfast and no hot water in the morning for our shower. Given the high room rate, I would suggest trying elsewhere in Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Grande Dame with a strong lack of atmosphere The Imperial is truly a grand and mythic hotel. One of those you want to stay at least once even if everybody knows there are sme better in town.Usually, when you stay once, you cannot imagine going anywhere else afterwards for your next stays. This works with the Raffles in Singapore or the Oriental in Bangkok. But there, with the Imperial, my next stay might let me try the Oberoi or, of course, the opening Aman Delhi!The Imperial is a wonderfull building plenty of memorabilia of old India - sometimes, you do not understand how this can be possible without being shocking for Indian citizens... Public areas are a bit glitzzy but let us think this is due to recent renovation.The overall staff is friendly and respectful. And they have an excellent Thai restaurant with a top service. The bar is really enjoyable as well even if they might learn to make less sweet cocktails (my Singapore sling was more into syrup than any alcohol).The service at the airport is excellent as well and we did not have anything to do until accessing the airport lounge. That is perfect.Then come the many issues which make the Imperial a faded glory.The spa, first : NO SPA!!!!!!!!!! Even no indoor pool in a frozen city for January! Can you believe this. I cannot imagine coming there in Summer...Then, the rooms. We stayed two times at the Imperial (at our arrival in India, then 10 days later). We had very nice suites (Heritage and Art Deco) and I do thank management for the upgrades. Those suites are nice but bathrooms need a serious modernization: only one lavabo! No conditioner! As welcome gift: few fruits. These are details but we are speaking of world top hotels there...Relation with money is tricky: after checking out, I wanted to post a postcard. I was asked for the 20 rupiahs!!!! while in the room waiting for the bellmen to pick up our luggage, an employee entered the room and check three times the minibar, then call the reception to say what we took away - of course he did ask for permission to use the phone!!!Finally, security is a big joke. As a VIP guest, the security manager asked me who I am - all staff members had my picture before... At the entrance, we are asked to go through a security gate: when ringing, they do not go into deeper examination...The Imperial is a really beautiful hotel with many &quot;but&quot;. I hope its management will act to improve it. "
the imperial ,Awesome Experience at the Imperial Delhi We stayed at the Imperial in December 2009 right after Christmas. We checked in late after our international flight and the staff was as friendly as could be. They even gave a wrapped present to our children. There was a fruit basket waiting and a welcome note. The room was huge and the bathroom was gorgeous! We really enjoyed the hotel--we enjoyed room service and the Spice route--as well as dinner at the Coffee Shop--it was a very pleasant experience. we will be back! 
the imperial ,"Truly deserving of it's world class reputation We have just returned from a 10 day trip to India which involved a 2 night stay at this hotel. It is truly one of the most exceptional hotels I have ever stayed in. The drive from the airport to the centre of Delhi can be a bit of a culture shock if you're not used to India ( if you call the hotel they will have a driver pick you up from the airport..I would recommend this ! ). You arrive at the oasis of calm that is The Imperial. We were shown to our room and told that we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary : the door opened into the most amazing suite, all marble, cream sofas, fresh flowers, a corridor leading to the bedroom and beautiful bathroom. Then there was a knock on the door and they produced a bottle of champagne and a cake, with a note wishing us Happy Anniversary. There are 4 restaurants, and the 2 we ate at were both great. We had a hotel driver take us out for the afternoon to give us a quick tour. he was knowledgeable, interesting and in total it only cost about £30. Service from start to finish was 5 star and I was truly sorry to leave. Cannot recommend more highly. "
the imperial ,"Wonderful This is a sumptuous hotel which is extremely well managed. The attentive, polite and pleasant staff are in no way intrusive. They laid on a stunning welcome for us when they realised that it was our 25th Wedding Anniversary. On our two visits this year we had a heritage suite and a heritage room both of which were exceptional. The swimming pool is like something out of a Busby Berkeley movie. I had it to myself one morning!We have eaten at the 1911 Terrace restaurant and found it excellent but we found the much vaunted Spice Route restaurant a let-down. Perhaps it was just an off-night. I have to say though that the hotel management have actually written to us at home in England to apologise for our visit to the Spice Route after we mentioned our disappointment casually to our driver as he took us to the station. Now that is customer service. "
the imperial ,"Fantastic atmosphere The imperial is a fantastic hotelThe location is perfect, very close to the center of old Delhi. The palace is fantastic and the staff friedlyThe atmosphere brings you to the old times of the colonialism!We found a very good offer on the website of the hotel and would definitely suggest to stay in this hotel "
the imperial ,"Imperialist paradise The hotel's museum-like qualities are well known, and all true. I have never seen, much less stayed in, something so lavish. Unfortunately I was there for business, as otherwise it would be tempting to take refuge in one of the rooms for a week. Excellent cleanliness, food, etc. Caveat: I found the staff to be far more deferential than I was personally comfortable with. My only complaint: the business centre services were priced well beyond the realm of acceptable. "
the imperial ,"5 Star Luxury with a very friendly Atmostphere Charming hotel with a lovely atmostphere. Beautiful public areas with interesting art, splendid double room with excellent facillities. The outdoor pool was a lovely place to relax after a long flight s was the main bar. We had a most enjoyable meal in The Spice Restaurant which is ideal if you like South East Asian Cuisine. The service was good and the staff were very friendly. "
the imperial ,"A grand hotel We have just returned from a three week trip to India and this was the first hotel we stayed in. It set a very high standard for the seven other 5* hotels we then stayed in. Unlike other reviewers we found it hard to fault with old fashioned high standards. It was indeed a real oasis in the middle of polluted Delhi. The pool was awesome. If you like a warm pool, this is for you. The steam was rising when we went in in the early evening - absolutely delicious after a long flight. We found the restaurant to be excellent with superb, friendly service. The whole hotel was stylish and not at all flash or vulgar. They've been doing this for a long time and it shows. "
the imperial ,"True tourist hotel A beautiful hotel with wonderful architecture and great location is spoilt by average staffing and poor facilities.Like other reviews I suffered from poor staffing in restaurants the table wasn't cleared when I sat at it, I waited over 10 minutes for a menu, and getting the bill was an effort. Frustrating if you are having a break between meetings.Despite the plush corridors and very nice room no effort has been made on fitness facilities, and it is not clear if the temporary &quot;room&quot; is permament. The weight area now has a dent in the ceiling from me lifting a handweight above my head (I'm only 173cm!). And when I was staying the beautiful gardens that I remember from previous visits to the restaurants were covered with temporary structures for a function. A loud function which took place metres from my ground floor room.Overall it is hard to justify the cost ($400 a night) trading on heritage and location might work for tourists but for anything beyond an experience it is disappointing. "
the imperial ,"Bizarre We had a somewhat odd experience here. We had booked online and the room discription was of a room with a garden view and either a kingsize bed or twins . In the event the room we were put into had no view and an ordinary sized bed. We complained to the deputy manger at which point things took a turn to the surreal. We showed him our booking form clearing outlining view, bed size, etc. At which point he began to argue vehemently that this was not an issue of misinformation but of style.... &quot; But &quot; we protested, &quot; it clearly says here that we bought a room with a kingsize bed and a garden view &quot; &quot; What is the problem ?&quot; he said. &quot; the bed or the view &quot; ? &quot; Both &quot; we replied , but he didnt seem to get it at all. He continued to witter on about themes and styles. Eventually he moved us to another room which..had a kingsize bed and a view of the garden. I thanked him and told him that we do not usually make a habit of complaining. &quot; You are not complaining now &quot; he said firmly.&quot; Well actually I am &quot; I said. &quot; No you are not &quot; , he replied. I gave up at this point and decided to do something formal about it on our return.All this was a pity because the second room was very pleasant, we had an excellent meal, good service , and slept like logs.The business with the deputy manager left an unpleasant taste though. "
the imperial ,"More Fur Coat than Knickers A great Delhi location, a pretty good 1930's builiding, and loads of money spent on jazzing it up is still spoilt by energetic but forgetful and unskilled service. In India, charm and a real (not unforced) concern for guest's welfare comes free. To mess it up by not ensuring that the (admittedly characterful) staff remember to bring tea, clear dirty plates, take orders, bring correct orders, bring bills, all of which they failed to do repeatedly, is a careless waste of good raw service material and a fine building. When we spoke to the Terrace Manager (the main offending facility, though the curiously named Daniell's Tavern was prone to it too) his comment was that he would discipline the staff. Our comment was that he should give people with a real aptitude for the work some proper training.Ho hum.If you want to see how well trained staff add to an experience, stay at the Oberoi in Delhi; much better value, frankly. If you like glitz, the Imperial's for you. If you like real quality, less conveniently located though, try the Oberoi. "
the imperial ,"The Only Place to Stay in Delhi! This is my third visit to the Imperial and they've done it again - a hidden oasis in the hustle abd bustle of Janpath. Overall a great stay but There were a few minor things which disappointed.Front desk and check in: Me and my mom arrived at the hotel (from the airport) at 11.50. Check in is at 12 noon. The lady at the front desk said our room wasn't ready and we should wait in lobby - seemed reasonable. At 12.15 the room was still not ready and I questioned the lady at the desk. She apologised and suggested we have a coffee at their restaurant or something - I asked whether this 'coffee' was complimentary as it was the hotel causing the delay. She refused point blank which I thought was very unreasonable for a hotel of this standard. This might sound miser on my part however hotels like the Taj Mahal on Man Singh Rd and the Oberoi have been much more accomadating in situations like this.Room: We stayed in an Imperial room (no. 56) which was at the end of the corridor on the ground floor. Good sized room, however for more space I would recommend a heritage room (which is what I booked on my last visit). Out of the three telephones, one didn't work - I couldn't be bothered to complain though.Breakfast: buffet b/f in the 1911 restaurant serves a wide variety of indian and continental foods, fresh fruits and juices, bakery products etc..... All were very good and its a great way to start the day.Location: couldn't be better - at the top of Janpath - were all the touristy things are and also centrally located to everything of interest in delhi: IGI airport is a 30 min drive away (Rs 500 by local taxi), India gate and Cannought Place are also very close by car.VERDICT: the property and the aura of the place, the location and the overall experience of the hotel is worth the price tag attached to this place. A must see (stay!) hotel. "
the imperial ,"Wonderful Imperial Expensive but well worth the money. We booked a suite for a family of 4 (14 &amp; 6) and even though our youngest should have stayed in our king size bed,since she stayed free, I found a blanket and asked for an extra sheet which meant she slept on the sofa. Our son was an extra £70.00 a night with a Z bed in the lounge.Pool superb and the travel desk orgnaised a 8 hour city tour which, including driver and guide, cost around £80.00 for the 4 of us in a large A/c car. Food amazing, as one would expect, of a 5* and service impeccable.Only down side was the suite has internal view which, although reduced traffic noise levels, meant no natural daylight.I had a pedicure at the Spa which was extremely good value when compared to UK prices.A true art deco hotel full of historic paintings and pictures. "
the imperial ,Exceptional ambience We stayed at the Imperial for 3 nights. A heaven in the middle of all the bustle in the streets.The room was very comfortable. Very polite and helpful staff. Several very good restaurants in the hotel. I like very much the bar. Quick an effective service. We spent 2 afternoons by the pool which was great.An overall very good stay 
the imperial ,"Absolutely Beautiful All round just the most spectacular hotel. Drive up a long palm fringed drive to the bell-men wearing the most elaborate uniforms, then enter the most sublime jasmine infused, flower laden marble foyer. An all round sensory experience!Impeccable service, stunning rooms, quite formal and austere but quintessentially respectful service. You really feel like you've been transported to another place and time, and are treated like royalty!It is such a heavenly oasis of calm &amp; serenity in the hot hustle-bustle of Delhi.I've been lucky to stay in some pretty spectacular hotels over the years, and this is definately up there.A level of service that you can only seem to get in Asia. "
the imperial ,"Lovely Hotel Service Problems Stayed at Imperial for one week on a business trip. Stayed in 2 separate rooms due to taking a side trip to Agra. First room was lovely, bright &amp; airy, situated close to front of hotel. Second room was very small, very noisy and had no natural light. Service in the hotel restaurant was good. Service in the bar was pretty poor, the staff seem to have an attitude problem and are very aggressive in their approach. What ruined the stay for me was the front desk staff. I had to cut my stay short by one day to return home &amp; despite having given them 7 days notice they point blank refused to not charge me the extra night. I have never encountered this before. Not only did they insist on charging me, but they were rude, aggressive and spent 30 mins arguing with me about the issue. I would not stay in this hotel the next time I visit Delhi, I would go for the Shangri-La instead, where the service is impeccable. "
the imperial ,"Nice to see but beware staying . . . We had a very mediocre stay at the Imperial. The building is undoubtedly gorgeous, and is definitely worth a thorough walk-through. However, I would not recommend staying here. As mentioned in previous reviews, the service was lackluster - polite, but very stiff. Our room was also very claustrophobic - only small windows that look out onto an interior courtyard (with echoing noise from the ground level). And BEWARE THE TAXES! The room rate was 11750 rupees, but they assessed a 12.5% tax based on an arbitrary, undisclosed &quot;rack&quot; rate of 29000+ rupees. That amounted to a tax in excess of 30% of our room charge. Outrageous. "
the imperial ,Elegant luxury We stayed for 2 nights and 3 nights at the beginning and end of our Golden Triangle trip.When we arrived we were greatly impressed at how beautiful the hotel was. It was an oasis of calm in a very hectic and hot city.It is a fine Art Deco building and has a lovely colonial feel inside with magnificient paintings and floral displays.The room was spacious and very well appointed and quiet. It has all the ameanities you could ever need. We were unaware of any building work going on in the hotel.The hotel makes you feel very special as if you are the most important guest.It is nice to get the water and cold towels and fruit kebabs by the pool.On our second visit we were welcomed back as if we were regular guests and upgraded to a suite.We agree with other reviews that food and drink are expensive but what else would you expect of a 5 star hotel.All in all this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in and would recommend to anyone. 
the imperial ,"IMO not #2! I had always wanted to stay here. The Imperial is a beautiful hotel but seems to have some serious problems. Most serious is noise. The rooms are not particularly quiet, especially in the older section of the hotel. During my stay, I had to change rooms 3 times. Desk clerks seemed pleasant but clueless about construction going on below my room which lasted until 11 p.m.The business center could be better run as a loud talkitive guest disrupted my computer time until I said something to him. The female staff is simply too timid to ask anyone to keep the level of noise down so that others can work. I'd warn any guest to check their bill carefully as mine was full of erroneous minibar charges. It took a long time to get them removed. Judging from experiences on other trips to Delhi, I would have to say that I prefer the Oberoi or Taj Mahal hotels. "
the imperial ,"Beautiful and comfortable hotel with some drawbacks This hotel is well worth a visit for its architectural beauty and for the hundreds of paintings it houses. Its large swimming pool is just as impressive and the pool-side service is top quality. Overall, the staff are friendly and helpful in this hotel and they work hard to keep it immaculate and clean. The rooms and public areas have fantastic marble floors and the rooms are very comfortable. Our room was allocated on arrival and was of a relatively high standard, including a dressing room.We had room service once, which was a delicious breakfast that was promptly brought to our room. The coffee was particularly good. We found that one breakfast was enough for two people to share. The food in the rest of the hotel was a bit of a let down but perhaps more because we were attempting to eat on a budget - all of the restaurants here are fairly pricey. The Indian food was definitely better value than western meals. Cocktails cost the equivalent of £10 so there is no avoiding Western prices. A useful tip for water: complimentary water is provided in the room twice a day as well as by the pool. It was helpful to know we could stock up at the pool if we had run out. The most unfortunate aspect of our stay was that we ended up moving rooms twice. On our first night there was incredibly loud music coming from a building across the road (although it was loud even in our room). The hotel assured us it would stop after 1030 which it did not. After a few phone calls downstairs they offered to let us sleep in another room (it was 1230 by this time and too late to move all our stuff) and then we returned to our original room the next morning. They then moved us to another room for our last night (we were only there two nights). So I have seen quite a few of the hotel's rooms and they are all excellent but this incident was unfortunate. The staff did do their best to help us though. While it was not the hotel's fault we found (here and during the rest of our trip in Delhi) that wedding season was having a negative impact on our holiday, mainly in terms of noise. A spa is currently being built at the Imperial and we had to listen to the construction noise from our first room. This is a necessary inconvenience though for the hotel to improve its services, but beware. Overall, this hotel is worth a visit for its aesthetic appeal and good service. "
the imperial ,"Try it at least once This is my third visit to this hotel and this place never ceases to amaze me... The facilities and services are of very high class (well! pure luxury if you ask me...) The whole place has a colonial feel and will definitely take you back in time... The rooms and beds are spacious and have all the modern amenities you could ask for -including a pillow menu!!! The hotel is also located in one of the best parts of the Delhi (Janpath) and is close to many restaurants and the shopping district.. If you are frequent traveler to Delhi and never stayed in this hotel, I would seriously urge you to try it at least once – Trust me! You won’t regret it.. "
the imperial ,"My favorite place in Delhi After two... less successful... Delhi stays, I decided not to fool around and just book the nicest hotel in Delhi for my third stay, which numerous sources claimed was The Imperial. It was cheaper than I thought it would be, perhaps 3-4 times what a typical budget room in Delhi would cost, and while this is still fairly expensive, you can certainly see where the money goes. Common areas and my room were impeccably clean, well-appointed, and very classy. There must be thousands of unique paintings all over the hotel and in the rooms, and I spent an enjoyable couple of hours simply walking around the inside of the hotel. The room was very comfortable, better by a good margin than what I typically get in the US staying at 3-4 star hotels, with a reading chair, a top-notch bed, and separate tub and shower. The furniture/fixtures are among the nicest I've ever seen in a hotel. I ate at two restaurants, The Spice Route and 1911, both were quite good, in fact The Spice Route I would call outstanding, and only cost us about $35/person with dessert. I ordered a cocktail from room service, which was promptly delivered and delicious, if overpriced. The service was excellent, the best I had in India. They let me check in 3 hours early with no additional cost, responded immediately to all of my queries, and, most importantly, seemed in tune with what westerners expect from an expensive hotel, getting the right mix of attentiveness and respect and avoiding the obsequiousness I experienced almost everywhere else. They treated me as a guest, and not a cash machine, which I really appreciate.My complaints: given what you get, the room and the restaurants aren't really that expensive by western standards, but the pricing for 'extras' is almost insulting... a minibar Coke would cost $5, a beer $10, etc, and worst of all, they wanted Rs700 to drive me literally down the street (~1KM) to my next hotel... I got a taxi on the street for Rs75, and I'm sure even that was gouging me. The car pricing in particular left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Still, they were certainly upfront with their pricing, and I was happy to pay for the room and food. I stayed at one other 5-star hotel in Delhi, which was perhaps $75 cheaper for the room and food, but was not nearly as nice, so if you're going to 'splurge' to escape Delhi, I recommend going all out and staying at The Imperial. "
the imperial ,"Smiles of honesty or pure greed? The location of the Imperial is excellent if your interest lies in exploring Delhi which was one of my main reasons for staying here.As I like hotels that stand out from the norm, the Imperial did not disappoint as it is like walking inside a museum. Everything is spotless and the staff does their utmost to keep the place in shape.With the exception of eating at 1910, which was so so, I only had the breakfast buffet in the hotel. Compared to other hotels I have staid at in India the breakfast was great, however in comparison with breakfasts in standard hotels in many European countries such as Sweden, it was nothing special. As someone who eats sandwiches for breakfast, the choice was not too good eg. regarding different kinds of cheese.When it comes to the service, everyone is indeed smiling and very kind: in some extent, at least for me, though it is rather difficult to be addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; all the time especially as I hardly feel like one.Some issues regarding service:In the 1910 bar, I ordered &quot;a pint&quot; of beer which turns out to be a small bottle of 0,33 liter. My question whether &quot;a pint&quot; is not a measurement of volume was brushed aside as the staff claimed that an Indian pint is indeed a small bottle of 0,33 liter. Later on on my bill, however, the cost of a bottle of beer and a pint differed even though I have had the same sort of beer. As the costs seemed to differ on all my visits, I could not make out what I really should have ordered for getting what I call a pint.However, what irritated me most (I staid at Imperial on two different occassions) was the dishonesty upon check-out regarding what currency my creditcard was to be debited. I was very clear with that I wanted my bill settled in Indian Rupees, as any other transaction currency would lead to higher costs for me. The staff claimed that it was purely a service to present the bill in USD and that the transaction would in reality be in Rupees. Later on, obviously, I checked my bank account and the staff's claim of a simple service turned out to be a lie, as the transaction was conducted in USD. Upon my second stay, I was told the same thing in the Imperial shop. Consequently, it appears as if the staff either is unaware of the disservice they are doing as I find it hard to believe it is intentional. Upon a stay of a couple of days, the difference in transaction currencies can turn out to be worth 1000-2000 Rupees or equivalent in your own currency. I find this annoying and unworthy behaviour of a five star hotel.Overall, the Imperial is definetely worth a stay, though my visits there made me wonder whether there was greed rather than honesty behind some of the staffs' smile. "
the imperial ,"Outstanding service The hotel was lovely. What I was so impressed with was the service. My plane arrived late (2 am) and my prearranged airport transfer (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN) was there and waiting. My luggage was lost. My plans ,unfortunately, were to leave on the 6am train to Agra and spend one night there and return back to the Imperial for business meetings the next 3 days. When I returned to the hotel, the man that picked me up at 2am, had returned to the airport and secured my luggage and the hotel had sent my luggage to the room and stored all my clothes in the closet. Outstanding! "
the imperial ,"Calm oasis in Delhi We stayed here at the beginning of a lengthy Indian vacation tour. The hotel offers the comfortable luxury rooms and good service at a price to be expected for a busy capital. We received excellent food and service during our stay. The service was not as personalised as some of the other (comparable larger) hotels during our stay, but always good and efficient.The rooms are well appointed, (and with all modern conveniences working- I note this because a couple of other luxury properties had 'glitches' with the A/C, fans, doors etc ). The breakfast experience was a really wonderful preparation before a hot day in the city. The whole hotel is a bit of a museum- but that is part of the attraction for many guests. Business visitors will still be at home here- it was obvious that there were many guests international and domestic alike there on business.In short, I would certainly return to the Imperial as a tourist or on business. "
the imperial ,"In the middle of delhi Very nice hotel we stayed here in the begining of our tour in india and at the end (spent 3 nights in total) the hotel is fantastic marble floors wonderful jasmine scent our rooms had very comfortable beds the reception staff weren't too friendly but we didn't have to deal with them so much, so no big deal.The restaurants in this hotel are fantastic we had dinner at the famous spice restaurant (thai) DELICIOUS!!! also at the tuscany and the french food here was absolutely delightful.They could improve the pool appeareance as it was the only thing of the hotel that didnt have good maintenance..great location in the middle of the city... good hotel to stay!!! "
the imperial ,"Superb This is a great hotel. It has a large very well trained and friendly staff all of whom are at all times impeccably dressed. It is an older hotel but maintenance and renovation have kept it up to date and on par with anything new.The restaurants are all very good too. I was here a week on business and I ate at them all. Even if you are staying somewhere else go to the Southeast Asian restaurant for delicious food and stunning decor.All of this is the reason that this hotel may be priced higher than some others but you do get a lot more and in the off season it is a huge bargain.Delhi can be a tough city with the heat, pollution, beggars and unrelenting rickshaw drivers -- this was my sanctuary. I can find nothing to be critical about! "
the imperial ,"A bit 'over-the-top' The huge Sikh doorman with an impressive moustache, cream uniform and red turban made an instant impression on us travel-stained tourists, as did the smiling ladies in their identical red uniform-saris who welcomed us as we walked into the lobby. Our senses were assaulted by the abundance of glass, chrome, gilt, lights, multi-coloured marble, deep red roses, white carnations, portraits, landscapes and perfume that is regularly sprayed into the air from discreet white containers as we were guided to our Heritage room, no. 254, from which we had a glimpse of the swimming pool and gardens. The bathroom was huge, with gorgeous Fragonard toiletries. It was pleasant to have a dressing room but disappointing to have been given twin beds. We sleep together at home – why should we want to sleep apart when on holiday; especially one on which we were celebrating our Silver Wedding? We hadn’t been offered a choice and were too tired to try to change rooms. That evening, after a mind-blowing afternoon organised by our tour company, the excellent Audley Travel, we ate in the hotel’s Spice Trade restaurant. It was delightful to sit in the restaurant’s intimate, subtly-lit courtyard, beside the rectangular candle-lit central pool, and dine under the stars, though the Thai food didn’t quite live up to its reputation. The next morning we had a lonely breakfast on the terrace at 5.30am, enjoying a wide selection of prepared fruit, fresh watermelon juice and perfectly cooked scrambled egg &amp; toast. A few days later we returned for another night, and ate in the hotel’s Italian Restaurant, since I was ‘all curried-out’ by then. The food made a pleasant change, but was very ordinary and over-priced. This Heritage Room, no. 57 on the ground floor, was smaller than the previous one but the breakfast we’d ordered in our room for 4.30am arrived right on time and was every bit as good as before. Apart from our welcome, I couldn’t describe the staff as ‘friendly’ but perhaps we didn’t stay long enough to give them a chance. The whole experience was rather ‘over the top’ but very memorable, and was a good introduction to the many contrasts we would meet in India. "
the imperial ,"Haven From The Heat As my husband and I have been regular visitors to Delhi in the last few years we have had the opportunity to visit the Imperial for meals and drinks on a few occasions and so on our latest trip we decided to stay here for three nights. Like all luxury hotels in Delhi it is very expensive - our special internet rate plus taxes came in at around $AUS 650 a night for a basic room and breakfast. First time travellers to India should be aware that taxes on luxury rooms, food and alcohol can add up to $100 a day to the final bill.The Imperial really is like a piece of an India gone by - a remnant of the colonial past but one that is beautifully restored and maintained. The main areas of the hotel are glorious and it is lovely to wander the hallways and look at the artworks and photographs. Our room was spacious and very comfortable (bed was the most comfortable I have found in India!) but a little cold - we had to turn the aircon off even though it was 38 degrees outside. We had a room which faced an internal lightwell and so it was generally quiet and no traffic noise just the tinkling of a fountain. On the second night we were awoken at 3am by some noise - probably from the ballroom below us -- but when I told staff the next day they were very keen to resolve this and offerred to move us to another room.We found the food in the 1911 restaurant to be so so and I agree with other reviewers that the service is a bit below par. I say this as a comparison to the Oberoi in New Delhi where the food and service in the main restaurant are second to none. Another observation I would make is that the staff at the Imperial look uncomfortable and outdated in their liveried uniforms - although I understand they are trying to maintain the period look I think they would be better in more modern, streamlined uniforms without the turbans, etc. We did dine in the Spice Route and really enjoyed our meal. The menu is Thai influenced but with an Indian twist and we recommend the Kerala Lamb curry - delicious. The 1911 restaurant has an interesting dress code and men must wear long pants to dine in the Brasserie or restaurant even when it is 40 degrees. My husband was dressed in smart dress shorts and designer shirt and was asked to sit in the bar area rather than the restaurant because of this and yet the very next day a large group of visitors to the hotel wearing what I would class a very casual, hippy attire were seated in the Brasserie next to us with no problem and then proceeded to smoke - no staff member was game to ask them to leave. A bit annoying!We found the pool area and service to be good and as it was hot we took the opportunity to have a swim. The general location of the Imperial is great for shopping at the Emporiums and the markets on Janpath where there are good bargins to be found but be warned when you venture outside the gates you are an easy target to taxi drivers, rickshaw drivers and hawkers in general who will tell you all manner of things to convince you to go with them. This can be a little confronting if you have never been to Delhi before but just stick to your guns and walk on by. If you want a local taxi, ask the doorman at the hotel to call one in and he will tell them what you want and will give you a rough idea of the price. You can hire taxis by the hour or by the meter. If you want big, modern malls these now exist in Delhi ie Select City Walk in South Delhi or visit the more traditional shopping areas like Khan Market and South Extension for really good books, clothes, etc.We enjoyed the experience of staying at the Imperial and would recommend it to friends but if we had to choose we would opt for the Oberoi for the standard of service, the facilities (pools, gym) and the food and location which we would consider to be superior for the same price. Visit the Imperial for afternoon tea or to dine at Spice Route or to look at the artwork but stay at the Oberoi for more slick service. "
the imperial ,"A colonial museum We stayed at The Imperial as part of a personal guided tour of Rajesthan. There is nothing to fault it. The rooms are beautiful, the staff are attentive and the food in all the restaurants is very good. Walking around the corridors is like being in a museum, shiny marble floors and hundreds of pictures showing scenes of old India. Worth a visit even if you're not staying. "
the imperial ,"An oasis of comfort Stayed for 3 nights on business and the hotel was one of the most comfortable places that I have ever stayed. The staff was attentive and accommodating. They arranged a day trip in a hotel car to the Taj Mahal and took excellent care of us. When I told the concierge that I needed a camera, he immediately sent someone out to get two disposable cameras for us.The grounds are beatiful and I would best describe the Imperial as an island of comfort in the general craziness that is Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Mixed feelings Architecturally this is a stunning hotel, with a fabulous art collection. The location was perfect for us as it is one of the few luxury hotels within walking distance of Connaught Place. However our room, alhough beautifully decorated and immaculately clean with a fabulously comfortable bed and a great bathroom, was a bit on the small side compared to other rooms on the same corridor. I presume this is because we booked a &quot;special rate&quot; (which by the time taxes etc were added on, came to around £260 per night anyway). Whilst the breakfast was fabulous I wouldnt bother eating in the hotel restaurants. We tried the 1910 bistro - the food was so-so, the service was shoddy and it was overpriced, albeit in a very nice setting. We also ate in the Spice Route restaurant which is supposedly one of the best restaurants in Asia, although I fail to see how. I had to send my duck back as it was overcooked. It was also the blandest food I ate on my two week trip in India.The hotel marketing plays on the fact that it is the only garden hotel in Delhi but I didnt find the garden to be anything special. If you spend anytime poolside (the pool is fine but not of the standard I would have expected of a luxury hotel) expect great service from the pool staff if you are a lone female as I was on one occasion. However the next, accompanied by Mr BB we were completely ignored. This brings me on to my major criticism of the hotel - we just did not find the service up to scratch. "
the imperial ,"Heavenly Respite This lovely hotel is wonderfully situated near all the great government emporiums and cottage industry shopping centers. So if you want to buy handicrafts and shop for the best prices, this hotel location is it. The Imperial has all the touches that make you feel welcome from the candles in the hallways to stunning floral arrangements to rooms with all the amenities. I would return there in a heartbeat. Had a variety of treatments in the beauty salon whose prices were most reasonable. I recommend their pedicures and any kind of massage or facial with Andrea who has been there for 14 years. The hotel's breakfast buffet is top notch. Dinner is a must at The Spice Route. The artwork in the hallways is unrivaled. "
the imperial ,"Business Beautiful, clean and comfortable hotel. Stayed there for business, but were helpful in arranging site-seeing, etc. "
the imperial ,"Still nice but has lost some of its luster..... Based on our experience last year at the Imperial we decided to stay here on our second trip to India. I will have to say the experience lost a bit of its luster from last year. The hotel is still beautiful, but the service seemed to have slipped a bit. I was also expecting the same level or nicer of room since it was our second stay, but the room was smaller and a bit worn. The service in the restaurants was very slow, especially at breakfast. (if you want to sit outside for breakfast be sure to arrive early) At one point I walked over to the waiters station to pour my own tea after waiting 20 minutes for a refill. We had the same level of service at dinner in the Spice Route. Don’t get me wrong this is still a great hotel, but next year if we return we will try another alternative. "
the imperial ,"Excellent all round city hotel We stayed here partly on business, partly vacation. The two rooms that we had were excellent and the service was perfect. It is a great haven in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Delhi. The hotel has more character than the Oberoi. My only gripe was that the pool area was very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Otherwise, there is not too much to criticise. "
the imperial ,"Great start to our holiday!! Imperial Chic. The Imperial is one of the most impressive hotels we ever stayed in, well worth its price. We stayed at the beginning and at the end of our journey and it was a real treat every time. The Heritage rooms we stayed in were very big, with look over the gardens or the front and quiet, comfortable, very clean and airy. The Hotel's interior is clean, modern and yet classic to preserve the charm of its history. Despite the size of the Imerial we found that the staff is exceptionally helpful at all times, a well organised management keeps everything running without the guests noticing. We had dinner at the Spice Route and Daniells and both are very good restaurants. The Spice Route is well known beyond Delhi and often busy, reservations are recommended- if you have the choice, the area outside is wonderful, underneath the sky. Back in Delhi we will make sure to return! "
the imperial ,top in the world Everything is top of the line by all western standards exept the restaurant 1911 where food is average at most and service laycy. The Italian restaurant is one of the best in the whole world. 
the imperial ,"Amazing India amazing Imperial Arriving in Delhi and after a whole day excursion, it is a real pleasure to step into the Imperial. Excellent in every respect, from service to quality of the furnishings and decor. We stayed in a Heritage room for two nights. The rooms are very luxury with atmosphere and style, although the bathroom has nothing extraordinary. Some good restaurants (Spice Route is really charming and good, but a little expensive). A real luxury and a real “garden” Hotel in the heart of this fast moving city. We would definitely recommend the Imperial. "
the imperial ,"One of the world's great hotels One of the world's great hotels . Although it is quite expensive, I felt it was worth every penny. The rooms and common areas of this hotel are amazing, exuding both elegance and character . Considering the offerings the breakfast buffet was very reasonable. I would go back in a heartbeat "
the imperial ,"Prices go up quality of service plummets I went in prepared to be happy (my Sept 2006 review serves as evidence). I will not be going back. With a jaw-dropping average room rate above $800 per night, service should be impeccable. Instead, it was shabby all around. I checked in to my full-price room at 3AM to be greeted with a twin bed and frigid air. After five hours with the heater on full, the room was still cold. A complaint elicited an offer of a heater to be delivered; it never came. Numerous small failings added up to an almost wholly negative experience. Waiting for a breakfast table and being ignored by two hostesses standing a few feet away? Asking for coffee three times before receiving it -- on two different days? Getting the bait-and-switch at the bar by ordering well gin and then being billed for the good stuff because they &quot;ran out&quot; of the other? At a 4-star stop this kind of laxity might be bearable, but at &quot;one of Asia's finest hotels&quot; it's flatly unacceptable. To top it off, my credit card was mysteriously billed many thousands of rupees in additional -- and completely illegitimate -- charges. This after I'd had several illicit charges removed at check out. I had similar problems last stay, so read your bill carefully! Two weeks later, the cashier has yet to even respond to my inquiry about the added charges. There are other top-notch hotels in New Delhi that will provide excellent service while not breaking your bank. I strongly urge you to consider looking elsewhere. "
the imperial ,"Shabby treatment over and over I stayed here several times since it was redone very nicely. In the beginning they were very courteous. Then, little by little, , the service declined. Last year, I had booked through American Express Platinum. They gave me a room with no shower, then a room with no windows (covered by some sign). Also, twice I had to change a reservation and because of the time change with the United States, they would not give a refund because I was one hour late!! Very rude and inflexible. I will never stay there again. I am going back to the Oberoi where they know how to treat repeat guests. "
the imperial ,"Reservations not honored We had booked and paid for 4 rooms at the Imperial Hotel in November 2007. The reservations were made months in advance. As we were travelling back from Agra on the train our guide learned that they would not be honoring the reservation as they had a government delegation that overstayed. We were sent to the TAj Mahal Hotel instead - excellent hotel, but not in the area we wanted to be - and definitely not the same price. After much screaming I did get them to give the 7 of us a dinner and a car to transport us one evening, but the requested refund of the room rate - or at least the diifference in the rates for the two hotels has not been forthcoming. "
the imperial ,"Wonderful hotel one of the best in the world Eight of us stayed at the Imperial for two nights as a treat (an expensive one but well worth it). Excellent in every respect, from the unobtrusive and friendly service to the outstanding quality of the furnishings and decor. A real luxury. The price is high but you get what you pay for. "
the imperial ,Not that great any longer A great property where I had last stayed in 2003. Unfortunately the service quality is mixed. There were real highlights but also a few disappointments in particulat to the &quot;1911&quot; restaurants. The &quot;San Giminignano&quot; (Italian restaurant) was excellent. Nothing really dramatic but I would be tempted to try something different next time. 
the imperial ,Amazing time at the Imperial We had an amazing time at the Imperial. We stayed twice and both times had really nice rooms. The lobbies around the hotel are very nice and the restaurants are excellents. The hotel will also arrange for a car and driver for the day. The new pool looks incredible. We would definitely recommend the Imperial. 
the imperial ,"Great place to stay Luxury rooms with atmosphere and style, good restaurants (although the Spice Route is overrated and overpriced) and delicious breakfast buffet. Small but good gym. Ideal place to stay in Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Magnificent Officers' Mess hotel Stayed in this hotel for four nights following flight from GB. Our luggage did not arrive with us because of delays in connecting UK flights. When it did ,my wife's case was soaking as was the contents. The hotel staff took away her wet clothes and these were dried, pressed and folded and returned within two hours (at no charge to us) This hotel is a reminder of what a Raj Officers' Mess was about - excellent service, food and above all the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. Prints in the hotel reinforce the image of a Mess. Without doubt this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in during world wide travels. In my opinion if you wish to experience old fashioned service in India this is the hotel in which to stay. Of lesser interest to me than my wife is the proximity to the Governemnt and othe bazaars. Don't be put off by the number of touts outside the hotel- they are not aggressive and provide an introduction to the rest of the country. "
the imperial ,"5 Star Needs Tinkering..... A grand boutique style hotel with proximity to attractions and less more touristy shopping in Delhi. The rooms are spectacular as are the restaurants in the hotel. Couple of reservations however:1) The hotel fumigates the exterior of the hotel daily, including around the restaurant while patrons are dining (imagine large scale fumigation for mosquitos rising while you are having a drink or snack). When asked the hotel wasn't aware this could be a problem for some patrons.2) During the winter months the hotel's much heralded grounds (billed as an &quot;oasis&quot; in Delhi) are untended and essentially shut down. The Imperial is the only 5 star hotel in Delhi that closes its pool and exterior seating areas in the winter (we went to the Mauriya Sheraton and Taj Palace for lunches and found both pool areas open). Some days in december were warm enough for swimming - however more importantly being able to sit outside would have been nice. 3) The hotel puts natural scent oil diffusers throughout the hotel - including outside the rooms. During our stay the oil diffused was jasmine - while pleasant in small doses, this smell over the fumes and dust of Delhi was a drag (and would be impossible for anyone with allergies or other respiratory issues).4) The hotel shop has a superb bookstore but no other commercial/shopping services available (with the exception of a chanel store....empty and or closed throughout our stay). The location of this hotel is somewhat overrated as it is likely as a tourist you will most often have a driver/taxi to take you to shopping or sites - the shops on Janpath are not the best buys or quality for shopping and feast on tourists.I would opt on a next trip for the Mauriya Sheraton - it, its shops and restaurants are fabulous and it is not particularly farther afield from shopping and attractions. "
the imperial ,"Peaceful Oasis This was my first trip to India/Delhi and I'm very happy that I stayed at the Imperial. This hotel is an old favorite of a work colleague who visits India regularly and it certainly did not disappoint. I was a bit overwhelmed by the hustle and bustel of India as well as the VERY new sights, smells, and sounds.... not to mention the local approach to driving. It was great to spend a day out in the new environment and be able to retreat back to the grand, yet very comfortable, Imperial. You honestly feel like you have stepped back in time when arriving at the hotel and greeted by the friendly staff. The hotel is a museum in itself. Be sure to spend some time looking at the art and photographs on the walls. My room was amazing with marble floors, tall ceilings, and a comfy bed. They scent the halls and rooms, which I appreciated, but understand might be off-putting to those with a sensitivity to smell. I was shocked by the cost, but understand that high hotel prices are standard for hotels in New Delhi. The contrast in general between the Imperial (opulent) and the surrounding area (local shops, etc) was staggering. The Imperial is truly an oasis with a gated 3 acre compound of sorts.My only complaint was a mix up on booking, which I didn't realize until checking out. The Imperial had me reserved for an extra night that I ultimately had to pay for due to the 24 hour cancellation policy. Learned a hard lesson that verifying your reservation at check in is critical. An expensive mistake!! "
the imperial ,"As you would expect from reviews.... This hotel does pretty much what you might expect after reading all of the reviews. If you are starting a holiday (as we were) it has a slight business feel that personally I prefer to avoid as it takes me back to the office however once through that it fitted the bill nicely as a starting point on our trip. We felt cosseted, safe, comfortable and were able to settle into India easily. We had a Heritage Room which was OK but not spectacular – only one armchair and another less comfortable chair (by the desk) so if returning would probably go for a Junior Suite.We ate in 1911 – the casual bit not the posh bit – our first night and had a burger which was very, very average and probably a mistake but we were tired and just looking for basic sustenance. We could see the Brasserie through the glass panels. It was very formal and for us the food looked good but huge portions so a bit daunting. So on our second night we went to the signature restaurant - Spice Route. Had a super meal – admittedly Sri Lankan and Vietnamese rather than northern India – but could not agree less with reviewer who compared it to a curry house. Really subtle delicate food – lovely. The bar areas are lovely and the service excellent.There was a huge tent up in the gardens – presumably for a function - so it was hard to judge the outside space. The pool was very ordinary but it is December so quite cool so no real requirement. Final comment in that Delhi is noisy. The hotel is on a main road so until quite late the car horns kept us awake. It is also wedding season so perhaps this was exaccerbated. Would recommend the Imperial but if I go back I would try the Oberoi as it looked to be in a quieter location. "
the imperial ,"Fantastic Imperial I spent two nights at the Imperial in August as part of a trip to the Taj Mahal. It was absolutely amazing!!! I wish I stayed for longer. It was luxurios but homely at the same time.The hotel had a wonderful calm atmosphere with gorgeous flower smell everywhere.Can`t compliment enough the staff working there. The room was very elegant and comfortable, the bathroom was stocked with lovely toiletries. The restaurants in the hotel were very good. I found the hotel taxis overpriced but as soon as you walk out of the room there are plenty of taxis.The swimming pool was fab, it was great to have a swim in the evening after a day out in the heat. Maybe one negative. I booked through Expedia and when I checked out the hotel charged extra tax that I didn`t expect to pay. Despite this I still think the hotel was good value and I would go back there. "
the imperial ,"Not what it could be As is the case with many world class hotels the public parts of the hotel really are the best bits. I opted for the cheapest room and whilst the bed was comfortable the room and bathroom really needed renovation if this place is keen to compete with the best.The bar is great as was the food served at the French restaurant. The swimming pool is nice although it is somewhat spoilt by the main road that runs along side it!I probably wouldn’t stay again, especially at the rates they are charging however I do not regret having stayed there once. "
the imperial ,"A great disappointment I have visited the Imperial some 5 times in the past 10 years and it has always been one of my favourite hotels in the world.However this visit, 23 to 25 Nov, was an enormous disappointment and I subscribe to the increasingly widely held view that the Imperial is now bad value for money and the staff have become very arrogant.For a five star hotel, it does not offer as good amenities as it's competitors. All 5 star hotels we visited this trip offered large complimentary bottles of water in the bedrooms and complimentary breakfast, not so Imperial. We had a superior double room, rate RPS 22,000 (c $550) and whilst the room was correct it was not particularly luxurious. Little things were not thought through, for example electricity plugs are right against the floor and so the guest has to scrabble on hands and knees to plug in an adaptor whereas all other hotels we visited had some at desk level and were thus easily accesible.There was a very large function being held whilst we were there which necessitated the lawn area being closed and the outlook from the dining room and terrace being ruined. The general noise and disruption ruined our stay.The swimming pool area is drab and hidden away and there are now completely useless shops for the visitor (European and American visitors need an overpriced Chanel outlet like a hole in the head!).The Hotel car service to the airport is extremely expensive.The staff give the attitude that this is the greatest hotel in the world and you are very lucky being here. This attitude was exemplified by the reaction of the cashier when I was checking out. He asked me if I had enjoyed my stay and when I said 'not as much as usual' he smiled an automatic smile without listening, expecting a yes, it took him some 10 seconds to register what I had said. On the plus side the common areas of the hotel are quite beautiful and we ate very well at the Spice Route restaurant.I was impressed by the quick response by the General Manager to my email of disappointment but my advice is go and eat there to enjoy the fabulous public areas but do not stay in this now outrageously expensive hotel "
the imperial ,"Great hotel but bad upgrade tax charges. We stayed at The Imperial during August 2007. It was recommended to us by a couple of our friends and families. We were offered free upgrade to a better room upon check in. The lobby outside our room had some strange smell but over all it was nice. However, we were shocked at the bill when we checked out. The tax they charged us is to the upgrade room price, which is double the price. We then had to pay more for the room. Thank god we were not on a tight budget. We haven’t been to a hotel anywhere that charges you more on a “free” upgraded room. It’s a five star hotel, act like one. Let your customer know before you give them a “free” upgrade. Maybe they won’t choose to have the upgrade. It just left a bad taste in your mouth since everyone wants to cheat you in India, including a reputable hotel. "
the imperial ,"Fantastic stay - although it hits your wallet Fantastic hotel and a great experience. Rooms are wonderful and comfortable with no faults.However, for a 5-star hotel it's a bit diasappointing that they add quite excessive charges for their facilities (for example, 2 minutes of internet cost £4.).Restaurants and bars are also a bit too expensive with the famoue Spice route not as good as a 'Above Average' london curry house "
the imperial ,"elegant hotel After driving through the chaotic streets of Delhi, the Imperial is a welcome and calm oasis. This 5 elegant hotel has everything you expect from a 5 star hotel. The rooms are spacious and beautiful and the service is top notch. The spice route restaurant has a great interior with great food. The terrace is a beautiful place to have breakfast. The only thing we would do different is bring some nicer clothes to wear in the hotel, all of the guests were a bit older and all were quite elegant. We felt a bit underdressed at times. "
the imperial ,"Claridges in New Delhi We had an amazing stay whilst on our honeymoon. The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. The interior is delightful. Grand in every sense and better than most museums. The food and service was excellent and we would not hesitate in recommending or staying there again. "
the imperial ,"Beautiful Imperial The best in termsof location, look and service at pretty affordable porice compared to other same-class properties. The flowers' (roses) arrangements are superb. "
the imperial ,"Elegant hotel This is a grand hotel and has a feel of travelling back in time to the days of the Raj. The best description of the hotel interior in one word is elegant. The rooms are spacious and well presented. The staff superbly helpful and friendly.The restraints are all very nice and the food tasty and well presented. Down side in the restaurants was that people did smoke in them and I thought they were smoke free dinning rooms. A word of warning if eating on the terrace restaurant do keep an eye open aboveyou as we saw a large hawk take a meal from a woman’s plate. Not a complaint it was amusing but could be a bit alarming if you are the one it happens to. We used a tour company organised for us by American Express by the name of Abercrombie and Kent. I can recommendthem to all who are looking for a professional guide that makes you feel safe, important and caters to your needs. They organise a vehicle and guide speaking your language for you alone. It is not a shared service and they take you to the places you are interested in and do so with "
the imperial ,"Best Hotel in Rajasthan The best hotel we stayed in India. Very nice restaurants, good breakfast, nice room. Pool rather small could be nicer. "
the imperial ,"Indian Nightmare In January 2006, my wife and I scheduled a trip to India especially to be able to stay at the Imperial Hotel, a venue I had haunted with some frequency (viz., especially the bar) on my prior visits to New Delhi. Our initial five day stay went off without incident and the service was commensurate with the five star European prices we were obliged to pay. Upon our return for a layover in New Delhi en route from Udaipur to Shimla, the situation was less pleasant. Depsite confirmed reservations, the hotel informed us (using an airport driver whose English was extremely marginal) that we were being assigned to another hotel (the location and quality were never made clear) because the hotel was oversold. I insisted upon our return to the Imperial since we had left luggage there from our previous stay. The airport driver then falsely (in the manner so characteristics of Indians when faced with any unpleasantness) assured us that everything was o.k. Upon our arrival it quickly became clear that the hotel had no intention of honoring our reservation and were anxious to remove us from the property. It was late, we were tired and we had a very early train the next morning. Not only did the hotel never clarify where they were going to send us (the airport driver had made an imcomplete reference to a lower quality hotel by the airport) but they never offered to pay for the substitute room. We summoned a hotel marketing agent who had sat down with us at dinner the previous Tuesday. At the time she had fawned over us telling us how lovely it was that we were staying in the hotel and had offered us discounts and amenities we had no need for. The marketing agent was helpless and hopeless: all her promises from the preceding week had been hollow marketing blather. And so we stood our ground in the crowded lobby. I began to expound in my best Ciceronian diction on the several thousand dollars we had spent during our visit less than a week earlier, how we had confirmed reservations and how we would most assuredly report back to our friends and colleagues on this most inhospitable treatment. Faced with a raving travel weary American excoriating the hotel in the center of their lobby, management acted quickly and decisively to confirm our reservation and give us the room we had reserved. The marketing agent looked on in impotent silence.The Imperial may be a lovely hotel, but I have never before encountered a situation where the hotel staff was so pro-actively anxious to tell me how much they appreciated my business and how anxious they were to make my stay more enjoyable and simultaneously so utterly impotent in addressing a real and dire problem of the hotel's own making. Suffice it to say, all who would venture there are now forewarned "
the imperial ,"Among the best in the world It's difficult to say anything new about this well located five star plus historic hotel, an elegant and meticulously managed haven with art deco touches. We spent four days there, our second visit, and have no complaints except the overpriced internet service. All the staff we met were competent, friendly and helpful and our 'heritage' room was very comfortable and fully equipped. The print collection is extraordinary and it's worth visiting the hotel just to see the display in the public areas. The meals in 1911 were excellent but the Italian restaurant, while probably among the best in Delhi, probably wouldn't get this ranking in Italy. There's not much 'Indian' in the Imperial apart from the staff and some of the food but the hotel nevertheless has a more authentic feel than its nearby 'western' competitors. The pool area is adequate but relatively modest and contaminated by street noise (but the Imperial is not a resort). None of this style and service comes cheap. Highly recommended to travellers not on a tight budget. Tip - book your car/taxi with the head porter and if walking pay no attention to the touts on the street outside. "
the imperial ,"Arrogant staff Tax scam I’ll start with the best in that the hotel building and interior is very classy. By the worst – arrogant and snobby staff. They are not there to serve, they are there to do what they want to do.I was booked into the Intercontinental Nehru Place and it was too noisy so I went looking for a quiet hotel.I went to the Imperial and asked if there was any availability and if I could look at a room. The lady at the front desk seemed to be looking me up and down deciding if she would give me a room. She would screw her face up or give me a quizzical look when I expressed an opinion such as ‘the Intercontinental was too noisy’ or asked ‘how much was the room rate’. There didn’t seem to any rhyme or reason to it, more like it was dependent on her whims – one minute there were rooms, next minute they were fully booked. I was going to walk out at this stage but I had already been to the Oberoi and Sheraton who didn’t have availability, I’d been messed around by various taxi drivers in hot taxis between various hotels and it was late and I was getting desperate. She then decided I was up to scratch and showed me a room which was great and I agreed to take the room. She then took about 15 minutes to do the checkin and then gave me a different room to the one she showed me – just nuts – I asked for the room she showed me and she explained it wasn’t available then she upgraded me to another room. My room was a heritage suite and consisted of a separate lounge room and bedroom with nice furniture and wood floors. Each of the TV’s had a transformer/surge protector which hummed like a power station – I disconnected them. The room looked into the inner part of the hotel and as such there was no natural sunlight but very quiet. The only noise was from the piped music in the hotel which I would have to listen to as I lay in bed at night as it penetrated the window looking onto the lobby. The room was artic cold and I immediately turned off the aircon but then discovered there is ventilation into the room which you have no control over and this continues to pump cold air into the room. It really was cold so I slept in my clothes and rugged up to watch TV etc. I asked the next day for the ventilation to be turned off and after various people arriving and going they did turn it off so I was able to control the room temperature. The bed was good, the shower had good hot water. Internet connection was up and down – they charge Inr1200 + 12% per day i.e. US$36/day and it would have a good connection for 1 minute and then die for a minute and then come back to life. Sometimes it would just stop and would have to reboot– very annoying and not good enough to use skype. I downloaded a 31mb file and it took 80 minutes.Breakfast was a buffet but very good – Inr 844 plus they expect tips.Room service food was very ordinary – I do some Indian cooking and I think I could cook better than some of the meals they delivered.Room charge was Inr18,000 per day plus they charged taxes of 12.5% x room rack rate Inr 25,000 so Inr3,125 taxes – this is just a tax scam and there is no basis for this – the correct calculation is 18,000 x 12.36% and they know it. So Inr 21,125 plus internet plus breakfast you are looking at US$580 per night. This is just outrageous for what you get. It is a sort of hotel for people who like Mont Blanc pens/rolex watches etc. It is snobby and elitist and just not comfortable for someone like myself. The arrogance of the reception and the tax-scam give you a flavour of the type of people you are dealing with. Add to this an uncomfortable cold room and I will not be returning. It is tough to find a good hotel in Delhi as from what I can see they are all expensive and patchy quality but I think this place is better avoided – my next time I am going to try the Taj Palace as it has some good reviews. "
the imperial ,Worth It A wonderful location. The staff were very friendly and the room was out of this world. We felt very relaxed here. It is expensive but it's a real treat that makes it worth every last cent. No hesitation in suggesting this to anyone. 
the imperial ,"Couldn't ask for better! What a great place to stay in Delhi. We looked at a lot of reviews at various websites, including tripadvisor, and though it is quite pricy, decided to give it a go. No regrets whatsoever. Excellent ambience, and you are treated like royalty. The room was splendid in decor, and very well maintained. The staff were always available and eager to help. We even had a cake and a bunch of flowers presented to us for the wife's birthday. Having stayed at some hotels in Delhi in the past, I can honestly say that this one beats them all hands down. If you budget can stretch to it, spend at least a couple of days here, you won't regret it! "
the imperial ,"Great Experience and good location This is agreat hotel to stay in. The sevice is fantastic and it has a really lovely air about it - especially the breakfast service overlooking the imperial style lawn. The restaurants are great too and as a lone female traveller I was never made to feel uncomfortable. The staff helped me book my train tickets to Agra and back and also in getting me to the aiport. I have stayed at this hotel many times when on business in Delhi and I have only had 2 minor hiccups.. ONce my door lock did not work so I was moved to another room after an entertaining experience of having around 10 different people come to look at the lock and discuss what might be wrong with it, and the only other issue is when sometime housekeeping staff knock at your door to check that everything is ok quite a few times during the stay.. which in most Indian hotels is a kind of hint for a tip.. Like I say Ive stayed at lots of hotels in India and this does happen a bit so I still rate this as a minor hiccup. I would reccomend this place for business or pleasure travellers, its pricey but worth it. "
the imperial ,"One of the best reasons to visit Delhi This is a superb hotel - and if you are going to Delhi and want to treat yourself - this is the place to do it. The dining is wonderful with several options - some of the best Indian food I have ever eaten has been here. The rooms are wonderful - spacious and clean. The ambiance in the hotel is just very restful and elegant. At night centerpieces with candles are in the main hall intersections, during the day the candles are replaced with flowers. There are areas to meet to enjoy a drink with a friend - all with fine service. Forget check-in at the desk, a clerk escourts you to your room and fills out the paperwork after pointing out the amenities and seeing if you are comfortable. Where else is there a &quot;Pillow Menu&quot; ?(no kidding) - choose your favorite type of pillow. This same type of treatment is given thoughout.There are a few areas for improvement. Reservations in particular could use some help. I booked on Orbitz and even though I tried to communicate to the hotel several times they could not find the record. Finally they did, and I was informed by email that everything was OK - when I arrived the airport pick up was not arranged - there was a staff member from the hotel stationed at the airport - who was very kind, and arranged for a &quot;taxi&quot; but it was not the hotel car (and not the same price either) so it was all ok.... he was very kind to two weary travelers - but it should not have been a problem in the first place. A similar confusion was met at the front desk before they &quot;found me&quot; (even after the phone call from the airport from their own staff member) and then I was wisked upstairs as described - all was good. Then on checkout - a similar problem - they did not show me as pre-paid, and it took a while to striaghten it out. Again, very professionally handled but it should not have been necessary in the first place.I rebooked for our return on the hotels web site. Be careful - they require 72 hour notice for cancellation. I unfortunately had to cancel due to flight changes, and I again had a confusing back and forth email interchange where they told me to cancel through the booking agent used - but the agent was THEIR web site that did not allow me to cancel due to the several days of back and forth that occurred. Email interactions with the hotel take 24 hours - agan too slow for a Hotel of this caliber. They did straignten it out - eventually - but these types of things should not be a problem and mars an exceptional hotel visit. But let's put things into perspective. Even with this confusion - this is just a great hotel - and worth every penny.... Luxury tax or not. "
the imperial ,"First time love but second date blues We booked to stay at the Imperial twice. On our arrival in Dehli we couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. The style and ambience of the hotel gave it a great deal of charm and character. The room, service and breakfast was everything you would expect from a high class establishment. The location is great for walking to Connaught Place but if you want to travel further I suggest you walk a few minutes away from the main gate to get an auto rickshaw as the opening price drops considerably before hangling begins. Things however were not so pleasant on our return. We were due to stay here again on our last night before flying home, arriving around midnight on the train from Agra. On arrival we were told, despite having made the reservation at the same time as our earlier visit, that the hotel was full (government delegation) and that we would need to transfer to another hotel (The Park ).Given the lateness of the hour we reluctantly agreed only to find that this hotel was not a patch on the Imperial despite our being upgraded to a suite. In the morning therefore we returned to the Imperial to complain about our treatment. To their credit they did try to make amend by giving us the use of a room for the afternoon (our flight was in the evening), a complimentary meal in the Spice Routes restaurant and a transfer to the airport. However double booking is not something I expect from five star establishmentsOverall if you get to stay at the Imperial you will love it but be aware that they may not honour your booking. "
the imperial ,"Beware - Hotel Tax SCAM At checkout - all guests find out that there has been a 12.5% luxury tax applied to their bill which is standard in India. The SCAM is that The Imperial applies the 12.5% tax to the RACK RATE not the room rate that we were charged. Our nightly rate was $189, but the luxury tax applied was based on a $450 room rate. For two nights, this was more than $100. This tax situation is never mentioned when you book your room or when you check in, you find out when you check out. We also stayed at The Park Hotel in Delhi - and they are doing the same SCAM to their customers, but in their case we were charged 12.5% of a $300 rack rate (about $75 for two nites), when our room rate was $168. This proves that the RACK RATES are randomly assigned and have no basis in reality. The hotel staffs say that everyone who checks out has the same bad reaction. Who wouldn't? This is unacceptable from any hotel, especially on this level.Since The Imperial is a Preferred Hotel, we will be reporting this situatiuon to them. In addition, The Imperial is often selected as one of the best hotels in the world by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel &amp; Leisure magazines, we plan to inform them as well. "
the imperial ,"The best place to stay in Delhi I'd definitely recommend the Imperial as the best place to stay in Delhi. True, the Oberoi and the Shangri-La are probably even more luxurious, but neither of them has a tenth of the character of the Imperial. I stayed in a suite, which was breathtaking. But the standard rooms are excellent too. The restaurants are the best in New Delhi, especially the Spice Route. The buffet lunches are also not to be missed - if you can't afford to stay here, it's well worth dropping in for a lunch or afternoon tea. The standard of service is absolutely top-notch, and the hotel's interior is one of the most beautiful anywhere in the world - and scrupulously clean. I couldn't have enjoyed this place more. "
the imperial ,"Love it but with this reservation... Since moving to India, we have stayed there a handful of times but our last stay virtually mirrored our first stay nearly two years ago..... We arrived for a three night period and were met at the airport by driver AND greeter who escorted us to the hotel, where greeter swiftly disappeared after a few quick words with the front desk ... As we tried to check in, we were asked to take a seat in the lobby for a few minutes, after which time, a member of staff asked us to join him in a very quiet area of the restaurant. What had we done? Were our visa's not right? Had the corporate rate increased? None of the above. We were advised that a 'government delegation' had overstayed its welcome and would we mind being 'shifted' to the Shangri La (not shabby) two minutes down the road, just for one night. We negotiated a room upgrade and a complementary dinner, plus we were staying another two nights so all was not lost. Fast forward to July 4th this year.... we arrived at the hotel at 9pm with a booking at 9.30pm in their fabulously lauded and expensive Spice Route restaurant. As the receptionist pulled up our booking (which was made on the hotel's website a few months prior) the words BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE flashed across her screen. When I asked what it meant, she quickly closed the screen and called the duty manager, who arrived with the familiar request to 'take a seat in the lobby...' This time we were ready! No, was our answer, let's sort it here... then came the old 'government delegation' chestnut. We refused to budge. It was the July 4th holiday and we were eating in a half hour. No way! Well, they asked, could we check out at 7am? No way! We were leaving on an international flight at 1pm. At which time, the duty manager 'scuttled away' (there is no finer way of putting this) without a word of an apology, leaving the receptionist to hand us our keys and show us to our room. Not a pleasant start to our short stay and one which, I have to say, has left me thinking of moving hotels next time we are in Delhi. We did file a complaint with the hotel and posed questions on their criteria for 'bouncing' guests to which we received a very hasty letter of apology in the mail - but no comped night or dinner!!! "
the imperial ,"one of the best hotel to stay I stayed at the imperial for a week at the beginning of July 2007 just after having spent few days at the Grand,intercontinental that I decided to leave after seeing the Imperial: what an excellent decision it was! At the Imperial everything was fantastic: the staff, the terasse of 1911 brasserie facing a peacfull garden, the spiceroute restaurant and its mysterious atmosphere, the swimming pool where squirrels and birds are playing, ... Althought I was working, I was there with my partner and it was a very romantic place to stay. It is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Go there and enjoy. "
the imperial ,"Overall an excellent property especially for colonial atmosphere just stayed a total of 7 nights here in june 07. after watching all the different opinions about delhi hotels in the last few months and after going back and forth, decided to try the imperial due to the elegant colonial atmosphere and the good location for walking around. we were not disappointed. being low season, rates were excellent, booked at the hotel website, just over $200 for the larger heritage rooms. the history and elegance of the hotel is just great, and the staff rates about a 9.0 or 4.5 depending on which scale you are using. i found none of the attitude problems a few others have mentioned. one of the concierges pointed us a new deluxe shopping center for luxury designer ladies clothing, the Crescent, which was the highlight of my wife's visit! many top designers featured in the indian fashion magazines have recently moved here from an older area that was demolished, and we certainly would not have found it without his assistance. all other staff members were always friendly and helpful. sometimes you definitely find some minor communications problems, and considerable shyness with some staff, who look like they are newcomers to the industry. but with a bit of patience and a smile you will get what you want. i would agree that there are a few corners of the hotel and some areas in some rooms that need renovated, but in general the hotel is shining and polished with luxury. in our second visit the towels seemed especially worn for a deluxe property, and the rather cheap plastic hanging shower curtain was out of place. but in both rooms the water pressure was excellent, we had no problems with drains or discolored water. keep in mind that the indian govt apparently charges very high taxes on all hotel services, as others have mentioned. you need to add about 20% to the confirmed room rate to get a true idea of cost, and the same thing is added to hotel limo and other services. but this seems to be clearly stated at all indian hotels so it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. we booked airport pickup both times with the hotel and it was handled flawlessly. we did not have breakfast as we were always busy taking off for somewhere, but i did walk through the buffet breakfast one morning and would agree that the selection was not bad but not what it should be. we had several meals at the 1911 restaurant, which were all excellent and the service the same.... expensive, sure, but you are at one of india's finest hotels! the location is one of the best for walking around the connaught circle shopping area, one of the better ones for street shopping with a minimum of street hassles. each street has its own gang of urchins who are all taught the same lines. curiously, after a day or two of totally ignoring them, we weren't hassled anymore, which shows that they spread the word that you aren't worth the trouble! one afternoon in old delhi we found a new scam.... a crazy looking guy started following down the street talking to us, and after a couple of blocks someone who was probably his cohort came along and said that he was accusing us of using his rickshaw without paying. anyway he was quite persistant, so we reached the red fort where there was a police post, and i told them that this guy was harrassing us. he calmed down a bit and we took a tuk-tuk out of the area. getting back to the imperial, i suppose the only criticism i would make is that having one of the most magnificient properties in the country, they should spend the money and make it 100% flawless and updated, instead of just 85-90%. this comparison was brought home after a few days at the fabulous rambagh palace hotel in jaipur (see my review if you are heading to jaipur), where you can search high and low and not find a single spot of the hotel that isn't perfectly clean, polished and of the most luxurious material. in delhi, the taj mahal has more ostentatious luxury, but the rooms are more standard business style. but if you are looking for an elegant, historic and colonial atmosphere, and a good location, i think you will be quite happy at the imperial as long as you don't expect perfection. "
the imperial ,Great location and good rates Stayed here for 3 nights in a very hot June.shop around for rates - I got $180 a night which is very good for this top class hotelwatch out for the tuk tuk drivers who want to take you to the tourist shops rather than the 'real markets' - once you emphasise that you do not want an air conditioned tourist shop they are fine.visit the marke in old Delhi on a tuk tuk for a real treat - I gave the driver 350 rupees for the day and he was very pleased - 1500 gets you an air conditioned car for the day with a driver - 5200 if you get the hotel to book it!the hotel is very cool - ac everywhere and the staff are excellent - the bar can be a bit pricey but is very relaxing and the terrace is great 
the imperial ,"First night in India I had so been looking forward to the first night of our holiday at this 'grand' hotel. Check-in was efficient and the jasmine perfume wafting through the air-con was impressive. However, by the next morning after breakfast, I could well do without its cloying aroma! Our Heritage room was large and well-furnished with a good dressing area and bathroom. Our first disappointment was when we tried to book a table at the Italian Restaurant and were told there was nothing until 10.30pm. No alternative was offered to us. After venturing out, we returned to find the Brasserie where our meal was OK, but the service was not exactly marvellous. More time should be spent on customer service than on perpetuating the days of the Raj and colonialism.Breakfast service was generally slow and apart from the freshly-cooked eggs - virtually stone cold. We did enjoy the art work in the corridors and the luxurious feel of the hotel, but The Imperial seems to be living on a past reputation. "
the imperial ,"Yes Yes YES to the Imperial Awesome, albeit short stay at the Imperial last summer.I flew into Delhi for one night last summer en route to Punjab.This was my first stamp in the passport and I was traveling alone! I booked a heritage room on the hotel website and also arranged for hotel car pickup at the airport. I was extremely nervous about this trip for a lot of reasons but the Imperial really helped me along.The car service man was exactly where they said he'd be with my name clearly visible. The greeters at the hotel entrance were friendly and helpful with my luggage - and I had a lot! Upon checking in, the staff upgraded me from a heritage room - to a Luxury Suite!! Can you say fabulous!??!!?I ordered room service - India hasn't mastered the art of the meatless burger - but it was more for curiosity than a fault of their own. I did have to pay for in-room internet but it was wireless and a negligible amount of rupees so no biggie there. I am headed back to Punjab this summer and will definitely be staying there again. Such a seamless experience!You really can't go wrong booking this property. Rates are much lower in the summer cause it's extremely hot there at that time but if you're going in the summer and can snag a great rate, def choose the Imperial. "
the imperial ,"Not so great We finished a seven week trip to India at the Imperial, having stayed at a wide range of accommodations, from small, family run places to opulent hotels like the Imperial and the Lake Palace in Udaipur. We had heard good things about the Imperial from friends and from TripAdvisor, so we decided to finish off our time in india with a splurge.I did book on the hotel's website, and I believe strongly in full information so on that website, agreed to pay $409 for one night and $509 for another. A quick tip: if you do a search on the website and are flexible in your dates, look at the rate from day to day because it changes considerably. As I said, we stayed in a few other very nice places in India, including the Lake Palace, Devi Garh (both in Udaipur) and Ananda in the Himalayas. Each of these, in my opinion, were more worth the money than the Imperial. While the Imperial rooms and common spaces are fantastically beautiful, it wasn't an &quot;experience&quot; as much as a beautiful place to stay.The concierge, as opposed to other reviews, was helpful to me in sending a box of mine to the USA. (I haven't seen the contents of the box so I'm just assuming all my things got there OK.) Although he had promised to get me a tracking number and I had to go back to him to get it. We ate one lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurants - lunch was quite expensive but decent, dinner at the Spice Route was decent too but nothing spectacular. The service was OK, but not as attentive as you might expect.Basically, when you book this hotel, you're bound to have really high expectations given the amount you're paying, and generally, it's a fancy hotel but it doesn't blow you away. We stayed at the Taj in Delhi for two nights too at a different point in our stay - it doesn't have the same feel but is plenty luxurious and costs a lot less - about $250 a night, with a much better gym and pool too.My opinion? Save your money for the once-in-a-lifetime places and have a meal or drink (tea) at the Imperial to see it. "
the imperial ,"Everything it should be Arrived early Sunday morning, met at the airport by two very spacious cars(some confusion as we had two rooms, but one was for the kids, only charged for one car). Check in was fast and efficient. Had interconnecting Heritage rooms. These were huge and very well furnished, including large B &amp; O plasma TV with DVD. Large modern bathrooms. Breakfast was buffet and/or to order, very large airy room, with oudoor terrace. The two main restaurants (one Thai/one Indian) were excellent - note dress code of formal casual which means no shorts, trainers or jeans. Room service was also good. Swimming pool area was sheltered and clean and service was good, complementary cold water and towels arrived as you sat down. Cocktails were also available.Big old hotel but perfectly maintained. A taste of colonial times? In the heart of New Delhi with some great little local shops just up the road.Used hotel car and driver for New Delhi tour, very well informed. Took guide for Old Delhi tour for extra info about fort etc. NB main monuments/museums are closed on Mondays. My favourite visit was Humayan's tomb - a hint of what the Taj Mahal is like - we did this on our own but there are lots of information signs. "
the imperial ,"Lururious oasis amidst chaos We stayed here 3 different times during March. The hotel and its grounds were a welcome respite from noisy, dirty, New Delhi just outside the wall. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The Heritage rooms on the second floor are bigger and nicer than those on the first floor. Turn down service is to die for! The breakfast buffet is excellent and the waiters are very attentive - we even had breakfast with one of the stars of Desperate Housewives and his partner! The Spice Restaurant is excellent and the ambience is inviting. Even room service was fast and the food was great. We will certainly stay there again. "
the imperial ,"Comfortable stay but unimpressive food The Imperial is a royal treat, no doubt. But the hotel mostly has its ambience and decor to flaunt, because after that it is mostly downhill. The hallways remind you of the history of the hotel and its grand heritage, but the standard rooms are cold, uninviting and small. My TV didnt work, but was too busy to bother complaining, but at other times the staff was quite responsive. However, you can forget about getting an iron in the morning rush. The bathrooms drains need a bit of work. I got two different rooms, but neither had a properly draining shower or sink. But my biggest complaint is with the food available inside the hotel. The much-advertised Spice Route is quite ordinary, but horrendously expensive. Daniel's Tavern is actually better. But the more casual 1911 restaurant has a menu that is too small to keep your interest for more than a couple of days, and most of the servings are bland, fried or just downright tasteless. However, the breakfast buffet selection is quite good. "
the imperial ,"Dreadfully disappointing It is with much regret that I write about the serious decline of the service at The Imperial hotel on Janpath. Having stayed here four times in the last four years, for a couple of weeks at a time, it was one of my favourite hotels in the world. Even two years ago, it was still an elegant oasis in the midst of a fabulous, bustling city, with cool corridors, good if pricy food, and a sense of time stood still. Well, time has definitely stood still, and the staff and management are resting on their laurels. The maitre d’ of the coffee shop restaurant had a stand up row on Saturday 17th March with one of my Indian friends which was both shocking, hostile, and embarrassing; my friends ended up writing a letter of complaint to the hotel manager which, of course, has gone unanswered. The maitre d' a few days later accused me of avoiding him, although he had the grace to confess that he'd been &quot;having a bad day.&quot; At breakfast each morning, staff were slow and ungracious; and they stood around watching whilst the crows in the garden came and stole food off punters’ plates, instead of responding to the cries of many frightened American women to shoo the birds away (I know this bird-problem of old, and eat inside). Most staff, it has to be said, judging by their conversations with each other, had been up all night watching India get thrashed in the World Cup Cricket, which might account for their total lack of customer service. I had lots of problems with the sound proofing of my bedroom (this is not the hotel for a quiet, uninterrupted night’s sleep), and despite informing house-keeping of my desire for no air-con (a little quirk of mine), every day I would return home from doing voluntary work in psychiatric clinics to find my air-con had been on all day and my room was now an arctic igloo (my room, 339, gets no sun during the day). By Wednesday, I’d had enough, checked out, and asked for the three remaining nights I’d paid for to be reimbursed. At check out, Akhil Arora the duty manager confirmed to me (and on the phone my Delhi-based travel agent) that this money would be reimbursed.My husband and I are now in protracted email negotiations with the hotel manager who has reneged on this promise to refund us our money. By accident my husband has been copied in on an email from the manager telling his deputy to hush-up the matter. I am shocked that a hotel of this calibre can treat guests, particularly a woman travelling on her own, in such a rude and complacent manner. But I was not alone. I overheard several people at reception complaining about the concierge, and about the poor sound-proofing of the bedrooms.If the hotel was so wonderful, I might be able to understand the conceit of the staff. But compared to other hotels in Delhi - which offer more lavish buffet breakfasts, interesting social programmes for guests, bigger pools, a spa (at The Imperial, I had to have my foot massage seated upright in the ladies hair salon; the Imperial has been ‘about to build a spa' for the last 3 years), maybe an arcade of local shops if that’s your thing (The Imperial has a newsagent, and a Chanel boutique (!) in the corner of the lobby, and in two years I have never seen anyone go inside), or even a gym (The Imperial’s “gym” is half a dozen pieces of equipment in a converted bedroom) – The Imperial no longer has anything unique or special to offer expect perhaps its location, being close to the railway station, and the shopping areas of Janpath, and Connaught Place – all of which are an inexpensive taxi or tuk-tuk ride away from all the other major hotels. British friends who used to stay at The Imperial for months at a time when working no longer do so, speaking of a serious decline in standards, as the best staff leave to work in real estate (one of Delhi’s booming industries). The Grand Hyatt, The Oberoi, or the new Shangri-La are now their hotels of choice. Local friends of mine deplore The Imperial’s smugness, and fear that people will think all Indians are like this. They are not. Try another Delhi hotel, and experience proper Indian hospitality. Don’t be fobbed off with faux-grandeur, and money-grabbing grandiose conceit from the staff at The Imperial. "
the imperial ,"Nice facilities spotty service beware internet booking!!! Stayed at this hotel last autumn while on a business trip to the Indian capital. Should note that during that trip I stayed at four other hotels in New Delhi...I am a travel junky and wanted to comparethe slew of new properties which have opened or been renovated duringthe travel boom of the past few years.Positively, the Imperial's facilities are top notch...comparable to what you would find in New York, London or Hong Kong with real (albeit forced) colonial-raj style. This comes at a price. Mumbai andDelhi hotels command London rather than Asia pricing given the bizarre land tenure regulations in India which results in a chronic shortage of rooms in major business centers. A comparable hotel in Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney or Bangkok would be half the price.Negatively, booked through the &quot;hotel's&quot; website. A glitch caused two identical rooms to be booked for the same night. I tried to rectify by a telephone call and e-mail (not wanting to rely on the web site). When I arrived, I found I had two rooms booked, but was assured that something would be done. The hotel was well attended, but not full. I checked out the next day, but when coming back the next week I found I had been charged for the empty room...basically US$300 out of my pocket, not reimbursable. I protested, but was told nothing could be done, with the hotel blaming the &quot;Leading Hotels of the World&quot; which &quot;runs&quot; its website. Thirty years of travelling through the best hotels in the world, and never been treated so poorly and disingenuously by a front desk.With pretensions to &quot;world class&quot; this hotel will need to clean up its act at the edges. Flat screen TV's and faux-raj trimmings will only go so far if it is to maintain its inflexible pricing and reservation policies. "
the imperial ,"unhelpful staff Although this was a fabulous hotel, my boyfriend and I were surprisedto find that we were shockingly overcharged by the hotel. We were quoted rates in U.S. dollars for both nights at $300 &amp; $400, respectively. We were never given a rate in rupees nor were we ever told that the price in U.S. dollars would in fact be much higher if we actually paid in U.S. dollars and not in rupees. In addition, we were never told that we were getting the rooms at a &quot;discounted rate&quot;and that we would actually be taxed at a $475 rate per night. We havelodged complaints with the hotel and they have ignored our request for an explanation of why we were quoted a price in U.S. dollars ($700 plus tax = $787.50) and in fact charged $908. Our experience at this wonderful hotel has been soured by this &quot;unwestern&quot; way of doing business - quoting one price and charging another without any explanation. "
the imperial ,"Walk back in time We recently stayed 4 nights at this hotel which was like walking back in time. From the greeting by a turbaned doorman, to perfumed and candle lit lobbies and hallways, the place was elegant, pristine and gracious. Beautiful carpets, marbled floors, lndian prints, sculpture and photos going back to the maharajah rule and colonial time were everywhere -better then any art gallery. An elegant buffet breakfast is served and one can dine inside or outside on a lovely patio overlooking lawn and gardens which is an oasis in the middle of bustling noisy city. The Spice Route restaurant is beautiful with fine food and service. While not inexpensive, it was fairly priced for what was provided.We stayed in a Heritage room which was good sized, with a large marbled bathroom and soaking tub, as well as a mini-bar. Quality amenities, such as lotions and shampoos were plentiful. Turn down service was nightly which included bottled water and a goodie on the pillow. Down duvets and pillows rounded out the experience. There is a outdoor pool for those wanting to swim. This place was a haven in the midst of Delhi and a lovely experience to stay. "
the imperial ,"Something special We stayed at the Imperial for the first and last nights of our India holiday. This is one of the best hotels I have ever experienced, in terms of character, comfort and service, and though expensive for India it is very good value. The whole place was renovated about 10 years ago without losing its 1930s style and charm. The location couldn't be better, it is a far better bet than any of the international chain hotels out on the airport road.The only word of warning is: look out for the restaurant prices. We asked where we could get a light lunch on our first day, were directed to the buffet. £50 for what was basically a snack for two was completely ridiculous! Only average food as well, though our breakfasts were superb and included in our deal.Your travel agent can probably book for less than you will pay booking online "
the imperial ,"Impressive service This hotel has an colonial elegance style to it. We booked through the hotel directly (cheaper) so we managed to get a free car pick up from the airport ,it was great to just get off the plane and not have to fight to get a taxi , We arrived at 8 am in the morning and the upgrade room (older style) was ready for us when we checked in , Truely Amazing Room !!! , The service is first class in all areas . We had pre booked the Spice Route Restaurant in the hotel as it was our wedding anniversary that evening, this is the Thai / Eastern Restaurant , Dont bother ,the service was rubbish and the food very average , the price is expensive for what you get. But 10 minutes before we left the hotel manager walked a round the restaurant and suddenly all the staff came to life but we were leaving by then . So we left the restaurant very deflated for the1911 bar, we told the waiters how dissappointed we were with the restaurant with it being our anniversary as we ordered our drinks , 10 minutes later they have a full cake in front of us , 2 glasses of champagne singing etc it was so lovely , The bar supervisor Adishek had arranged for the restaurant Manager to come and see us. The manager was so apologetic &amp; she brought a lovely craved woodern box of spices and more champagne. She managed to handle a tricky situation correctly &amp;pull back our view on the situation. The following day we took a metered taxi cab from the front of the hotel around all the sights , Red fort , Jama Masjid (big Mosque) , India Gate and Humayun's Tomb,(this is brilliant do not miss it out). Shopping is good at the Cottage Emporium straight accross the road from the hotel (get both gifts,woodern &amp; bronze ,carpets, paintings &amp; Indian style clothes Kaftans etc.In the evening we went to the hotels Indian restarant Daniel's , It was truely amazing!! , Food excellent , atmosphere great ,live Indian music playing and service brilliant but unintrusive. This is by far the better restaurant, would highly recommend along with guys in the 1911 bar. The Buffet Breakfast is included with the room price in the 1911 restaurant so dont miss out on this as this is also excellent &amp; good to fill up on before a days sight seeing (sit outside on terrace when sunny , its lovely outside). The pool was closed during our stay which is really dissappointing as a dip mid afternoon would be briiliant but they class january as winter (80F) and think its cold so they close the poolThis is an brilliant olde worldly hotel with excellent service and i would definately recommend this over an ultra modern hotel in delhi . Enjoy!!! "
the imperial ,"Total 30's opulence This was our first port of call on our Golden Triangle &quot;tour&quot;. The hotel cannot be faulted and they have created a 30's feel which I would imagine is very difficult to recreate. Better than anything Hollywood could do!I recommend you have dinner in the Spice Route as it looked wonderful but we could not get in as we were only staying two nights and it was fully booked. If you know you are going to this hotel, phone a couple of weeks ahead or e mail them.Our room was a Heritage Suite and beautifully appointed.The staff were attentive and polite.The grounds outside were very colonial in feel. Lovely.If you want a stay in Delhi in the best hotel....look no further. Stay here!!!One tip....You MUST go to the Bukara Restaurant in the Sheraton. Best Lamb I have ever had and a unique dining experience. In many ways, we were glad we could not get into the Spice Route as the Bukara (I think that's how it is spelt!) was just wonderful. Go about 7pm and you should get in. They had a weird booking set up which I could not get to the bottom of but if you are going to go, then go early. You will love it!! "
the imperial ,"nice hotel surly concierge Really nice hotel, but considering that you're in Delhi, it's a fantastic hotel. Beautiful rooms and hall ways. Concierge service, however, needs a lot of work. The main older guy is just really unpleasant, but there is one nice young guy who occasionally mans the desk. Mostly, we had to deal with the older (middle-aged) surly guy, who gave us inaccurate information. Most of the other staffs are nice. By and large, it's the best hotel in Delhi (we stayed at 3: Imperial, Oberoi, and Radisson). "
the imperial ,"Wonderful! This is definately one of the best hotels (if not THE best) in Dehli. Hotel Imperial has a wonderful location on Connaught Place, near bazaars and restaurants, good service and rooms with great decor. Although our plane was late for two hours, hotel driver was waiting us in the airport at 4 o´clock in the morning, as our room rate included airport transfer as well.We had a fantastic heritage room with beautiful big bathroom and Fragonard amenities. Daily fresh fruits were a nice little extra. As I don´t like indian food so much, we had a dinner in San Gimignano garden restaurant first evening, where the food was excellent and we also enjoyed our breakfasts in beautiful patio. Only the swimming pool area is not that attractive, but then again – it is a city hotel, so swimming pool is not the reason why to go to Imperial. And they had an excellent service there afterall. They also have a wonderful pastry shop near the lobby and an absolutely gorgeous art collection. Imperial calls herself &quot;museum-hotel&quot; and organizes sightseeing tours to the hotel. Everything was clean and nice and I would suggest that hotel to anyone without any hesitation. "
the imperial ,Excellent Hotel This hotel is truly excellent and has taken its rightful place in my top ten hotels in the world.The staff could not be more helpful and everything about this hotel excudes charm and service. The sandwiches in the bar are a little marginal but that is the only critism I could make. All of the drinks in the bar and peanut / snacks were great. The Spice Route restuarant serves great Thai food and this was not hugely expensive. Good value for money. 
the imperial ,"Nice but... Initially, we thought this hotel was outstanding...we loved the decor, style and atmosphere...a reall oasis in dirty/bustling Delhi. I would agree with other reviewers that some staff (particularly the restaurant staff) could come across as aloof and snobby. But it was very competent and never rude so I suspect this was either their natural demeanor or the way they've been trained. Unlike some other readers, we loved our meals at the Spice Route...and the decor is something to write home about...the detail was incredible...supposedly took 7 years to build.While our room looked beautiful at first blush, I noted that they had an electric air freshener in the room on the first night. Everything smelled OK. On the second night the air freshener was gone and room started to smell a bit like the bathroom...there's an open drain in the bathroom that I suspect was connected to all the waste water piping and my guess is this didn't drain properly so toilet water was staying in the pipe and producing a smell through the open drain. It wasn't too bad when we went to bed and we were leaving the next morning so we didn't complain...but by the time we woke up, it was quite pungent. So it seems they have some plumbing problems...something to think about.Lastly, if you eat on the patio, keep your eyes peeled for hawks...I couldn't believe it but one of this relatively large birds that circles the sky over the city dive bombed a table (4 business men) and snatched some food right of someone's plate. Quite exciting to watch and I'm sure a huge shock for the people at the table... "
the imperial ,"The Best Hotel I've Stayed In If you've had enough modern high rise 5 star hotels like The Claridges and want a feeling of history without getting a hotel that shows the ravages of time, this is the hotel.Beautifully decorated, spacious, great art work, impeccable service without getting in your way. Go for a Heritage Room if you want space, comfort and a homey colonial feeling. Don't miss the Spice Route restaurant and ask for a tour of the restaurant if they aren't too busy. Breakfasts were superb.We wrote a glowing report in their customer evaluation form, but got a letter from the manager on our return apologizing for any discomfort or inconvenience we may have encountered. Something got lost in translation, I suppose. "
the imperial ,"Terrific city hotel Booked direct, changing dates and rooms etc, but all no problem. We loved the bustling bars and meals in the indian and fusion restaurants were jolly good. The staff were charming and the location for shopping excellent. Breakfast outside was a lovely start to the day and the best breakfast we had in India Our deco- suite was sumptuous. We took the hotel car and found the drivers helpful. "
the imperial ,Beautiful! The Imperial (Dehli)-This hotel was gorgeous. We spent two nights here. The breakfast was delicious and the room was spectacular. I absolutely love marble and this hotel has so much. The British Colonial decor is really wonderful. 
the imperial ,"Old World Glamour Great Chef but spotty service Of all the high-end hotels I stayed in New Delhi, I felt this was the most beautiful. It had history and maintained its old-world glamour. The restaurant, Brasserie 1911 was first class, the service extremely attentive and the Chef, who came out to check on the meal and discuss his background was wonderful. However, at breakfast, the staff was less than friendly, and seemed annoyed to have to work. It's not like it wasn't their job, there were no glasses or plates set up at the front to help yourself either. We had to ask for tea at least three times from three separate people. When I returned, they had packed up all of my luggage, (I had specifically left clothing out to change into when I returned) and taken it away, with no notice whatsoever so I thought I had been robbed. (I had not NOT requested that anyone take my luggage at all, but they knew I would be checking out that day). Compared to the Taj Mahal and the Taj Palace, the service here was the weakest, but overall, it wasn't bad. "
the imperial ,"Beautiful Hotel The hotel is REALLY LOVELY. I am a seasoned traveler who really enjoys the finer things in life. I found The Imperial very nearly immpecable. The entrance is attractive with creative fresh flower arrangements (hats off to the florist) and the halls of the hotel boast many beautiful prints and paintings. The heritage room in which I stayed was tastefully furnished with colonial style period furniture (2 single beds). Bed linens were comfortable and attractive. The bathroom was marble with a tub, but no separate shower. Overall the room was very pleasant and light, but sadly the windows in my ground floor room did not open so I did not get much fresh air. Also the tub clogged. I made a few complaints, but the problem didn't get resolved. The buffet breakfast was great, lots of selections of hot and cold foods, as well as an omlette station. The Thai/Indian restaurant was fantastic, though quite expensive even by hotel standards. Room service was great-always on time and always delicious. One major drawback was the horrible massage facility. It was noisy and seemed dirty-if you must have a massage go for the inroom massage option. The concierge is not well informed about happening restaurants or night clubs so do your own research. Also remember than in Delhi everyone gets a kickback for everything!!! The hotel is well situtated near shopping and restaurants. We tried a really nice lounge/restaurant called QBA in Coughnut (spelling?) area. Also dont forget when shopping-Bargain!!!! Overall the whole hotel experience was great. I am definately going back. "
the imperial ,"Really Over-rated. We spent 3 days at the Imperial in December 2006. All the advance press about it touts it as &quot;the best hotel in Delhi&quot;...Sure it looks great. But below the surface it's just mediocre. The staff while seemingly willing and friendly never manages to deliver on any request. Most of the rooms have windows on interior courtyards which means they're really quiet. If you get an outside view room be prepared for lots of noise. Including the bang bang of the staff fixing chairs while you're trying to recover from jeg lag. The Spice Route is claimed by Conde Nast Traveller to be one of the 10 best restaurants --- but clearly their reviewer has not been eating in any even middle of the road fusion restaurants in New York, London or Los Angeles. A good restaurant in any of these places wins hands down in a competition with the Spice Route. Where by the way the staff attitude is decidely unfriendly. Now let's talk about prices. Every meal was over priced but the most riduculous offense of all was that the Imperial charges as much for a bottle of domestic Indian white wine (Sula) as they do for an import from France or California: between US$60-70 for something you can buy on the street for US$8.00. Bottom line: over priced, over rated, under delivers. They clearly have contempt for their well travelled target market who all have enough experience to know this hotel is a sleekly packaged rip off. "
the imperial ,"Oasis It is highly recommended due to its reputation, and I'm actually fine with their practice of keeping those pesky tuk-tuk drivers off the premises. The facilities look opulent inside and the air smelled of lemon or giner in the halls, which is very refreshing after coming in from the pollution outside. The restaurants can get costly. I didn't think the Spice Market restaurant was anything to rave about. Decent, pricey and it was really dark in there! The pool was nothing special. The gym is small, but I enjoy small hotel gyms. The building is old of course, and the windows are pretty thin because one can hear all kinds of outside noises from the room. Bathing was quite an experience: I got dirtier than if I hadn't bathed because as I filled the tub, the water was yellow! To top it off, we were ripped off with the taxes at check-out (should have been based on the discounted rate that we reserved the room for and not based on full price!) Management didn't care to apologize or rectify this even after we lodged a formal complaint. Also, I think that having people constantly open the entrance doors seems a bit pesky and impractical. Why not install automatic doors? "
the imperial ,"The only place for pure luxury in Delhi We have stayed at all the top hotels in India including Udaivilas, Rajvilas and Amarvilas and found that The Imperial more than holds it own. The hotel is full of authentic old photographs and furnishings but has been thoroughly renovated to a very high standard. We particularly recommend the heritage rooms if you staying with a child as the room is beautiful and very large to accomodate the third bed. In fact, we declined a heritage suite because the room was so good. The food is fantastic in Daniell's Tavern and we really enjoyed the life music. The food was among the best we've had in India and no health problems. The hotel is also surprisingly quiet and tranquil given that it is bang in the centre of New Delhi. Frankly, the only place to stay in New Delhi. I note another reviewer complained about the pricing but we never felt ripped off. The hotel is expensive but delivers. And if the security guards are hesitant about letting in autorickshaw at least it shows that are making a safe environment for guests. "
the imperial ,"Stay here to reminisce on past colonial glory only I had high expectations on booking this hotel based on past reviews and previous travellers to Delhi who saw the hotel from the outside.The trouble started even before we got there. Their pickup charge from Nizamuddin train station was INR 4000?!? So we took a normal taxi from the train station instead (cost: INR200 and we overpaid).When we got to the driveway, we were prevented from stopping in front of the lobby. Instead our taxi was directed away from the sheltered porch like some kind of pariah. Despite a 2 year old son in my arms, I had to call attention to my luggage.This was to happen 2 other times when we took an auto-rickshaw back to the premises of this rarefied &quot;high-class&quot; hotel even though by then it was obvious that we were guests. When I brought up this issue to the hotel manager, he was unapologetic and said things about how there are many beggars and such in India, and that auto-rickshaws (which run on LPG by the way) were a source of pollution.I think he really meant that &quot;proper&quot; guests at his wonderful hotel should not use Tuk-Tuks. Our interaction with the staff was characterised by this &quot;better-than-thou&quot; attitude. And this to paying guests mind you. They obviously treated caucasian guests better (I'm Singaporean) so if you like that kind of thing, you will be right at home.Even though we stayed in a suite, we had no view, and the bathroom was lousy (shower spurted at all the wrong places, bathtub stopper did not work). "
the imperial ,Great service An absolutely beautiful hotel - the 'museum hotel' in all its grandeur. The service is top rate; the restaurants are out of this world. I have stayed in five star hotels all over the world and would rate this at the top of my list for best overall. If I had to quibble with anything it would be the hard mattress but that is a minor complaint in an otherwise superb hotel experience. 
the imperial ,"Pretty Much Perfect After traveling in the North of India for work, this hotel could not have been more of a lifesaver. The room was gorgeous and very comfortable - fantastic bed and linens, beautiful marble floors and bath, excellent amenities. Had excellent meals both at Spice Route (a must just for the exotic decor) and the french bistro. Spent some time in the bar working on my laptop - service was attentive and very friendly. I felt extremely comfortable in this hotel despite it's imposing public rooms - I found the service had just the right tone. Highly recommended. "
the imperial ,"A restored masterpiece I had heard good things about The Imperial, but I was still genuinely surprised when the hotel car from the airport dropped us off. You would never for a second believe that the hotel is 75 years old – it looks brand new. The refurbishment has been total – every fixture, every fitting replaced, whilst retaining a 1930’s look. It is as good as Raffles in Singapore, and without the hordes of passing tourists (although tourists still seem to make up 90% of guests - very few suits). Acres of marble and hundreds of artworks line the corridors. The five restaurants offer a superb variety of food from around the world. Even the location is good (for a tourist) – right in the middle of New Delhi.The only problems surrounded our original room, a Deco Suite, which seemed to be cursed! The electronic door control wouldn’t work, the air con would not go off, the TV had a constant hum unless it was unplugged and, to cap it all, the room overlooked some noisy equipment on the roof of an adjacent hotel building. We were moved to a huge suite, with a combined steam room / shower and a Jacuzzi bath!If you stay here, I recommend hiring a green and yellow Delhi cab from the hotel rank for a day. It will cost around $10-$15 and is the easiest way to get around the New Delhi sites – Gandhi museum, Nehru museum, India Gate, parliament building, Hurmayan’s tomb (highly recommended) and Khan Market. If your flight departs very late at night, you can negotiate a very late check-out (11pm in our case) with the hotel for a charge. In summary, there are cheaper five star hotels in Delhi but none are as beautiful or offer the same variety of eating and drinking as The Imperial. "
the imperial ,"Beautiful City Retreat The Imperial is a beautiful hotel near Connaught Place. The hotel is a Art-Deco showpiece with beautifully appointed luxurious rooms. Don't opt for the Heritage Suites as they all face into courtyards or atriums - leaving the rooms dark and with no natural light or VIEWS. The most exquisite and expensive cave I've ever stayed in. The pool is especially nice as it is one of the few pools that is deep enough to dive into (11ft at the deep end) but unbelievably noisy due to the street traffic and has regular wafts of urine smeels drifting by. The food was ok in the varying restaurants but the wine list poor and horrendously expensive, the Shangri-La, however, has a fantastic East Asian restaurant with well priced food and a much better wine list. The bar there was also much cheaper. "
the imperial ,"Only stay at the Imperial if you are French! Horrible experience. Rude staff, downgraded overpriced hotel. They assumed that we didn't understand French, although my wife does.We were supposed to get a room upgrade if available, but were told that there were none. Next to us was a French couple speaking with the managers standing next to them. The manager told the French couple in French that they would be upgraded, and he would tell the desk clerk once we left the area.We will never stay her again, and go back to the Oberoi, who really have the best hotels in India. "
the imperial ,"Excellent hotel although a little over priced This hotel is an oasis of calm and sophistication and just about lived up to our expectations.We had booked into a Heritage Room, which was beautifully furnished and very large. The bathroom was however a little small for a room of this price ($430 per night). Our room was on the ground floor and, despite the hugest and most comfortable beds, we hardly slept due to noise from outside our window. We requested to be moved for our second night and we re-positioned in an identical room on the 3rd floor; much better.The hotel is furnished with loads of antiques, pictures and other objects that make it a very interesting place to walk round. The inner court-yard is a lovely place to have coffee or cocktail and the outdoor terrace restaurant (1911) seems to be the place in Delhi to have lunch. We found the food in the 1911 Terrace to be lovely, but the service to be some of the worst we had in India. Having said that, when we had breakfast the next day (which was amazing – a fantastic range of food) we were served very well.We ate in the Spice Route restaurant, which has very exotic decoration. The menu is from all over Asia and both the food and service were very good. We found the laundry service to be excellent. We phoned at 3pm for 3 garments to have express (2 hour) service. On handing over a blouse I pointed out a small tear, trying to show that I knew about the tear, so I would not be blaming them for it. The garments were returned 30 minutes later, pristinely pressed and the tear was mended!Overall, we felt that the rooms were slightly overpriced but we would definitely stay there again if in Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Luxury heritage hotel Luxury in Delhi. Vaste room, great service. convenient location for the centre of Delhi - Conaught place and the shops: The tibetan market is 2 min walk from the hotel (great for silk but bargain hard), and from the governemental shop- coutry cottage emporium, where prices are fixed (careful that at the exit of the hotel some guys will tell you that it is closed in order to draw you in his shop!). For food try the South East Asian restaurant but keep away from the Italian one. "
the imperial ,They dont come much better ...anywhere! Where would one start? One of the finest...worldwide. Service as you can only get in Asia. Massive suites. Superb restaurants ...def. try Spice Route and Daniells. Wonderful atmosphere and renovated to a very high standard. I shall stay no where else when in Delhi. 
the imperial ,"Imperial Blast--One problem after another Yes, it was overwhelmingly terrible. I'll be the one to push the envelope a bit with honesty and I don't care to be popular. Was in Delhi working for an extended period over the summer. Tried Spice Route a few weeks prior our stay at the Imperial and shouldve taken hint that it was indeed not as hyped-up as we thought--horrible service, maitre d'hotel made us wait with menus out in the foyer for 10-15 minutes after the time of our dinner reservation! Our stay for two nights: booked the heritage room and requested a top floor, instead we were relegated to the ground floor--they claimed all the other suites were booked. Fine. The room was OK, unpolished scratched-up wood parquet flooring--wouldve preferred the marble floors on the upper floors. Area rugs were not vacuumed everyday, even when requested. Our bath water was yellow, called the operator and they sent a plumber who just ran the water to clear the rust from the pipes (had to wait approx 30 minutes after he left for the water to clear). Shower water didn't drain fast enough from the stall, I don't particularly like soaking my feet in shower water. Dry cleaning service was abominable--asked to remove a stain from a newly tailored sari and said item was returned in the same condition. When we approached the laundry guy, he said he could take it back and douse it with kerosene to remove the stain! needless to say, we declined. Dining experience at the other hotel restaurant 1911 was hugely disappointing. Chinese dim sum dumplings stuck onto banana leaf and broke apart at the touch of a fork, hamburger was raw, and lobster bisque smelled of plastic. Manager Bilbao came over and tried to smooth things over--that was the nicest part of our stay but was not enough to undo the damage of an upsetting hotel and dining experience. He owes us dinner should we ever force to bring ourselves to the Imperial. Check out was a disaster: mistakenly charged for water from the fridge--which in fact was the bottled water we bought from outside since there was none when we first arrived. Buffet breakfast is good, though the waitstaff seemed to be in a frenzy and manager tried to show us the farthest table from the buffet in the sunroom and hesitated when we requested to be seated at one of the nearer tables in the main room. Other guests are not so nice and considerate. One family left their room door open to have their matters echo into the hallway. Oh, one last thing, Maria Shriver store me down at the breakfast buffet. How rude! "
the imperial ,"A Haven of Calm While living, studying and teaching in Delhi and Dehradun The Imperial Hotel became my haven of calm in the midst of India's seeming chaos.Between the years 1999 and 2005 I celebrated each of my own or my partner's birthdays there. We both enjoyed the hotel's attention to detail, and the importance of the guest's every pleasure and comfort. I was always touched by the fact that we were either given the same room from year to year (one we especially loved) or upgraded at no extra charge to a suite if the room we like so much was unavailable.On our birthdays we always found a birthday cake waiting in our room (no extra charge), plus flowers, our favourite drinks and snacks. This made entertaining friends very simple!We have used the hotel's fabulous lunch buffet on the outdoor terrace, overlooking the private garden for parties with friends. Each event went flawlessly. Food was/is always delicious and the service is always attentive yet not overbearing.This winter a trip to India is planned in December, and a birthday party at the Imperial is being looked forward to with much joy and anticipation. "
the imperial ,"Old Raj splendor This is a truly first-rate hotel, with a beautiful interior, great bars and restaurants, and luxurious rooms. Personal service/attention is top-notch, and I got comfortable (and complimentary) rides both to and from the airport. My only substantive complaints are two: First, the cashier put huge holds on my credit card that lingered even well after I had checked out and settled the bill. This was quite annoying, but may have been a fluke. Second, everything is ridiculously expensive, from minibar to restaurants. Still, if you have the rupees, you cannot do better than this! "
the imperial ,"Good hotel if your loaded This is a lovely hotel; clean, good facilities, excellent service, good food and a brilliant location. It is a great contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city and a good place to relax.The only downers are the slightly pompous clientele and the enormous prices. The owner of this place must make a fortune! "
the imperial ,"Not as good as other luxury hotels in India My wife and I stayed at the Imperial Hotel in mid-August right after spending two days at the outstanding no-tipping Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra. The Imperial seemed a high class tourist factory by comparison. We can't blame the hotel for their well-heeled but rude guests, but an extended family occupied the room next to ours and left the door open, making the hall an extension of their room for the convenience of their effusively happy guests and well-wishers. The false colonial atmosphere is thin when reality sets in. You'll be sure to experience the costumed doorman's pregnant 90-second car door close for those slow to tip and the ever-helpful bathroom sink faucet turner-oner and towel-hander. The grand hotel show would be charming if the staff were faultless, but there were all-too-human lapses that were never seen at the Oberoi. There was only one bottle of water in the room when we checked in. One staff promised to phone us with information and never did. Another got our order for the boutique wrong. I asked the telephone operator to connect me to Thai International Airways city ticket office (and I told her the name of the building). When she checked and called back, I asked her what was the correct number and she didn't tell me. Instead she connected me to the Thai International airport office, and they kindly told me the number of the city office (of course, I was charged for the call to the airport). A card in the room proudly offers special pillows, but of two kinds that we requested, only one could be located during our 2-day stay. The buffet breakfast is spectacular, and the food in the restaurants is excellent, though not as good a value as Amarvilasi in Agra, Before we checked out, we called for a porter to get our two large suitcases. After 10 minutes, we wheeled them to the lobby ourselves where a porter ran the last four steps to take them from us. Other things, including Internet, did work well, and we can see why others were ecstatic with the Imperial. But we had just come from a hotel with better trained staff and real heart. "
the imperial ,"Nothing else to say other than - PERFECT The Imperial describes itself as &quot;amongst the finest hotels in Asia&quot; and I have no hesitation to say that it is THE finest city hotel in Asia. We stayed for 2 nights in an Art Deco Suite having been upgraded from a Heritage Room. Our rate was $200 per night including tax which was more than reasonable in particular in comparison with other 5* Star hotels in capitals around the globe. The suite was beautifully furnished, spacious and provided an Oasis where we could relax. The service was impeccable throughout the hotel and there was not a single staff member we ran into who did not greet us with a smile. It was quite clear from the beginning that all staff took pride in what they were doing. We ate at the Italien restaurant and were very pleased with the variety of food, the quality and in particular the affordable wine list. On departure we had to order breakfast in room as the restaurant opens at 06:00am which was when had to leave. Breakfast in room is available from 04:30am. We made a note on the breakfast card to deliver it at 05:30am sharp instead of the usual 30 minute window hotels normally grant themselves. And so it was, the door bell rang at exactly 05:30am! All in all, a beautiful hotel which even if you don't stay there is worth the visit as it could also function as an art gallery. "
the imperial ,"Old world charm Old world colonial charm except that me &amp; my wife preffered the ultra efficient service &amp; the great sleep we had at the nearby Shangri La .Back fromJaipur, ITC Maurya was another let down. "
the imperial ,Saved by the Imperial Our stay at the Imperial came at the end of an exhausting time in India. We arrived at 7.00 in the morning our room wasnt ready - so they made another available for our immediate use. We were on our honey moon and the kitchen provided a scrumptious chocolate cake. The rooms were lovely. The suite was sumptious and luxurious. We ate at two restaurants superb food and service - The Imperial and the service makes Delhi memorable in lovely ways. Recommend the Imperial every time - people and management and experience - wonderful. 
the imperial ,"Enjoyed The Imperial We were booked into The Imperial by the small agency handling our independent itinerary in both Winter, 2004 and Winter, 2005. We loved the location, the helpful, smiling staff, the heritage, the gleaming facility and the sumptuous breakfast buffet. Our room wasn't on a &quot;Princess Diana&quot; level, but it had everything we wanted. We're definitely not royals, but felt like it--the way we were treated there. The desk always changed our Rupee notes for smaller denominations without a hassle. An added plus is being able to walk outside past the gate and right onto Janpath Road where the shopping for trinkets is right there waiting for a bargain. We left bags stuffed with our Janpath &quot;treasures&quot; in the left luggage (when we departed for the desert) until our last night in India when we returned to The Imperial several weeks later--very handy. Would we stay at The Imperial again? Yes! We're returning mid-October this year. We know it's not the fanciest in town, but we were totally pleased. "
the imperial ,"Top property - beautiful artwork and tasty restaurants So happy that I decided to try the Imperial instead of one of the big International brands in town. .. Had a great 4 night business stay in mid May heat wave. Started out well before my arrival when helpful staff at the Concierge/travel desk advised me on how to spend my one day off, arranged train tickets to Agra, and my airport pickup. Food service manager booked my Saturday night reservation at well regarded, Spice Route. Airport pickup was seamless - a spotless Rangerover (or Landcrusier or some luxe SUV!) with driver and hotel rep, ice cold water, and cool towels. We stopped to rescue a fellow guest whose hotel car had been involved in a fender bender but made the easy drive to the hotel in less than 20 minutes. Check in was fine - though not especially warm. Common areas are dramatic and beautiful and every inch of the hotel has fabulous Colonial-era artwork displayed. There are pretty fountains and statues and several attractive restaurants. The pool area is attractive though nothing spectacular. Beverage service there was efficient and friendly. The website promised Spa does not exist yet (date TBA) though I was told that there was a small beauty parlor and that room massage was available.... Food and service were solid at all outlets, though the bar servers at the 1911 were a little harried one night and left everyone waiting 15+ minutes for a drink. Dinner at the Italian spot was great - Basil sorbet was a fab dessert choice. Spice Route was very good. Club sandwich and such was very well done at the 1911. Thali-style lunch at Daniel's was really special. And the all-Bruschetta menu in the terrace courtyard was an interesting option for a light snack. Phew! On to the room: I was given a smoking room instead of my requested NS room, but it had enough charm (and no stale smoke smell) that I didn't bother to change. The king bedded room was spacious with tasteful furnishings, flat screen TV, well-designed storage, and an immaculate bath. My view was over the internal courtyard - which was fine for me. I paid a very low $149/night. Business Center was very efficient and professional though I thought prices were high - even by an International standard (as I recall 250 INR per page for a fax - apx US$5.50!)... Location is good - short walk along Janpath shopping arcade to Connaught Place or easy taxi access to anywhere. The addition of a spa will be a great ammenity as travel in India can be overwhelming because of the beauty and sadness. I will stay here again. "
the imperial ,"The Delhi Classic Outstanding experience from start to finish. Airport transfer in brand new limousine with responsible driver (and that's something in India!), 2-minute check-in, elegant rooms oozing colonial splendour. Ate in the Spice Route restaurant. Generous portions, fine cooking and friendly staff. I've been coming back to this hotel time and again as it provides a welcome relief from the usual 5-star clones that all look and feel the same. The Imperial has character! "
the imperial ,"This Hotel is Fabulous My Mum and I stayed her as part of our &quot;big&quot; india trip Dec / Jan 2006.It is without a doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in (and I've stayed in some fab ones). Ignore the earlier reviews. The staff are very friendly - take the time to chat to them, we had some great chats with the guys in the bar about India in general and cricket in particular. We wanted to visit one of the restaurants with the beautiful decor when it wasn't open and the restaurant manager took the time to show us personally... The food excellent, the surroundings gorgeous (and we stayed when they were building the spa - I'm sure its even better now. The hotel itself is full of museum pieces and you can even do a tour of the artefacts if you wish.I can't recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be staying there on my next trip to India. "
the imperial ,"Nice hotel! We stayed here 1 night during our &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; trip and LOVED it! The room was quite large and came with some nice extras like cookies, slippers, bathrobes, etc. The bathroom was also very modern, clean, and nice - compared to other hotel bathrooms even in the U.S. It definitely was a hotel of luxury with history. I enjoyed walking around and looking at all of the artwork. The restaurants were nicely decorated and had good food. The bartenders made good drinks. We wished we could have stayed here longer. "
the imperial ,"very very good The several reviews before mine are in no way accurate reagarding this magnificent hotel.I would not be surprised if they were written by competing hotels.The Imperial is by far the best hotel in Dehli.Although the oberoi prperties in rajasthan are some of the best in the world the one in Dehli does not even come close to the magnificent Imperial hotel.Great rooms,fantastic staff and service.Dehli itself is a dirty chaotic city that is a poor introduction to a magic country--dont get disheartened it gets better.The Imperial provides a great oasis of calm.Beautifully restored by its sikh owners who have committed their staff to the highest levels of service.When In Dehli stay at the Imperial.The much touted connaught place is not so great and the government cottage emporium shop much touted by guidebooks down the street is a joke.You can buy the same goods in the usa and europe at half the price.Shoppping in Rajasthan is much better.. "
the imperial ,"Average experience I spent 2 nights Feb 20 &amp; 21 at the Imperial in New Delhi after spending 3 nights at the Oberio. Here's my take: The bad--My room was probably the worst in the hotel. The linens were soiled and the room was extremely noisy. We asked to switch rooms within 2 hours and never heard back from the reception. Upon asking again, same story. Now for the good- great locating near Connaught Place and very impressive lobby and great restaurants. We dined at the Spice room 2 times and 1911 twice as well. Food was great and they disounted the food bill 50% for using American Express. Overall, my experience was average to poor. The Oberoi's rooms were much, much nicer and the service was better. "
the imperial ,"Don't stay there. Go for afternoon tea. The Imperial was originally an art deco hotel, built by Luytens as a sign of the new India. Today it is an anachronism, It is like an overdressed dowager still waiting for a 1920's tea dance to begin. The problem is that in 2006 the dowager is definately dotty and has some very strange ideas about how the world works.Very little of todays booming and optimistic India can be sensed in a hotel where the waiters wear rather grubby regimental uniforms, which might give the tourists a pretty patronising picture but miss the point.The rooms vary widely within a category. A heritage room can mean many things. The showers are wonderful, although the lack of a seperate conditioner, just shampoo/conditioner combined, was annoying.However, clearly at this price the place is more than comfortable but special it is not. My advice is go for afternoon tea have a look but stay elsewhere.The best thing about The Imperial was the staff member who knew how to humourously exploit the over the top nature of the place. The worst thing, the need to hassle for a good room upon arrival and the tip hungry staff.At the Imperial, I felt like I was on a conveyor belt for well heeled tourists. If you want luxury in India, the Oberoi's are the best. "
the imperial ,"Top notch though impersonal We stayed at the Imperial in January 2006. It was perfectly nice and we were happy we'd arranged a pickup from the airport. Our room looked out on to the garden and was spacious and comfortable. It was a little disappointing that the pool was closed and also the restaurants were fully booked, being New Year. The hotel is beautiful and a museum in itself. My only complaint was that the service was quite impersonal - we'd just come from the Ritz in Singapore and it didn't have the same level of attentiveness or interest. However it is a landmark and is worth the visit. "
the imperial ,"Overpriced pantomine in need of a cleaner The category “heritage room” covers a multitude of sins – and some (few) rather nice rooms which may be had in exchange for a demonstration of stubborn recalcitrance and insistence in the face of an impassive explanation that there is some variation in the quality of “heritage” rooms. Only too true.The staff fawn uniformly and services varies between fair to average and not home at all. All expect the requisite tip in every interaction, with payment now and service in &quot;maybe&quot; an hour or so. Information provided is often accurate – but rather misleading in its omissions. For example: “Yes madam; the swimming pool is just round there” does rather make one expect to find a functional swimming pool with water rather than a boarded up construction site with no water.Once you disregard the scruffiness and enter the pantomime it is quite fun – but not worth the price. At half the price it would be fine.Alternatively skip the pantomime and check into the Shangri-la – real 5 star value for money with elegance and position (and just around the corner). "
the imperial ,"Being Served... This hotel is a cut above the rest, if you can stomach having ten people serving you at all times. The entire establishment really is a throwback to colonial times- from the architecture to the distinct feeling of priviledge. That said, the rooms are huge with some ammenities I have never seen elsewhere (lint rollers for example), and the location is great. Any desire you might have will be attended to. I am a tour creator and had a group stay here and every single participant loved The Imperial. They raved about it for days! Be forewarned that internet access at the business center is outrageously priced, as are most menu items. Auto rickshaws are not allowed onto the hotel premises, but if you step outside the compund they are readily available and a great way to get around if you are in a real hurry. One last thing- the pool is currently closed- you cannot even peak at it- and the gardens are pretty much non-exsistant due to a spa construction. "
the imperial ,"Difficult staff and a lesson in fighting for what you want I stayed at the Imperial in January 2006 and did not share the enthusiasm of previous reviewers. While the lobby and corridors are stunning, I found this to be the only positive feedback on my stay as a whole. The restaurants are very pricey, the service at the hotel is abysmal, the rooms are very cold in January, the swimming pool is closed, and breakfast is opulent but the food is dull and uninteresting. Problems with service: faulty communication between travel agent and reception desk, 2 hours to retrieve a sweater from lost and found, 1 hour average response for extra blankets.We used a travel agent and got very so so rooms on ground floor next to the service area (therefore a non stop flow of staff and noise in front of your door). At my second stay, I refused such a room and was told the hotel was entirely booked but, when I insisted, I was shown a nice quiet room on the 1st floor.While hotels in India can be a challenge, the Imperial requires an amount of stubbornness unsurpassed in my travels. If you want to stay there, make sure you know what you get in terms of rooms and are prepared to fight for it. "
the imperial ,"This is one of the great hotels of the world The Imperial is a Delhi institution, but not one that is riding on its past laurels. It's great - it embraces you as you come in dirty and hot, and soothes your aches away. This is an immaculate hotel, which draws on the imperial past, but doesn't glorify it. The architecture has strong art-deco influences, gardens and pool are very nice. The bar will pull you in many times - it's very old, with perfectly trained bar staff.Make sure you get a room with an outside view - the atrium facing rooms are a little bit gloomy during the day. "
the imperial ,"Overpriced When we arrived to our room at the Imperial around 11 pm after a very long travel day we thought our very expensive heritage room was just ok but we were too tired to do anything about it. But that night, the heat did not work (and it was cold) and the toilet would intermittently not stop running water. The next morning when I pulled back the curtains, I saw that we were looking down upon an ugly construction site. We had paid top dollar for the supposed luxury of this hotel and the &quot;extras&quot; of a heritage room. When I complained at the front desk they seemed disinterested but finally someone agreed that if we would pack our bags they would move us to a nicer room with a nicer view before we came back at the end of our tour day. Well we got back and nothing had happened then we were told that the hotel was full and there were no rooms. After much complaining and consistent disinterest from the hotel staff they showed me 2 different rooms at around 6:30 and 7:30 pm both of which weren't any nicer than the one we had and neither of which had a view. At this point I was just too tired to move and gave up since the toilet seemed to be working properly now and we were leaving the next day. They never took responsibility and kept saying that I had not booked a room with a view. Of course, my issue was not so much that I did not get a great view, but that the rooms themselves were not up to my expectations for the $360 we were paying and at any other hotel your room would be discounted if you had a ugly construction out the window. They really never offered an apology and were unresponsive to my complaints. Now I must say that all of the public spaces and restaurants are truly beautiful in every way and that we got good service at both the Spice Route and 1911 restaurants once we actually got the attention of a waiter. I peaked in some other rooms while wandering the halls and noted they did have nicer rooms. So I think the quality is very inconsistent and the price value ratio at this place is way off . Don't know what other hotel options exist but I would only stay here if you get a much better price and can somehow demand one of the updated rooms. "
the imperial ,"fantastic fantastic Worth every penny . . . . . a must for a couple of days of luxury . . the best in Delhi . . we paid about £200 per night . . after travelling for 3 weeks, we'd had enough of basic hotels and this was bliss "
the imperial ,"Expensive and unimpressive rooms Checked into our heritage room on 27th December which was dark dingy with dirty rug. We asked to be moved and were told hotel was full. Asked again later and was shown a room on the outside of hotel which was better but very noisy with traffic noise outside.Main hotel restaurant and breakfast, the service was slow and miserableSpice route restaurant, fantastic decor but food extremely expensive and have had better.Drink prices were way overpriced. "
the imperial ,"One of the world's top hotels Simple one of the best hotels in the world. Sophisticated and elegant, the hotel and its interiors are works of art in and of themselves. "
the imperial ,This must be the best hotel in India We stayed at The imperial in December '05.This is a top class traditional hotel.The building and the interior is truly superb. The staff are professional and helpful. It's not cheap but you will have to look very hard to find any fault.If you are visiting for the first time I would strongly reccommend this hotel. Beware a cheap hotel in Delhi may be a total shock to your system! 
the imperial ,Though The Imperial was Great! The Imperial was the first hotel in which we stayed in India and was unsurpassed by any other. The hotel has a lot of character - the corridors and restaurants are repleat with 19th century printings and etchings. It was also spotlessly clean and the hotel staff were polite and helpful at all times. The hotel is a true haven from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding city. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and also ate dinner one night in The Spice Route and the other night in the 1911 Restaurant. The food was delicious in both. We whole heartedly recommend this hotel. 
the imperial ,"Elegant The wide, well lit corridors of this hotel have interesting high quality paintings of India on the walls. Rooms are spacious. WiFi okay but not great. Service excellent. Probably the best place to stay in a depressing city. The Delhi airport is frequently fog-bound in Dec and Jan. Huge delays in a sub-standard airport. "
the imperial ,"Looks good ... The Imperial looks very nice indeed. Our room was nicely furnished and was spotlessly clean. However, we did have some problems with the service at the hotel. There was a blockage in the drain of the shower which we reported on our arrival. If anyone did come to investigate then we were not aware of it since the problem persisted throughout our stay. Also be careful to check that you are billed correctly for any treatments in the barber/beauticians. We also found that staff couldn't really cope with a sudden rush of people coming down for breakfast. We had to wait for a table and then waited some considerable time for the toast and tea we ordered (my fried egg never did materialise ...). Hope this doesn't sound too down on this lovely hotel, but little things matter when you are in this price range. "
the imperial ,"Loved this hotel We were lucky to have two stays at this hotel at the begining &amp; end of our holiday.I loved this hotel a tranquil oasis set back from the hustle &amp; bustle of Delhi, we could easily stayed here for a month.We were booked into Heritage rooms on both our stays, wonderfully clean, fresh &amp; spacious.Believe you me the Imperial serves the best breakfast in India. Wonderful fresh squeezed fruit juices, good selection cereals, fresh fruit with yoghurt &amp; home made pastries to finish off.We were unfortunate not to be able to eat in the spice route restaurant as it was booked up with conferences. We tried the italian San Gimignano &amp; the 1911, both of these restaurants passed our expectations. The good thing about the Imperial hotel is that they do not add chilie powder to every meal unlike others in India.My wife &amp; I have stayed at Raffles hotel &amp; for me The Imperial comes a close second. Thank you Imperial I will recommend you to anyone visiting Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Colonial spleandour at its best!!! Just returned from a trip to New Delhi and this hotel is simply fantastic.I checked in and out of this hotel twice and had fantastic rooms on both occasions. The service and staff were very helpful and nothing was too much of a problem to them. The general decor of the hotel is colonial spleandour at its best!! The business centre is always very useful to me for email access etc and the wi-fi connectivity they have at the Imperial is excellent. Overall I have no complaints, will be staying there again next time and would strongly recommend this hotel to any visitors to Delhi. "
the imperial ,"Indulge your British Colonial fantasies Like most of the reviewers, we had a great experience at the Imperial. Yes, it is costly, but for the service, location, art and decor it was worth the indulgence. We arrived via plane in the middle of the night, and Imperial staff were there for pickup. Beds/pillows are comfortable. Noise was not a problem. Complimentary breakfast(cereals, yogurt, fruit, pastries, juice, eggs) was available and was fine. As other reviewers noted, the Imperial also houses a restaurant touted by Conde Nast as one of the top ten restaurants in Asia. While the decor and presentation were great, the quality of food was no better than a good Thai/ SE Asian restaurant in the US or UK. The other restaurants served good, if pricey, food. "
the imperial ,"Fantastic and doesn't have to cost a mint! This is easily the best hotel we've ever stayed at. The reviews say it all - perfect service, gorgeous surroundings, fantastic food. But, know that it doesn't have to cost a huge fortune! We got a $249 rate and while our room was smallish, it was on the beautiful first floor, a short walk to the lobby and restaurants and near the business center where you can email and fax to your heart's content. And I would recommend the 1st floor, if you can get it, higher up the hallways get shabbier - per my walkabout one day to admire the artwork. And the FURNITURE! If you are an antique buff at all, make a whole hotel wander part of your itinerary, especially the long main central hallways on each floor. You will be well rewarded. Also be sure to enjoy the breakfast - silver service galore - and the Spice Route restaurant. Contrary to some reviews, our meal there was superb, and the decor is not to be missed. Our only complaint was noise. We were on the end, and the walls do not block out the road noise, nor the sounds of the wedding party outside. The pool suffers from the same road noise problem, and they are doing some kind of renovation out back, so a large part of the rear gardens are torn up and blocked off. But for the rate we paid, we were still thrilled - we plan to return on our next trip. "
the imperial ,"Perfect! The Imperial is a wonderfuly restored old Colonial hotel. Great location. Terrific rooms. Helpful, attentive staff. Great breakfasts!We had a very large room - maybe a junior suite. Very tall ceilings - peaceful, elegant. Great amenities. You can walk to some great markets and the Government Handicraft store is nearby. The grounds are beautiful. They serve both Indian and European food at breakfast, and we always had the Indian breakfast including the fresh lassi and fresh squeezed juices. Very clean. We would never stay in Delhi without staying in the Imperial. "
the imperial ,"One of the best I stayed here recently for 2 nights with my wife after our wedding. The hotel looks amazing and the rooms are excellent. With its wide marble corridors and the staff in their uniforms it makes for an excellent setting. The rooms are excellent in their size and furnishings and we found the service from the staff to be top notch. The real highlight however are the number of paintings in the hotel, it is full of them and we spent some time just wandering the huge halls looking at them. Its nice to find a hotel with something a little different from the bland rooms you often get from the top chains, and the Imperial has real character. After the Imperial we left for Australia and after staying in numerous hotels for our trip both me and my wife felt the Imperial was the best of the lot. Having stayed in some of the other hotels in Delhi we think its the best hotel in Delhi and a pleasure to stay at, indeed its one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at "
the imperial ,"Disappointed at first I had booked a Deluxe suite in advance but on arrival was checked into a Deco suite. As I had an idea what the rooms should look like I knew something wasn't right. I mentioned that I had booked a deluxe suite and the woman checking me in said that it was indeed a Deco suite and it was just as good as the one I had booked. I started to make a fuss so she called the assistant room manager who explained to me that all the deluxe suites were being refurbished, I doubted this as on the website it states that all work has taken place and how come I was able to book it in the first place ? but there was some building work going on so this may have been true .As I didn't like the Deco suite I settled for a Heritage suite but had to haggle the price down as they wanted me to pay the same as I would have for a deluxe suite. It is a Very nice hotel but like a few places I've stayed at in India they need to sort out their reservations system. It is a fantastic place to stay and I would say one of the best hotels I have been to. "
the imperial ,"Disappointed As per the previous reviewer we had problems with the Imperial. We had a confirmed booking, made over 4 months before arrival. They met us at the train station and took us to the hotel without any real problems. Firstimpressions were great. However on checking in they advised that the room was not quite ready and would we wait. About 10 minutes later the duty manager came to advise that a large government delegation had not left, they couldn't be found, and I'm sorry but we have no rooms. After asking for the general manager he finally came and gave us the same story. He did however offer to provide us with a car and driver and to dine in the hotel at their expense. A nice gesture, but as we had wanted to stay in the hotel, not quite the result we wanted. We ended up calling the concierge at the Oberoi (we had just finished a 12 day trip in their magnificent hotels across India) and he found us a room at the Oberoi. (Check out my report on this hotel).The Imperial still supposedly couldn't find us a room the next day, but again sent a car for our use and again offered diner at their &quot;top ten&quot; restaurant the Spice market. Don't know why it's so special. The food was OK but not so greatl as to get a top 10. (The Spice Market in the Bangkok Regent now the 4 Seasons, is much better.) None the less, the hotel is an architectural masterpiece. Very old world, and in the British Raj style. Recently renovated superbly. Gardens not what I expected tho. Designed by the great British architect Edward Luytens (famous for his garden seat). Worth visiting if in Delhi. But as Jerry Seinfeld puts it, &quot;you know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep it&quot;.The Oberoi on the other hand, knows how to really look after you. "
the imperial ,"Be Prepared... Generally a nice hotel, but I left feeling cheated and lied to - I generally felt like a walking wallet, and although I tipped generously and often, it often felt like it was way too much work to get anything accomplished. The staff were constantly smiling but seemed consistently confused. Isn't it a common request to be received at the airport? We signed up for the best room available, and weren't given what we were promised. We eventually were able to switch rooms at a significant premium.The food was not very good. The breakfast buffet is mostly mass produced doughnuts, muffins, etc. as well as bland fruit.We also ate at the restaurant downstairs, touted as &quot;One of the top ten restaurants in the world by Conde Nast.&quot; Avoid the restaurant if possible, we were seated next to a very noisy large group and after struggling through our appetizers we were moved after puzzled and annoyed looks from the waitress. The food was very mediocre; it was good, but definitely not worthy of their &quot;Top Ten&quot; claim. Similar to what we expect from our local Thai take out restaurant. Only ten times as costly. The price of typical restaurant food in India is much lower than comparable meals in the US, so the prices here were exorbitant. It cost around 100USD for dinner for two.The pool is very small for a hotel, and got quite crowded at the times we used it. Also around dusk the pool gets bombarded with a swarm of flying bats that skim a few inches above the water's surface. We were never actually hit or attacked but it was extremely unnerving.In general the grounds were nice, although much smaller than anticipated after reading about the &quot;sprawling gardens&quot; etc. The grounds consist of about 100 feet of grass surrounding the hotel before it meets the busy street.Be careful with the minibar, they give you a small bottle of water on arrival, and the rest you have to pay for at 3 dollars apiece. This could add up quickly since the tap water is not potable.I haven't experienced other hotels in Delhi, so it's possible that they are worse, but I would not return to the Imperial. "
the imperial ,"The only place to stay in Delhi I've stayed here four times now and I would never stay anywhere else in Delhi. It's possibly my favourite hotel in the world - luxurious without losing its 1931 character. The Spice Route restaurant is a must, as is touring the wide marble corridors to see the original early 19th century watercolours and art deco sculptures. If you need a great sleep on soft pillows and a huge dose of unbridled luxury after touring India, stay here - you won't want to step outside. "
the imperial ,"Highly rated hotel One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Almost exceeded Raffles in Singapore, that's saying something. Rooms not quite as booked on check in so got upgraded to a suite. We were only there two nights, wished it had been longer. The rate included meeting at airport, go for this it really smoothes the path - the hotel rep and drivers were very professional and got us to the hotel in quick time in the rush hour. Excellent reception from the fabulous doormen (and lovely women). Particularly striking was the wonderful fragrance that met you as you entered the hotel. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and welcoming. Attention to detail superb. You could spend a week roaming the corridors gazing at the superb artwork, furniture and so on. The IT/business staff were superb, got me online with my sad old laptop in no time courtesy of a loaned wireless thingy.Breakfast buffet OK, but the restaurants at night are excellent. Try the Spice Route, great food but the room is just out of this world. For really great food go to the 1911 for drinks in the bar (best Bloody Mary ever, I had to have another just to be really sure!) and then on to the restaurant for superb Provence style French food. Whatever you do have the Chocolate Souffle - total indulgence and one of the best I've had, including all over France. Room service (for the kids) was among the swiftest I've ever had. The pool area is good, and the grounds are beautiful. Just up the road is a McDonalds, but don't go there for a meat fix as of course there is no beef. Also opposite is Central Cottage Industries Emporium (dont believe the hustlers who tell you its closed and try and get you in their taxi to take you to another store). Here you can buy all manner of carvings, ornaments and clothes at good prices without the hassle of haggling over price. I could do with that place at Christmas!There isn't a downside to this hotel I can think of, except having to leave it. When I pass through Delhi again I wouldn't even look at another hotel. "
the imperial ,"Wonderfull!!! Wonderful hotel and marvellously placed. Ideal environment of the colonial epoch, everything is impeccable in this hotel from its commodes rooms up to the magnificent restaurants (The Spice Route is incredible) and bars (it is an oasis inside the city). I adore it. "

the lalit new delhi ,"Love the Lobby the hotel is gr8 after renovation, need to gear up for the service standards............... "
the lalit new delhi ,"Very comfortable I stayed in Lalit during my brief weekend trip to Delhi. I was positively surprised. Rooms were spacious and decorated with good taste, service was discreet and not too much. Suited well a Scandinavian traveller. "
the lalit new delhi ,"We had a great stay here... Not a bad stay. Location is ok, not exactly in the middle of things, but it's fine. We had a room on the 22nd floor overlooking the city which was nice. Our only complaint is that the reservation wasn't ready when we got there and we had to wait for them to input in the computer again.Otherwise, the rooms were clean, the food service was excellent and we had a great view. The breakfast was good and had no real complaints. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Terrible experience I dont know where to start,it was a bad experience beginning with reservation till check out.I made reservation for two rooms and when I called they told me suite is 19000 per night.I said I would call later to confirm.Called 2 hours later and now they quote rate of 28,000 for same room.Asked that person to talk to manager and they agreed to give rate of 19000 per night.I gave them my credit card number and reservation was made.Then called them later to book another room they could not find my reservation adn had to rebook the room.This is terrible standard for 5 star reservations.Then food taste over there is terrible.We had a function and had 10 things on menu .Out of 10 prespeciifed things there were only 8 of them and all of them tasted terrible.Then come to check out process,the staff has such an attitude - even the person who comes and get your luggage.We conveyed all these things to hotel manager at the end.He made some concessions for our bad experiences.But overall it was terrible stay,there are many 5 star hotels in same area with much better service. "
the lalit new delhi ,"hotel is gorgeous but service lashit I stayed here for four nights in November 2009, and am so disappointed that despite the facelift since last year, the service is still the same: slow, unfriendly and depressing. There is a real problem in this hotel with the staff and customer service compared to any other 5 star hotel. The Taj puts the Lalit to shame, mind you so would the travel lodge. Let's start with the pick up service at the airport. It was complimentary. Great. He nearly went without me though! Two names on the same board. Because it had been booked by the same tour company, the driver assumed that when the first person arrived, they could go without me.. It was the other lady who saved the day by asking the driver to wait behind for me, otherwise they would have gone. Thanks to this lady! Secondly, on check in. 45 minutes this process took. I had requested a &quot;quiet, non-smoking room&quot; and called that day to confirm this request. They didn't have it!! Eventually after much negotiation they had a room, but when I got there, it was facing the train station, and had no bath. So I called up, and they showed me two other rooms with another compromise: one was smoking, one was adjoining room. I went with the &quot;quiet adjoining&quot; - my god bad choice. The hotel might have been refurbished, but the soundproofing at this place is dire. The next door neighbours could be heard rustling their newspapers and stirring their coffee - no joke! It was awful. Also, they decided to start smoking in a non-smoking room as the smoke smell went right under the door and stank my room out. I called front desk to report this, but who knows if they done anything! Laundry service is late. My trousers were 1.5 hours late. Breakfast was nice but again bad service, I was made to sit down at a dirty table, no one cleaned it. Upon check out, they had preauthorised the charges to another guest's credit card, and no one asked me how was my stay. They dont have questionnaires in the room and its no wonder, they know about the hotel's problems I am sure they must get lots of complaints. PS rooms are nice but not functional. Trying to figure out the shower, the button is hidden behind the dial. I wont stay here on my next trip to India. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Pricey but Beautiful I stayed in a new room at The Lalit and thought it was amazing. The service, food, salon, gym, pool, decor, etc. can only be considered five-star, but it definitely came at a high price. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Cordial comfort and convenience The impressive entrance and reception area makes an immediate impact. There are several very comfortable seating areas where you can wait for people, or just watch the world go by. It is a busy hotel, and I suspect that quite a few business people use it as it is close to the business area of Delhi. We liked the position of the hotel ( it is about 10 minutes away from Connaught Place), and the larger than average rooms. We asked for a non-smoking room as close to the top of the hotel as possible, and we weren't disappointed with the fabulous view. The air conditioning worked well and was easy to control. The bed was extra king size, incredibly comfortable with a light duvet. I would have appreciated a sheet under the duvet - sometimes you don't want to sleep with a duvet, but you still need a light cover. Both the bed linen and towels were top quality. We had to ask for extra towels, and one light in the bathroom wasn't working, but it was sorted out pretty quickly once we called reception. The flat screen TV showed all the usual channels, including BBC 24. As I am not a breakfast person I really appreciated the tea making facilities in the room, and also the amount of (free) bottled water. The bathroom was spacious, with a huge walk in shower. Curiously, the bathroom was separated from the main room by a see through glass wall - but you could roll down the fitted blinds if you wanted some privacy. The restaurant on the ground floor is open 24 hours - and we were grateful to be able to order food and something to drink when we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 in the morning. I didn't like having to pay to use the internet in the business centre (if you had your own laptop the wifi was free). But I did like the fact that we were given a late check out and so could take our time before leaving for a late flight out. The pool area was good, hardly used it seemed to us (but we were there in the low season) and the changing room facilities were fine, although the ladies changing rooms could have been better stocked with shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. The service in the restaurant was a bit hit and miss - sometimes very quick, other times we had to wait for ages. Security at the entrance of the hotel was good - fast but thorough. "
the lalit new delhi ,"I would live here all the time if I could! I stayed in the Lalit for a week in September, and am planning to go back there again for a couple of days next week. I travel to- and around- India a lot with my work, and the Lalit is by far the best hotel that i have stayed in in Delhi, and also in India (even better than the Taj Bengal, Hyatt etc). There were a few issues during my stay, but the hotel manager went out of his way to resolve these for me, going over and above what I would expect. The rooms are spacious, modern and a joy to work in, as was the gym. Ah! The gym, the pool and the spa.. I would be happy just living here, in fact. The gym has powerplates, all the latest equipment, a great view, and the staff are extremely helpful. food = great, and a wide selection for room service. Definitely go for the buffet breakfast if you can. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Excellent Hotel-Good location.Value for money. We enjoyed our stay in the Hotel.Centre of Delhi,Cannaugt place ,was walking distance from Hotel.My daughter enjoyed the pool.The room was big with all modern amenities.The breakfast was lavish.All the staff we interacted with were very courteous.Overall an exceiient Hotel. "
the lalit new delhi ,"SNOTTY RECEPTION STAFF The attitude displayed by the reception staff towards me was appalling. I had been looking forward to experiencing this hotel but because I choose not to have a credit card on my person (I have a debit card instead), the reception staff forced me to leave all my cash (Rs5000) with them as a deposit:: I felt quite insulted . In the rest of my travels in throughout India staying at other 5-star hotels, I never once experienced this problem again. The room was modern but the bathroom lighting didn't work. The food was adequate. "
the lalit new delhi ,"The Lalit 5 star. Service was excellent, arrived at 1 :00 am and my credit card was refused but they still let me go to the room.The room was modern with really good fittings, superb bathroom.Reasonably well located, a short taxi or tuk tuk ride to Connaught Place and many other attractions. The restraunt for breakfast was great, the outside eating area was clen and welcoming if a bit noisy from road traffic.All in all a good quality 5 star hotel with attentive and helpful staff. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Lalit Very Comfortable, big rooms, beautiful lights and entertainment...helpful friendly stuff. Everything was Excellent ! "
the lalit new delhi ,"NOT THE BEST - BE SURE TO REQUEST A NEW ROOM AND DONT EAT THE FOOD I stayed at the Lalit in Oct 09. On arrival check in was quick and i was asked if i had stayed with them before. IF you are asked this question say YES otherwise the will give you one of the older rooms yet to be refurbished. I moved rooms as not only was it old, dated and noisy dues to the nearby train station and the constant train horns but the wireless internet is so slow you cannot even access email.The new rooms are very comfortable and modern and the wired internet is fine. Still noisy depending on what side of the hotel you are on. I ate in the hotel each night and mostly the food was fine. The Grill is expensive and service is VERY slow but the food was acceptable. The Chinese resturant is OK. The bistro in the lobby is expensive and the buffet curry's are nothing special. They do however carry a mild case of Salmonella which is an unpleasant way to finish a trip!Check your bill carefully. I booked a room with free internet and they tried to charge me twice. Also check the dates on cans from the mini bar. In both my rooms they were over a year out of date.Over all and acceptable hotel with good fitness facilities and good location. If you can get over the noise of the trains and don't get poisoned its fine. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Make sure you request a new room I arrived with a colleague and we checked in together. Her room was amazing, modern, and clearly worth the 5 star rating. Mine was old fashioned, had a bathroom with old fittings and rust stains, and smelled of stale smoke (room 1512). When I asked to change room due to the smell they told me the hotel was fully booked and they would move me in the morning but in the meantime would arrange for my room to be aired. Nothing happens quickly in this hotel but 45 min later a man finally turned up to help. Eventually we agreed there was nothing that could make the room smell better so I was moved to a room which miraculously became available.Overall the hotel fixtures and fittings were nice but, while staff were keen to meet every need, it could take hours (and several reminders) for them to actually do anything. The breakfast and other food was ok but nothing special and on one day we sat for half an hour at a table where we'd had to clear dirty dishes to one end (there were no clean ones available) and did not manage to see a single waiter to ask for a coffee. "
the lalit new delhi ,Good 5-star hotel with a classy touch Hotel must have been renovated recently. They kept some of the &quot;old&quot; features but at the same time put it up to international 5-star standards. Well done. 
the lalit new delhi ,"would not stay again... We only had one night in the Lalit, and chose it because it was closer to the railway as we were travelling, by train, to Agra the next day. Our flight from Varanasi was delayed..so we did not arrive at the hotel until 7 30 pm. Our booked room was not ready...and we had to wait!!! The girl typed and typed and typed into her computer..no apologies no reason and so annoying!! When we finally made it to the room..the room was clean and fresh. There was a sign to request fresh fruit if required. As our next morning was to be really early..I thought...good idea. Tried to ring in house dining. Phone didn't work. Went down stairs and requested at the front desk. You guessed it...never arrived. We had a drink in the downstairs bar and ate in the restaurant. All fine, not exceptional and definitely zero warm and fuzzy customer service, and quite expensive. To be fair in one way, the Lalit were finalising what looked like a massive renoavation BUT their prices definitely do not reflect any leeway for that...so they need to be judged against the full price tarriff. Would not stay again. Would head back to the Taj "
the lalit new delhi ,"Comfortable if somewhat characterless The Lalit is extremely comfortable, well appointed and well run. The location is handy for Connaught Place. Our standard room was spacious, clean and comfortable. In fact, everything you would expect from an international class hotel.It suffers only for being a large international hotel, in feeling a little anonymous and impersonal, which is only a minor complaint.If you can secure a reasonable rate via one of the hotel web sites, this is a good place to stay. Watch out for early check-in charges, though. "
the lalit new delhi ,"The worst hotel that I have exeperienced in my 10 travelling years As expatriates for years, we have travelled to many countries and lived in various hotels for business or leisure purposes. Here is a summary of our 3 days stayed at this hotel. Upon our arrival, we discovered that our confirmed reservation was not listed in the hotel. We understand sometimes things are not in pleasant way and thus be patience for the front office staff to check. Sadly, the staff took ages to check our booking and promised to come back to us after his investigation. To our utterly dismay and shock, the staff didn't check with the booking agent and thus created another havoc during our check out. We believe, an unprofessional behaviour indeed does not reflect positively on a 5 star rating hotel. Space is limited, and we can't continue with more words. You are more than welcome to contact us for more details. "
the lalit new delhi ,"A diamond in the rough The Lalit remains one of the most lavish hotels in which I have every stayed. Everything in the hotel is modern, stylish and sparkling clean. There is a small night club/bar inside the hotel as well as a restaurant. Make sure to try the breakfast buffet, it is awesome! "
the lalit new delhi ,"Pretty Decent and a Good value Lalit is within walking distance of Connaught Place. Very nice rooms, good staff. I liked the gym as very few people used it and it had new equipment. Coffee shop is OK, but breakfast buffet is not as grand as the Taj or Radisson, but still good. Make sure you grab the waiter's attention if you require coffee immediately. For some strange reason, they haven't figured out the caffeine needs of the Western traveler. I really liked their wired internet. High speed, secure and no hassle logging on. Would stay here again. Paid @ $140 a night. "
the lalit new delhi ,Very nice hotel walking distance to Connaught Place Very nice hotel with helpful staff and walking distance to Connaught Place 
the lalit new delhi ,Our home away from home for seven nights We loved this hotel. It was our home for a total of 7 nights during our 3 week trip to India this summer. The security is very impressive. We felt very safe and secure in a city which is pretty crazy at times. A full breakfast was included. We had most meals in the 24/7 resturant located on the first floor. Desk people were beautifully dressed and very helpful. Room service was immediate. They even knew our names. All issues were addressed promptly. The pool area is breathtaking. Lounge chairs rest in the water. Service was very impressive. We all had our hair cut and other services of the spa which were first rate. The shop owners in the hotel were especially nice. We bought sari's and beautiful scarves from Kashmiri Arts located on the second floor. We stayed at many hotel during our stay which were nice but the Lalit is in a class all its own. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Impressive !! Hotel Lalit has beautiful new rooms. Myself and my clients were impressed with the service. Mr Ravindra Kumar, F&amp;B Manager has been very courteous and always make sure that clients go back satisfied and come back to Lalit for their next trip to India. I always impressed with Ravindra. He has been sending regular mails to remind us the interesting events, gala dinners held in The Lalit.. What a great way to be in touch with the clients in various countries..As promised with Ravindra Kumar I recommended my clients to stay for 15 room nights in month of September 2009. Yesterday I got the feedback from the client that service was impressive and Ravindra and other staff of hotel took good care. All my Japanese clients felt like home.. Thank you Lalit and thank you Ravindra.. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Beautiful hotel I stayed at the Lalit with my partner during our recent visit to India. The hotel is impressive with high ceiling and modern furishings. Nice facilities especially the swimming pool and gym is equipped with new and good machines. The room is clean and comfortable. The staff are polite. Many nice restaurants in the hotel, breakfast is good with wide spread of food, I had dinner at Wok however food is not up to expectation should be improved with its presentation and taste. Excellent location just minutes away to the famous bengali market. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Overall satisfactory but some minor problems We stayed three nights at the Lalit. I had a mixed experience with them during our stay. We had some minor issues besides that everything went well. We had booked through a travel agent and got a good rate for the room inclusive of breakfast.The location of this hotel is really good five minutes from railway station and Connaught Place. It was convenient as shopping and loads of restaurants were around the corner. Taxi charged Rs. 50 and auto rickshaw charged Rs. 20 to go to CP. Taxis were available at all times and rickshaw could be hired from outside the hotel.The lobby is breathtaking with a nice waterfall, huge paintings and pianist, everything in the lobby is spanking brand new. Our room was on the 19th floor with a great view but the room was really old and it was especially visible in the bathroom with old taps, rickety shower, watermarks and chips in the wash basin. We had problems with air conditioning making noises and that got fixed and one day cable went off as well but was fixed promptly. These are very minor issues but for a five star should have been fixed beforehand and it makes a difference between a good and great stay.The breakfast was really good; it was buffet style with both Indian and American options. There are tons of different items and baked goods as well. The food was prepared fresh and had several cooking stations.The attitude of the staff was great and were always willing to help with a smile. Wifi is available for Rs 200 for 30 minutes. I signed up for this twice and used it for about 10 minutes each, but upon checkout they billed for Rupees 850 stating that I used the internet for an hour each but could not explain the charges as I had only signed up for the half an hour option. I was not going to argue over $10 as they said have to check with the IT to find out the problem.We were a bit let down with some little issues, these things are not expected of a hotel trying to compete with Taj or Oberoi. Overall we had a satisfactory stay at the Lalit and will probably stay again because of its great location. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Fantastic Hotel On a recent stay I found the Lalit to be a great hotel to stay at in New Delhi. Very modern with a beutiful lobby, great rooms, great restraunts/bar &amp; a lovely pool area. Staff were always very friendly &amp; helpful and the bed was soo comfortable!Pool area very nice with lots of lounges to choose, my only gripe that no alcohol would be served by the pool, so much for my cocktail &amp; a swim! Was about 4 blocks walking distance to shops/market or a few minutes tuk tuk ride for about 40 rupees. Price of food at hotel felt a little over the top for India, though it was beautiful food, the buffet to die for &amp; it should be expected at a 5 star hotel.This hotel deserves it 5 stars, I would stay again, it was a great choice "
the lalit new delhi ,"A more intimate 5 star business hotel Usually stay in The Park or the Imperial but booked into this place for a change. Good gym, small but perfectly formed, with new machines. Bar not too uber trendy or pretentious. Good standard/choice of food on the buffet/a la carte. What I really liked was the feeling that this hotel was not just another huge, anonymous 5 star hotel that you can rattle around in (although it did have approx 500 rooms!). Will definitely use again. "
the lalit new delhi ,Good service good value for Delhi Have stayed at the Lalit three times now.The continued updating of the building is good. The pool and terrace were available on this trip and are very nice. A small oasis of calm in the middle of Delhi. Only downside is the piped music can get on your nerves.Staff are friendly and the service is good. Room service food and restaurant a'la Carte menu is always a joy.When we first stayed there it had the largest range in a breakfast buffet I've ever seen. Unfortunately it seems to be getting smaller and relies more on processed and pre-packed products. This might be a minor point but it was an attraction on earlier visits. It is possibly seasonal.WiFi/Internet price is high. Business centre printing prices are extortionate. 
the lalit new delhi ,Absolutely delightful I really liked the property. Location is excellent and the hotel is 5 star delux i would say. At the bargain i got it was a steal. The rooms are classy and they upgraded me to their superior room on my request at the reception. Further even a late check out was given .Reception was good and very helpful. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Nice Hotel good room This is a nice hotel in the heart of new delhi. I was traveling with my friends. We had a nice rooms.The hotel was helpful with helping us to get information about newdelhi, recommending and booking nice restaurants.But the cups and kettle in the room verey dirty they dont wash it well take care ,,see and wash them good befor you use them.Bathroom verey cute but there is problem in shower basin water is stuck ..Internet verey expensive.. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Excellent place Well the rooms were extremely good,staff nice,the 24x7coffee shop great,choice of breakfast was the best I ever had in india.In short...excellent hotel.. "
the lalit new delhi ,"The Best Hotel I Have Stayed At I initially planned on staying at the Lalit for only a few days in February before moving on to another place, but had such a good experience that I ended up staying here until my trip ended in June.What made my experience memorable was the kind of service that my family and I received. I fell ill on my 2nd or 3rd day and when one of the housekeepers learned of this, he asked if I needed any medical assistance. We told him that I would be fine, and thanked him. Later that evening, I received a phone call from somebody--front desk, I believe--asking how I was feeling. The next morning a manager asked me how I was doing and connected me with a doctor, who prescribed medication for me. Receiving that sort of attention says a lot about their level of service, and it continued after I extended my stay. Everyone from the bottom to the top—from porters, waiters, and housekeeping to upper management--treated us like we were VIPs. As for the hotel, itself...Just as other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is beautiful and decorated in a contemporary style.The standard rooms are comfortable and of a good size. I liked the furniture and decor. The hardwood floors are a nice touch and also function well in keeping the room cool. After a long, hot day, I would love to return to my room and turn on the large flat-panel TV while sitting on the comfy bed. Although there are plenty of dining options outside of the hotel, the 24/7 &quot;coffee shop&quot; located on the lobby level served all our needs and we rarely bothered eating out. It is run very well, and the service was excellent during my stay. The wait staff was attentive and always very friendly and the chefs, themselves, would often drop by to ask how the food was, eager for feedback. The breakfast buffet is very nice--it's possible that the selection may vary depending on whether or not it's tourist season, but regardless they offer both continental and Indian fare. The bakery next to the 24/7 coffee shop is also nice.There are other restaurants in the hotel, and I must say that the Baluchi restaurant is great. The food is good, and 6 days a week there is live music performed at night. I would sometimes just go there to listen to the ghazals before turning in for the night.The fitness center, which is open 24 hours a day is good, and quite exceptional for a hotel--free weights, machines (including a Smith machine), treadmills and bikes as well as a small yoga/stretching room. Next to the fitness center is the spa and the lovely swimming pool, which opened at the beginning of March.The location is excellent. It is not very far from any of the tourist destinations. In fact, we could see two historic landmarks (India Gate and Humayun's Tomb) from our hotel room window. It is within walking distance of the main Connaught Place circus and a few other markets--the main Connaught Place center, as well as the smaller Bengali and Shankar markets. It is also very close to a metro station. All of these are 5-10 minute walks from the hotel, though there are also plenty of auto rickshaws outside the hotel grounds and along the way if you prefer not to walk.Overall, this hotel has a lot going for it. I had a great experience, and although I had never heard of the Lalit hotel chain prior to my visit, I would most certainly wish to stay there again if I return to Delhi. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Beautiful Hotel Exceptional Service Great Food I stayed at the Lalit for a week while in Delhi this past spring and would HIGHLY recommend it to any travelers visiting the city. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff was phenomenal. Overall, it was without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences I've had to date. -StaffThe Lalit's staff is perhaps what sets it apart from other hotels, in that they seem to go above and beyond to be hospitable to the hotel's guests. Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to go out of his/her way to ensure that we were properly taken care of during our stay (especially the wait staff at the 24/7 restaurant downstairs).-RoomsAs far as comfort goes, the Lalit's rooms are what you would expect from any really nice hotel in the US or Europe. What I think set it apart from others was the level of cleanliness (immaculate!) in the room. Also, the room we stayed in was beautifully furnished with modern decor, making it very pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint as well. -LocationThe hotel is located very centrally, in Delhi's Connaught Place district. This was great as we were close to many of the main tourist attractions (Humayun's Tomb, India Gate, etc.), and certainly not far from the others. Given the traffic situation in Delhi, this proved to be very advantageous throughout the trip.-DiningThere are at least two or three restaurants housed in the hotel, however I never ventured beyond its main &quot;24/7 Cafe&quot;, where I ate at least two meals each day. The menu is reasonably-priced and very extensive, offering American, Italian, Japanese, and of course, Indian dishes. Perhaps the best part of the restaurant (aside from the fact that it is open at all hours) was the daily breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of fresh fruits, cheeses, pastries, cereals, eggs/omlettes, and much, much more.-Fitness Center/SpaAlso worth noting is the Lalit's exceptional fitness center, which offers a number of exercise options and wonderful equipment (free weights, weight machines, ellipticals, treadmills). Additionally, they also offer kickboxing classes, as well as yoga. There is also a spa attached, though I did not make use of it.-PoolJust outside the fitness center is a gorgeous outdoor pool, where you can even order food and beverages to snack on while relaxing by the water. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Pleasant...the best beds this side of delhi The best bit about the hotel is that even though its in Connaught Place, its still removed enough from the madness. Its all but 10 minutes of walking to CP inner circle and janpath and similar to the metro station. Ideal for the business traveller as much of the Cp business district is like next door.Also refreshing was the room (though the touch up work was little sketchy at places - leaving much to desire) but the rain head shower, the bath tub, the clear class partition between the room and the washroom...was clam and simple.The minibar left much a lot much to desire, i mean 4 cans of soda and two bottles of water, please gimme sm more. The most comfortable bit about my room 2103 was the beds...the best beds i have slept in the mattress was divine to say the least soft but just the right amount, and the pillows again really nice...i had one of the most comfortable night caps ever in a hotel.I tried just a bit of the breakfast and whatever i had was nice...There was some wall patchwork done which was really visible on the bedside, and sm of the woodwork needed a new varnish but it was still a really nice stay. Oh just one more thing maybe maybe they could have a few more ppl at the front desk i, waited a good 15 minutes before the three could maybe tend to my checkout (which was performed by smone other than the actual front desk staff). "
the lalit new delhi ,"Excellent 5 Star hotel Really first cladd hotel, or both business and pleasure, Spotlessly clean, excelent service. The outdoor pool is perfect. Food is good - especially the choice at buffet breakast (so make sure its included in your rate) - fresh fruit, omelettes/eggs cooked to order, Japanese - and of course Indian (so if you'e new to India, this is a safe intro to the joys of dosas, vadi, bhajis, uppam etc!). The Spa is World class too - but priced accordingly (ie its not cheap).The newly renovated rooms on the upper floors have everythig you could ever need - great bathrooms, massive flat screen TV etc.Tip: use black &amp; yellow taxi's to get around (negotiate fixed price) - the Lalits own car may be air-con - but its also at least 5 times as expensive. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Need to train their support staff The stay was comfortable, and few support functions were good. I was in Delhi on a business trip and hence did not spend much time in the room though. Had to check in and out more than a couple of times due to my work schedule. Got different rooms each time and therefore was able to experience variety. At the reception, not always is the best room allotted even if requested for. Some support staff are terrible and need severe training. One of the managers at the reception was very helpful, even when the credit card system was not operational. Overall a good experience, but need to put their act together given their positioning. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Lalit well situated but.... My friend and I stayed here for 4 days in late November. The Lalit was formerly the Intercontinental; it was taken over by Indian hotel magnate Lalit Suri. We had booked our reservation at the Intercon so were surprised to see the Lalit sign and flags in front - we thought the cab driver dropped us at the wrong hotel! It just so happened that we arrived on the day the new name was unveiled.The entrance to the hotel is almost right off the street, so no grounds to speak of. The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated with modern flair and some enormous paintings of the Suri family. Check in was smooth, although the staff were not especially pleasant. The hotel has several elevators, but it always seems to be a long wait to catch one.Rooms are modern and well appointed. We stayed in a standard room with 2 double beds - it was a little cramped, but comfortable and clean. The hotel has a very cosmopolitan feel, with travelers from many different countries. We met people from Africa, China, Europe and Australia and the US. It is situated about a 15 min walk to Connaught Place and within short driving distance to many historical and modern attractions. There are some great restaurants and bars serving international fare in Connaught Place - ask the concierge at the hotel to make reservations for you.Our biggest complaint was dining at the Lalit. There is a buffet restaurant to the right of the main lobby, but there wasn't much variety nor was the food very good. We had to wait a long time for a server to take our drink orders, and dishes were not cleared away in a timely manner so ended up crowding our table. There is also a pastry shop that at that time did not sell coffee or small pastries that you could grab on the run. The 24/7 Bar only served food/snacks while the buffet restaurant was open, and it was the same stuff as served in the buffet.We also tried to eat at Woks because we had heard some good things about it, but after waiting 2 hours were still not seated. It got so late we just got take out and took it back to our room. After all that, the food was disappointing - greasy and tasteless. Needless to say, after that we just ate off site.Overall - nice, well kept hotel, well situated. Service was passable. Just find other places to eat. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Excellent Hotel in Convenient Part of City Great large Rooms and ovesized modern bathrooms. Nice views as well. Ate at two of the hotel restuarants, WOK on the top floor surpassed expectations with excellent food, though slow service. The cafe on the 3rd floor was mediocre at best. Service was excellent throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend the hotel for both business and leisure. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Business friendly hotel Good business hotel, right in the heart of delhi.situated in the CBD of CP/Barakhamba road and very close to Barakhamba metro station, this hotel smacks of business opulence. I stayed here for almost three months and became and gold member of priority club.The deals are normally around 10k INR per night though it might rise upto 15k in the busy season.it has one of the two heated swimming pools in all of delhi.Okish restaurents but the coffee shop has a lavish spread for breakfast. The best thing about this was the quality of the rooms - lots of gadgets, transparent glasses for bathroom walls and clean look to the entire place.I recommend this. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Loved the Bathroom I stayed in the hotel in the month of April '09. The hotel is magnificent and I have just loved the bathroom which has a glass wall. It is so lovely that it was hard to drag myself away from the bath to the room. It was so hot and busy there, I couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the bath. I was expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc. Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that! The hotel lobby is splendid with very good decor &amp; ambience. 3 things I would like the hotel to look into:- The interiors of the rooms need to be done up. In my room the walls hd some cracks &amp; patchwork of painitngs were clearly visible which does not shw the hotel in the right perspective.- The other thing I would like to highlight is that the hotel still does not have a loyalty program &amp; no tie ups with any airlines. This is a little bizarre consideing the tough competition that the industry is in.- Airport pickups &amp; drops are charged......this is something weird I found!! In my view one of the journeys could be charged, but not both!! BUT overall I would say this is probably the best hotel I have stayed in off late. Perhaps not the most convenient if you have business in Gurgaon!! But if you want to mix of good food, service with the odd trip to connaught place then this is an absolute must!!Do pay heed to my suggestions....Lalit will definitely go a long way in fulfilling Mr. Lalit Suri's dreams!! "
the lalit new delhi ,Great service I was at The Lalit during a period of 2nights. I visited Delhi for business purpose and decided to be put up at The Lalit. My decision was wise as the service rendered was very pleasing.The staff was extremely courteous. The food was authentic and delicious. I was extremely happy with their service &amp; I shall always recommend The Lalit to everybody. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Best for Business events - Stay is calm- Staff very good- Excellent place for business events- Food, excellent and having real taste of India- Location: in middle of Delhi- Airport is just 30 to 40 minutes away. "
the lalit new delhi ,nice stay Much more than expected. I went Delhi to attend a national meeting. My company opted me to stay at hotel lalit. The ambience of hotel is very gud. Service is very fast and courteous.I liked the food and dining of this hotel very much. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Great new location old refurnished classy hotel the Lalit is the newer version of the Old Intercontinental hotel which used to be there. taken over by a new management, this hotel is very much up to the mark.great place to be, an absolute 5 star...ciaoronak "
the lalit new delhi ,Advantage Location This hotel is in heart of Delhi and is the best in terms of location and logistics.The food in all the returants at this place is fingerlicking good.The rooms are sufficently large with spacious washrooms.The gym and the spa at this place is really good.Overall this is a good hotel in the heart of Delhi 
the lalit new delhi ,"Looks good but too many niggles ... February 2009 saw my first stay at the renovated Lalit after several stays there in the 'old days'. On arrival the hotel looks very impressive but it didn't really live up to expectations due to a number of small problems. Check in was very slow and complicated which was very frustrating as we arrived at 10:30pm. I was travelling with an Indian colleague and we both had to endure a lengthy (and unnecessary) form filling exercise which apparently is part of their procedures. Although the hotel has been renovated the old lifts remain which are rather slow and one of my pet hates. The rooms have been very well decorated with comfortable beds and a huge flat screen television. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the proximity to the railway station can make for a rather noisy night. Although very busy I have to say that breakfast is superb with an enormous array of food to cater for all tastes and dietary requirements. Another problem came on check out where I was significantly UNDERCHARGED on my bill and had to wait until it was corrected. Overall you will be comfortable and well looked after at the Lalit, they just need to work a bit harder on some of the smaller things, particularly at reception. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Grand ..... I thought the hotel was stunning .... i can see on the site that people had poor service well that was not experience ... there was a missing bathrobe in my room one day which I needed to go the swimming I had one in less than 5mn upon request.I used all the services the gym , the spa, the swimming pool, the traditional Indian restaurant everything was a delight.... Considering it was 43C when I visited the hotel was a peaceful and refreshing haven from the bustle and heat from the city "
the lalit new delhi ,"Not really a good hotel to stay I found their services to be very poor and staff reluctant to entertain the guests. The locker in the room was not working and at reception I asked them to keep my passport. They retorted by telling me that I should keep the passport in locker in the room. When I told them locker is not working, they said sorry but they can't keep. They didn't either change the room or got the locker repaired.This hotel is near by a railway station and it was difficult to sleep with trains hooting away whole night. "
the lalit new delhi ,Perfect Business Spot It is the perfect Business hotel in the heart of the city. The hotel has a great SPA which you should visit and use the facility. The resturant has a big spread of menu and food is average. Lot of place to hang around near by and shopping too. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Loved the new decor of hotel Visited this hotel on a business visit and was very pleased with the arrangements. The hotel is just renovated and it’s a great atmosphere to mix business with pleasures in that hotel. Rooms are very good and I enjoyed the stay. The only problem here is the STAFF not friendly, the room service takes a lot of time and most of the time the staff is too confused if you ask them anything, they are a bit rude a bit attitude problem I can say. Overall well equipped, good food, great bar a perfect place for business if they have a better staff. "
the lalit new delhi ,love 24/7 i like the overall experience ...and moreover i visit 24/7 very frequently ..im in love with it totally...coz you get liquor there 24/7 ..name suggests all ... 
the lalit new delhi ,Good Hotel for a Business Traveller A good-quality business hotel in a convenient location with excellent dining options. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Hate the place This was a crazy stay. Was booked for two nights with my family, but it was possibly the worst stay ever.Checkin etc was smooth, but the first evening, the air conditioner for the entire hotel went off. There was some scheduled maintenance going on and was supposed to go on for a couple of hours initially, but it went on till the next afternoon.In Delhi's heat, this five star hotel gave us a torrid time. The staff ran out of fans and we could not even open our window.The staff did not help much. I ended up arguing with them regarding the fare they were charging me. They had the gall to present me with a full bill on check out. It made me furious.Terrible, terrible, terrible.One positive thing about the hotel is it's good location. If you are willing to walk a few steps, CP is almost next door. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Better After Renovation The Lalit has come up with a New Look after Renovation , The Rooms are Much better and location as usual is good Close to many of the offices. The Restaurant is also very nice "
the lalit new delhi ,"Great Experience In totality it was a great experience. Food, stay was really satisfying and to add to that, slept really well after a really long work schedules. Service at the restaurant was good. The Hotel was very secure too. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Great place Stayed in the presidential suite for 1 night due to unavailability of space. Rate of 400 USD per night, did not matter since my client was paying! It was one of the best experiences of my life. The complementary wine, the jacuzzi and the rest of the services were first class. The brekfast was excellent as well. The decor was fantastic and the location of the hotel is perfect for access to central New Delhi. Recommended for anyone wanted to stay in an upmarket place "
the lalit new delhi ,"Dont touch the mini bar! Goes without saying I suppose, but tired and frazzled after a days travel the thought of a reviving G&amp;T is irresistble until you clock the prices in this hotel . R900for a gin or other spirit then add tax on top. They know how to charge here. Also beware of the buffet, average though it is, costs R1770. You expect excellent service at this price, but it took over an hour before I could get into my room as the wrong key card was issued 3 times. "
the lalit new delhi ,"intercontinental touch is missing... While, I had been going in this hotel for a while, this was part of the priority club and now probably independent and named as Lalit. The intercontinental touch is gone, the service level has gone down and I found the people to be more aloof than before. Their breakfast used to be one of the very best and very exhaustive. They were able to amintain that so far, however I see people are little disoriented now. The maintanance of their gym and swimming pool is also going poor now. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Lalit good value for money The Lalit has been through a major overhaul and the renovated rooms are well appointed with large flat TVs, glass walled bath and shower area and a huge glass window to give a view of the city.Elevators are still being upgraded to the wait is sometimes longer.Food was not upto the standards of the old hotel (Intercontinental). Breakfast was boring with only one fresh juice and one canned juice option. Usual eggs and sausage (no smoked salmon) and Indian parathas and dosas etc.The mini bar has flavoured water for Rs 175/- which is a total rip off. The hotel only gives you 2 small bottles of water per day which is not adequate.Staff is a bit uncertain at times, check out took a long time.All in all a good hotel at a modest price in New Delhi's Connaught Place area. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Very good hotel - would recommend it. Just back from a 4 night stay at The Lalit. Very impressed with the hotel - pick up from airport and check in were very smooth and quick and staff were all very friendly and eager to help. Really good location - very easy to get a taxi/auto rickshaw or even walk up to Connaught Place. The doormen were always ready to get you a taxi and not push the hotel cars.We had two double rooms on the 21st floor and, although you could see the railway line from one room, the noise from the trains was very distant and did not bother us at all. The rooms were very well equipped - the only thing lacking was the usual hotel guide, although there was a room service menu. The bathroom was very nice, but the mini bar was very sparsely stocked - only things in the fridge were one can each of coke and fanta!! (although they did provide 4 bottles of water every day). Breakfast was very good and we ate at the 24/7 lobby restaurant one night which was very nice, although the continual repeating chillout music got on your nerves after a while.My daughters really enjoyed the pool area - in particular the lovely lounging chairs on the edge of the pool and my eldest and myself used the spa and thoroughly enjoyed it - very reasonably priced, too. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if in New Delhi. Had a really nice short break on the whole and we were not harrassed half as much as we expected even though my 18 yr old has long blonde hair and attracted lots of 'friendly stares' and lots of requests for photographs! "
the lalit new delhi ,"great breakfast spacious clean room too much noise from trains excellent hotel in terms of cleanliness, service, quality of food (especially at breakfast) and safe. However, too close to train station, so lots of noise all night and day. Good location though. "
the lalit new delhi ,NAIL IN THE MAIN BED..GOT HURT DR IN HOTEL GAVE AN ANTI TITANUS INJECTION nail in the frame of the main bed which hurt me in the leg..a Dr was summoned and who gave an anti titanus injection...later i found other rooms carpertners banging away at the beds as they may have had the same problem also the hotel is too close to a railway station with trains hooting away day and night.. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Nice Comfortable Hotel Room for Improvement We stayed three nights in total with a wedding party. The hotel's decor is very impressive and modern. The rooms are comfortable and we had nice views of the city. The breakfast is decent but I've had better at similar level of hotels.The pool area is also newly renovated and is very nice. But I almost wished that it's indoor because the air in Delhi is just so polluted that it wasn't very enjoyable breathing in all the fumes and pollution while relaxing at the pool.The major complaint that I have is on the service. Check-in is extremely slow. If there were two or three people in front of you on line, be prepared to wait for over 20 minutes just to check in. We had to check in twice because our three nights were split up and both times we had similar experience.Also staff at front desk seem confused sometimes. One time a front desk person actually told me the wrong information regarding hours of the sauna room in the gym area. Another time I wanted to break a large bill and the person sent me down the desk to another area but ended with no one helping me. Despite the hiccups in service, it was a comfortable hotel and I would stay here again if I could get a good deal on a room. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good could do with some improvements I stayed at this Hotel for one night on a Business Trip to Delhi. Hotel is quite centrally located, thats a major plus point.Crowded Lobby, Check in was chaotic, took some time to get my room allocated. Staff seemed confused and unable to handle large crowds at the same time.Room was nice and spacious, excellent view of the city, large comfortable bed, clean and large bathroom. Room Amneties were excellent. They even had cellphone chargers for most models in the room. Tried out room service for dinner. Order arrived on time, Food was good, not excellent.Breakfast spread the next morning was basic, not something to write home about. The Lunch buffet was however excellent, though expensive.There are two things that I did not like about the Hotel.1. The staff tend to linger around waiting for tips, it happened to me thrice during my stay. This irritated me quite a lot.2. Though Recession has brought down Hotel Tariffs, the rates for the all the other services and facilities remain the same. It seems stupid to pay over inflated prices for almost everything when the same thing is available outside for 1/10th the price. So even though I was travelling on company expense, it pinched.overall an average experience. recommended for Business travel only. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Luxury Hotel Superb Location! Loved It!!!!!! I've just stayed at the Lalit with my family for 2 nights in March.. This hotel is definately worth it's points. The minute u walk in to the lobby, the features and decor are very modern. The service was great, I couldn't say a bad thing about it, the pool area was lovely, my kids loved it. I've stayed in some 5 star hotels before, but this was even better than the ones we've stayed in London. You wouldn't be disappointed, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There was alot of business people around, but on our second day there was a few more families. There is a pastry shop in the hotel which is not to badly priced, but other than that we ordered drinks at the poolside bar, which was very steep. We had breakfast in the 24/7 restaurant, which was lovely, it was probably the best meal my kids had had since we had been in India. There was such a wide range, to cater for all. The hotel also had agradin area, where daytime shows were on, also on the second floor the hotel has a range of boutiques and gift shops. The best thing about the Lalit was the location. It is literally 5 minute walk from Connaught Place, 5 minute car jouirney to the train station and it only took us half an hour in peak time to the Airport. Overall, I would say I made a very good choice staying at the Lalit. I'd been looking for accomadtion for nearly 2 months prior to my journey. Having 3 young children, I wanted a nice hotel, with a good pool and in a good location. I had firstly booked the Radisson, but cancelled last minute due to it's location. Lalit was definately very impressive! "
the lalit new delhi ,"The Lalit: A magnificent surprise in a great Delhi location I spent 4 days at this hotel in mid-Feb with my wife and son. The hotel was arranged by our Delhi office so I was a little surprised it was not a brand that I recognized....but boy, what an absolutely outstanding experience! While every aspect of my experience was great, with no negatives, here are the highlights:1. The people were the best thing about this hotel.....they were warm, friendly, polished and VERY hospitable. They made us feel really welcome and service was excellent at every place. (I thought they had mistaken me for some VIP, but my wife and son had the same experience). 2. The rooms were very nice..... bright, tastefully furnished, fairly large, and very well equipped. 3. The 24/7 restaurant is probably the best &quot;coffee shop&quot; I have experienced.....great food, served beautifully, in a very pleasant setting. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. While we had intended to eat out and try Delhi's many restaurants, we ended up eating here pretty much all the time, . 4. The facility overall was beautiful.....it was rich without seeming formal; very bright, airy, beautifully decorated, with a collection of art by top Indian artists. (It's the only hotel I know of that has a full-time curator! ).5. The location was superb....right in Connaught Place, in central Delhi. It is hard to find a better location in Delhi. It is close to shopping, business, government, parliament, the historic old Delhi, the newer monuments, etc.. Given Delhi's traffic congestion, that was a major boon. I understand that the hotel has been recently renovated, which I am sure added to its attractiveness, but I have to believe that the outstanding service and flawless operation we experienced was the result of excellent management. (And you could see them all over the place all the time!). Bottom line, a superb hotel we would gladly recommend to our friends. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Loved this hotel I loved this hotel! I've travelled a lot and this would have to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The room was fabulous, the staff were very attentive and helpful. The buffet was amazing - breakfast lunch and dinner and room service was spot on. The room was quiet, it had an ironing board - the only hotel I came across in India that had one!!! Attention to detail was excellent in the room - variety of newspapers, chocolates - all I can say was it was fantastic. Only downside was the pool was still closed for renovation, and the restaurant was a little expensive, but overall - I'd highly recommend it. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Recently renovated but pool is closed. Nicely renovated hotel. Good size rooms. Excellent interior decor. Somewhat noisy, even though our room was on a high floor. The hotel is right at the heart of the city. Dining is open 24/7, and breakfast is a tremendous feast. Pool is currently being renovated so is closed; gym is small but functional. "
the lalit new delhi ,a treat When we first arrived in New Delhi we stayed at the Shangri-La but found it to be rather cold &amp; standoffish. When we returned to new Delhi we went to check in at Shangri-La again but found they's increased the nightly rate over 25% or 120 USD in less than 2 weeks. We looked around and found La Lit to be the most reasonable luxury hotel that were willing to negotiate a fair price. The newly renovated rooms were stunning &amp; almost identical to rooms at the Shangri-La. We found the hotel atmosphere a lot friendlier and more welcoming and always bustling with locals and travellers. The breakfat buffet was outstanding! If given the choice would definately stay at La Lit! Would highly recommend this hotel- a real treat. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Excellently-designed city hotel dismal service We stayed at the Lalit recently on a visit to Delhi. The hotel has a lot of strong points...the design is top-notch: rooms are spacious, comfortable and fitted with high-quality and modern finishings/furnishings - you get what you pay for. The hotel is within walking distance of Connaught Place shopping and dining, metro stations and even some other sites of interest. The 24/7 restaurant downstairs is fantastic, offering one of the best selections of food I have seen at a hotel in India. The major let-down were the poor response to some of the simply requests we had made, such as a packed breakfast, water, information, etc...I was expecting better. Extra services are mostly overpriced and poor in quality, as well. Overall, the accomodation represents the price you pay in an expensive city like Delhi, but they really need to work on their confused, disinterested staff. I did not encounter any signs of renovation work during my stay. Maybe it is over? "
the lalit new delhi ,Impressed! This hotel is now called &quot;The Lalit - New Delhi&quot;.I stayed at this hotel for four nights. The hotel was under renovation at the time of my stay (including rooms and public spaces). I stayed in a recently renovated room. The room was very nice. Service throughout my stay was excellent. I ordered room service once (excellent and reasonably priced) and had multiple meals in the lobby dining area (24/7). The breakfast buffet is a decent value although the lunch buffet is very pricey (~$40/pp).I would definitely stay at this hotel again. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Avoidable hotel My experience was similar to that of Isabella. I stayed last week for 3 nights.Lobby and rooms are fine like most economical 5 stars but the hotel is undergoing major repair and therefore very noisy. Though the management always says that the work is mostly over or they stop work in the night if guests object etc but the fact is throughout the day and night carpenters, electricians and masons keep working and stop for 15 minutes if you object repeatedly and then resume work again which at times is very noisy. Very difficult to find restful sleep in this hotel. Besides, the hotel is very close to the train tracks and train make a big siren to keep people away from passing the tracks.Staff is a mixed lot, some are very polite and some very rude.Avoidable hotel. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Worth the price...if the price is mid-market My experience was most similar to IsabellaNewYork in her review below. There are some real nice touches in this hotel: recently-renovated rooms are modern and attractive with a big flatscreen TV and funky bathrooms. Also, the morning breakfast was very good, and I didn't have the service problems that others had. In fact, it seems like the staff may have recently had a training course, since they were frequently extremely solicitous. I would add that there is also a nice gym on the mezzanene floor that is open 24/7.On the other hand, this is still a work in progress. I can report that, as of late December, the loud bangings associated with continued renovations are ongoing, though I never experienced it late at night. Also, my room (like IsabellaNewYork's) was on the side with the train station, and while I got used to the constant whistles, it would be a much better experience on the other side of the building. Having traveld to India in the immediate aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, I was able to negotiate a much cheaper rate than TripAdvisor is listing (my rate was about $180), which I think is a very good deal given the high price of business hotels in Delhi and the many near-5-star ammenities this hotel offers.As others have noted, this hotel has shed its association with the InterContinental chian and is now called the Lalit New Delhi. All cabbies seem to know it as the InterContinental still, however. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Really good Hotel This is really excellent hotel, with exception: they did some works by night and there was more dust on the floor in front of hotel (in the morning). I came in Hotel very often early in the morning (01.00 - 03.00 o'clock) and must walking under the wall-workers -construction), on the other entrance and so on.Service was OK, food, people are very kind. "
the lalit new delhi ,Overpriced The hotel has some great plusses and a few major negatives. Reception staff do not seem able to cope and are quite rude and off hand. Checking in is slow and my luggage took nearly forty minutes to arrive after completing the formalities. The lift service is totally inadequate. I regularly waited over five minutes for a lift to arrive (either on the lobby level or on the 18th floor where my room was located) and then it stopped at nearly every floor. The 24/7 restauant (main cafe style buffet eatery) serves excellent food but is very expensive compared to other indian hotels - rip off levels. The bedroom was superb with every comfort imaginable and excellent bathroom. Good location but the overall package could be so much better. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Nice stay The hotel has been recently renovated. The new look is very contemporary. Our stay was great, the rooms have a very modern look. The front facing rooms have a beautiful views. The bathrooms are very spacious. The restaurants especially 24/7 and Baluchi are very good. "
the lalit new delhi ,"awefull This is a rip off joint. I have stayed in hotels ranging 3 star to 7 stars but this is the only one which wouldn't give any star ever. They charge like they are the best hotel in new delhi but other than that they have nothing. I'd have been better off in a B&amp;B for 2000Rs. Thats how much I think they should charge.No customer service, aweful food, construction and wierd check in process on 3-4th floor. The lady was good looking though.Thanks "
the lalit new delhi ,"Problematic hotel with potential Service in this hotel is hit and miss. Sometimes excellent and friendly, sometimes incompetent and rude. Overall, the hotel definitely has a long way to go to provide a consistent 5 star experience. Room was nice and very modern, with flat screen TV and a futuristic bathroom. Room had absurdly loud noise coming from a nearby commuter railway station. Trains were making piercing signals at all hours to warn people off the tracks. Have never experienced such noise levels in a hotel room, despite years of travelling around Asia. If you stay in this hotel, make sure to get a room away from the railway station!Hotel is 5 minutes walking distance from Connaught Place, a big shopping area that is dirty and has been decaying for decades. The area is nevertheless popular with tourists, and has a couple of decent restaurants.A couple of nights I was woken up around 1 am from loud banging that went on for a couple of hours: extensive renovation work is going on in the hotel at all hours.Breakfasts were excellent. Nice, bright restaurant and wide food selection. Staff sometimes seem tired and unmotivated. Getting a coffee refill is often a challenge.Dinner in the same restaurant was a depressing affair. When I pointed out that a particular vegetable was missing from the pizza despite being mentioned on the menu, the waiter silently took the plate away. He returned about seven minutes later, having added the missing vegetables on the original dish. The pizza by now was cold and even less appetizing. Another time, a salad in the main restaurant was mediocre.Room service was disappointing, to say the least. &quot;Grilled vegetables'&quot; turned out to be an unappetizing soup-like dish that was inedible. A sandwich was soggy an also unappetizing. Coffee was so weak it looked like weak tea. It is very hard to believe that any professionally trained chef could have had any hand in this food fiasco!Internet in the room is horrendously expensive, at 1.248 rupees including tax (more than 26 USD!). The login-process is clunky and sometimes problematic.Elevators are often malfunctioning, and there are often long waiting times.Indian newspapers have reported that starting next year, this hotel will no longer be part of the Intercontinental chain. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Exellent hotel This is a very good quality hotel, excellent facilities, huge, beautiful rooms, very clean, spectacular breakfasts, good restaurants, good service, very safe, knowledgeable staff. Would definitely go there again. "
the lalit new delhi ,"under renovation for at least one month or two ! We booked in this hotel for 2 nights in august to have some restfrom busy india, during august in delhi choose a hotel with swimming pool if possible its so hot !Well the reservation office forgot to tell us that the whole building and swimming was under renovation, that means dust and noise we chose a standard room, they gave us a suite but when the door lift opened, clouds of dust and noise invaded the corridor, it was like a joke movie.... we ran away from the hotelI wouldnt recommend this hotel for its lack of information or sincerity... "
the lalit new delhi ,"Totally Horrible Service Stayed there from 16-19 May. It was horrible experience. The staff was unfriendly. I arrived in the hotel at midnight. When I lined up for check-in at 3rd floor, the staff gave a head signal to the bellboy and asked him to take me to international club at 20th flr for check-in. That was really rude. She didn't even bother to say anything to me. The hotel is going through renovations. I could hear the noise/bang sound when I woke up in the morning. I still could hear the bang when I came back to the hotel before dinner time. The TV and telephone in my room didn't work at all. I used my international mobile to call receptionist and informed her that telephone in my room didn't work. All TV channels, except one, had no signals. It took forever for them to fix this.Unless the hotel upgrades their quality of service and improves its staff etiquette and professionalism, this hotel does not deserve to be called 'class hotel'.I really hate this hotel and will never recommend it to my friends and networks! "
the lalit new delhi ,"Best value ""good"" hotel in Delhi great gym. The intercontinental is my hotel of choice for Delhi. In an expensive city, it offers good value. As already noted, the renovations are not too disturbing.The rooms are fantastic and the hotel's best feature. Most if not all have plasma tvs and great bathrooms. The gym/spa is fantastic and a great way to finish the day. The restaurant is also excellent, open 24 hours (and experienced this by ordering a steak at 3am - perfect) and the bars offer a wide choice. The location is brilliant and if you dont want to pay c.£200, this is a great option. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Beware of the renovations! Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days R&amp;R and sightseeing at the end of a business trip in the region and have to say I was disappointed.The location of the hotel is great, on the edge of the Government district of new Delhi but within very easy walking distance of Connaught Place - but the quality did not live up to my expectations of an Inter-continental.The main thing to frustrate me was that the hotel is currently in the midst of major renovations. The lobby is reduced to being a corridor - some of the lifts are out of action and significantly, the pool and surrounding area is completely a building site. The pool is to be closed for 3-4 months apparently. Hammering and drills started at 8 in the morning and carried on until late at night. Worst of all however - even though I only booked 2-3 weeks before travle, I was told none of this and there was no mention on the hotel website.I did stay in one of the renovated rooms and it was very nice (if slightly small) but there were clearly teething problems. My broadband wouldn't work so I had to call a guy to come and set me up with a separate connection each time I needed to go on line. And the cost of the broadband was extortionate! The 24hour restaurant was unaffected by the renovation but the food was ok at best - breakfast was a big disappointment. Room service was polite and prompt with a good selection, but again food quality was average at best.In summary, great central location, with the potential to be great - but get the renovations out the way first, and then expect to pay over the odds for average food and service "
the lalit new delhi ,"The Level of Service is Impressive I am on a PC points stay at this property. As an Royal Ambassador, this is the best value in the system. The level of service and attention to detail is extrordinary. My sense is tht they deeply care about the people staying at the hotel. Because I am here for medical reasons, the location of this hotel is ideal -- 2 blocks from Bengali Market. 3 Blocks from connaught place.The rennovated rooms are very nice if you don't want a suite. I would opt for an executive suite or luxury suite in the Presidential tower. I stayed 2 nights in 1115. Very quiet. looks over the pool (now close d for rennovation). But the two luxury suites on the 21st floor are good for sleeping. Room 2121 has a great view of the cricket fields at the Modern school, and the view wraps around. It's pretty spectacular.If you are an PC Ambassador, the club lounge has breakfast 8-10:30, tea 3-5, and cocktails 6:30-8:30. It is on the 20th floor right below 2121. The 21st floor presidential rooms have no one on top of you. They are very quiet--but not yet rennovated.The elevators are under wraps right now so sometimes you might have to wait. But the new spa, steam room, suana and gym portend a bright future for this property once it is completely rennovated. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Comfortable stay. Stayed at &quot;The Grand&quot; from 25th to 28th Feb. We had travelled up from Goa and looked forward to our first trip to Delhi. I had pre paid for the room and check in was efficient and professional. I requested a renovated room and was given a beautifully apointed room on the 11th floor. Rm 1127. The room was very confortable and you can request harder pillow if the soft pillows are not to your liking. I was already aware of the ongoing renovations but wasn't aware that the pool is also closed. It didn't affect our stay as the visit was short. We availed of the buffet meals every day and the quality was excellent if not a little expensive by Indian standards. The location is excellent and it is only a short walk to Connaught Place. We also walked to India Gate. Taxis are easy to to arrange with the consierge staff. The only &quot;not so positive&quot; incident happened at checkout. I was given my bill and the hotel had again charged me for the accomodation that I had already pre paid. I didn't notice until I had left the desk. I returned to the desk and pointed out the error. The situation was recitified but it was done with a grimace from the desk. I was not offered an apology or an explanation. However, I have booked again to stay from 3rd to the 6th June 2008. I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Delhi. The renovations are hardly noticable and the staff are generally professional and helpful.Ken Brydon and PJ Hogan "
the lalit new delhi ,"In spite of ongoing renovations - a class hotel Over the past several years I have stayed at the Grand on at least five occasions - and if it was as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be, I would not have stayed there as often as I did. In fact, for New Delhi it is very good. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza (Friends Colony), Le Meridien, the Maurya Sheraton and the Imperial, and for comfort, value and service, it is the equal of all but the Imperial, which I rate as one of the world's great hotels. The renovated club rooms are superb.No doubt it is expensive, nearly $500 a night for a renovated club during a high demand period (during an international trade fair), but similar hotels in New Delhi are even more expensive. When I visited, the hotel was still undergoing renovations - the lobby was restrictive and the pool closed. However, other than that there were no impositions on the guests. The Indian restaurant (Baluchi?) on the third floor was superb and good value for a 5 star hotel in New Delhi. The Chinese Restaurant on the roof top was disappointing. The 24/7 bar in the lobby has gone modern (glass and clean lines) and not to my taste - I preferred the old Champions Sports Bar which it replaced. Having said that, it is a good watering hole, excellent service, good selection of drinks and best of all, open 24 hours a day.For the business traveller this is a very good hotel - good rooms (renovated ones), good service and good location. I would also recommend this hotel for the tourist, especially if they can get a discounted rate. A very satisfactory hotel, indeed. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good for business travellers and tourist This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Delhi. Facilities are good, even if at the present time (02/2008), some refurbishing work is causing some limited access to the lobby. I have used the internal travel agency to arrange a one day tour of the town and I have been very pleased of the service offered. I paid 1000 rupees (20$) for a full day group tour; it turned out that the group was only a party of three and the guide was excellent, he spoke a good english, was very well prepared and ready to answer any question. I have also tried two internal restuarants, offereng respectively indian and chinese food. A little bit pricey (50$ for a good dinner, without wine) but still acceptable. Main negative point is the noise from the nearby railway line, quite loud.Overall I can recommend this hotel to both business travellers and tourists. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Not worth the high cost The hotel is undergoing some major construction. The lobby is not really a lobby with the construction going on. The taxi and rickshaw drivers have a tough time finding this place for some reason. We were put in a room that is not renovated yet. It was ok, but the renovated section looks so much better. The rooms are very spacious. The hotel seems to be more of a business type hotel. It just didn't justify the price we paid for it.The concerige service is not very helpful and quite unfriendly. The room service and restaurants are very good. Everything I ordered was very tasty. I don't think I would stay here again. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Fantastic After reading the mixed reviews on here I had fairly low expectations about this hotel. In fact it was a fantastic surprise. The renovation works continue but are now of minimum disruption and the newly refurbished areas are really great, with very modern and cool design. The reception area was not completely finished although even here you can see how good it's going to look. We were given one of the refurbished rooms on the 21st floor and it was very cool with great piture window, modern interior design, giant LCD TV and DVD, cool bathroom with seperate rainshower.The heated (useful in January) outdoor swimming pool on one of the hotel's roofs is a real bonus as it's wonderful to escape to this tranquil space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Delhi city centre. It was dissapointing that the spa was more or less out of service, with just some basic facilities available. The hotel's website is kept up to date with what is and is not available during the works though.The Grill restaurant on the top floor has a great menu and they're happy to make something off menu for you if you ask. The quality's great. Breakfast's also top notch. I stayed in the Taj Palace a few weeks earlier and much prefered the Intercontinental Grand. It's much cooler, has more buzz and a better location all for a similar price. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Expensive ( 314€/night) - in Indian comparison This place is way too expensive by India comparison. And by international comparison as well. Even in Tokyo you can stay at cheaper price and with more comforts.LOCATIONNote that there is anotehr The Grand New Delhi in the city as well. This place has nothing to do with Intercontinental The Grand. Taxi driver may have problems finding this place even though it is supposedly centrally located. So have the address at hand. And even if you have the address taxies may not find the place. Intercontineltal The Grand states it is on the Marakhambra Avenue, off Connaught Place. In reality it is some 700 metres from Connaught Place and not on Marakhambra Avenue but on a small side street off it and next to the highway and very close to the railway. You can here the trains passing by in rooms facing east.ROOMSStay away of the old rooms at all cost. The new rooms are very very nice (see prictures). However at over 300€ per night these are way too expensive. Especially by international comparison. Furthermore, hotels on Jampath are more centrally located - and some of them cheaper.HOTEL PREMISESThe lobby area was undergoing a major refurbisment in December 2007. Check in facilities were crammed to one corner while the whole otherwise big lobby was closed off for renovations. Pool area is a serous need of renovation as well. Gladly the pool was heated. Restaurant on the ground floor is of international standard - but at similar of even higher prices.RECOMMEDATIONInstead of the big international names I would look for a 3 star Indian operated place close to Jampath. You'd get more value for you money - at a fraction of the cost. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Short stay in a flash one The room rate was extortionate (US$550/night plus taxes) but the room was incredible. How the team here made a small room into a masterpiece of open space architecture is incredible. The illusion of a large room is great. If you are a Hotel Architect, go here and check out the magic.Very impressed with the small things too like International Power Plugs as standard!The renovations down stairs were still on and that also affected the Gym setting. The pool meshed over is an interesting concept but it does not keep out the smog!.The breakfast setting was stunning and the ground floor restaurant is brilliant. There is tons of choice for food at breakfast here.Loved it...except for the room rate!ProsBest room setting for standard hotelBreakfast!Service was exceptional in all aspectsConsRoom price "
the lalit new delhi ,"Avoid at all costs! Stayed on 18th Nov fortunately for only one night. As foyer is being rebuilt we were sent to a waiting area on first floor to check in. This backed on to the works and we were seperated by only a short wallfrom the building going on. It was extremeley dusty and noisy. One worker was arc welding a few feet from where we were sitting! The man who came to check us in was oblivious to the problem. We were in the unmodernised rooms. These are disgraceful. The carpets were badly stained and sticky. The bath was badly rusted around the waste and looked dirty. The new rooms may be nice but the old ones would do shame to a one star hotel. We went into the restaurant to see if we could have a meal. We were told that only meal available was Sunday Brunch. Thiis was a buffet costing 3,000 rupees each (about £40 ). We had no alternative but to go for this as there are no nearby restaurants. 20 minutes after going in we were told that the buffet was closing in 2 minutes. Sure enough in 2 minutes they started to clear away the food. No one had bothered to tell us that the buffet was about to close when we went in. We were still charged the 3.000 rupees.Do not go near this hotel! "
the lalit new delhi ,The Intercontinental The Grand Delhi We stayed at the Intercontinental during a short business trip intending to stay longer when the trip was ended but we changed our minds. The new rooms are big and have a glass walled see through bathroom but not a single mirror lit properly to apply make up in my case or shave in my husbands case -too trendy by half. A plasma screen TV not programmed in in either room we stayed in. The main problem alongside the constant renovation is that there is no decent outside space.The terrace by the dining room could be nice but has an extractor fan from the kitchen fed directly onto it and the poolside is grubby and meshed over and is not welcoming. For a business stay make it short and for a holiday go to a hotel with an outside space or a garden.Ask for a room overlooking the pool - otherwise the railway station keeps you awake all night. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Great Stay I was in new Delhi for business and stayed at the Intercontinental Grand. I think that this hotel is great! I was upgraded to a Club Room with free breakfast. I love the contemporary feel of the Intercontinental. Although it is undergoing renovations, my stay was very comfortable. Staff are great and I have really nothing to complain about. The chauffered mercedez car that we hired from the hotel for 3 days also made our journey through meetings in New Delhi very easy and the driver has great knowledge of the area. He brought us to interesting tourist areas in between our meetings. The Wok restaurant at the 28 level has amazing food. The breakfast served at &quot;24/7&quot; restaurant was adequate. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Rip of After reading other reviews, I got a renovated room, so far so good. The decoration is Ok for a 5 star hotel. Service I received was only 2 star class worth, for exemple the shower was not ounes cleaned during my stay, also they never vacuumed the room. The breakfast was very basic. The rate for such hotel + service is a real rip of. "
the lalit new delhi ,"On its way up. I stayed at the Intercontinental - The Grand last week for 2 mights while in Delhi on business. Its the second time I've stayed in this hotel, the first time was about 2-3 years ago, and its definately improving.A few words of warning. The hotel is currently under rennovation, and so the lobby is a real mess. Its all boarded up and there is no where to sit. They told me that 3/4 of the rooms have already been rennovated, and I was upgraded from a regular king room to a &quot;club&quot; room. From my room I wasn't disturbed by the noise of the rennovations, but the smell of paint in the lobby is almost overwhelming. They also told me rennovations will be complete by March 2008, so keep all this in mind.I remember from the last time I was there the rooms were typical Indian old style, carpet on the floors and classic furniture. They were nice rooms but they were nothing fancy. Certainly well below what you would expect from an Intercontinental. But the rennovated rooms are absolutely superb. Parquet floors, a bed that was on par with Shangrila beds (which are my usual favorite), modern decorations, a 42&quot; plasma TV, and a fantastic bathroom with a separate bath and a huge rain shower. The bathroom has glass walls so you can watch CNN while you're in the shower (or on the loo!). I have to say the room was trully 5 star. There was also a nice big desk and a comfortable office chair, the same one that is pretty much standard for Intercontinental. One gripe, the internet connection was good, but very expensive. After tax it was 1250 rupees (about 25 euros) for 24 hours, which is ridiculous.I ate the buffet in the 24/7 cafe. The cafe/restaurant itself has been fully renovated and is very nice. The food was excellent, but typically expensive - about 2000 rupees for lunch or dinner per person. Service was excellent.The gym was a bit of a dissapointment - very small and no eliptical cross trainer. Hopefully that will also eventually be changed. Location is good, very central in Delhi.Overall, the hotel is definately going in the right direction. Its well on its way to a genuine Intercontinental standard. One note: Hotels in New Delhi are INSANELY over-priced. I paid 16000 rupees per night (including the luxury tax) which was the lowest rate I could find in any decent hotel in New Delhi. When you compare the room I had with rooms at the Park, or the Metropolitan, or even the Le Meridien, where the rooms were even more expensive, I rate this hotel as excellent value, all things considered. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good Hotel for India Stayed 2 nights and 1 night on seperate visits to hotel in both new and old rooms. I thought the standard of both types of rooms were fairly good; particularly nice beds. The older rooms aren't as nice as the very modern new ones, but the older room I got was much larger. Renovation noise was noticable but I sleep pretty soundly; probably not a good idea to stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper till they finish. Service is good if you are persistent (like everything in India, things take time and patience). I got some decent food through room service. Breakfast is particularly good. Overall, I'd say it's a good hotel but I'm not too sure I'd pay the full retail price for it (which I didn't). "
the lalit new delhi ,"watch the phone calls Watched the phone calls...They rip you stupid in this hotel.I got charged a 12.5% luxury tax on REVERSE charge international calls that NOONE answered at the other end.Paid $4000 rupee for a total of 5 min of calls.Breakfast buffet was pretty good and rooms are very nice, but the views are horrible. "
the lalit new delhi ,"nice rooms This hotel is very old. There is some construction going on, so you might find it a little annoying. Restaurnants and bar are disappointing and pricy. I paid $198/night which I consider as a really good deal since hotels in Delhi tend to be very expensive. Service was excellent and my room was very well decorated and clean. They have DVD players in each room. I brought some DVDs and watched all of them! Internet access is expensive. I paid Rs.1,000/24hrs (about USD25.) Most nice hotels in the U.S. charge $9.99/day, so this is absolutely a lot. Location is ok. It's quite far to Connaught place to walk. But you can always take the subway(only one stop to Connaught place,) or taxi. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Grand Ripoff Ideal location and earnest labor staff aside, the hotel is poorly managed, ridiculously expensive and oddly designed Poor management * Power outages are a norm* Electrical issues in rooms* Missed wakeup call* Uncoordinated reception staffRidiculously Expensive* laundry bill for 1 tshirt, 1 track suite, pair of socks and undershirt was Rs. 1900 = $50+. Criminal.* Internet per day is $30+ (Rs. 1000). Again outrageous.* Cheaper room are in construction areas -- avoid unless you like the smell of varnish and paint and the noise of a hammerOdd Design* trying to be post-modern without following basic design principles* oddest shower stall i have seen* no room to put away clothes* a/c that makes certain areas too cold and the rest of room not as coldEarnest Labor Staff* Not the well-dressed reception area staff who are mostly incompetent, but the poorly paid room service staff and the engineering labor staff.All in all, a hotel that pretends to be something that it isn't and probably doesn't know and doesn't care. For the money you have to pay, there are surely better deals in New Delhi. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good business hotel in city center This InterContinental property is managed and run by an Indian hotel group which owns &quot;The Grand&quot; brand in India. The hotel is very centrally located if you are on business at Delhi. The recently renovated rooms are great - especially those in the executive floor. A glass-walled bathroom, big-size plasma tv, good bedding, comfortable work desk and top-of-the-line amenities makes the room experience satisfying. The executive lounge is great with nice range of drinks and some finger foods. A good place to socialize and do quick business meetings. The breakfast is good - both on spread as well as on quality. The hotel is undergoing a renovation which can cause some minor disturbance (especially the noise) during your stay. I would recommend this hotel only for those who needs a hotel close to city center. If you are okay with any place in Delhi, you may find a better hotel at a much better price. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Charmless but the hotel is going through renovation The hotel is currently being renovated: ask for one of they renovated bedroom which are very nice, preferably facing the pool (and not facing the train station as it can be very very noisy.)Rooms and restaurant are quite expensive and in my opinion is not worth it. It might be when the hotel will be fully renovated: currently there is no terasse to enjoy a drink in the evening or have your diner. The bar is pretty horrible (undergoound, loud western music, big screen tv, smoky). All in all it is charmless although my bedroom was nice. I was meant to stay 2 weeks, @ $180 a night. I stayed one week and moved to the Imperial for the same price (booked on the net) which is just FANTASTIC. If you want to spend this sort of money in a hotel, do not chose the Grand, or at least not before it is fully renovated. "
the lalit new delhi ,Musty rooms and not very clean This was not the most expensive place in Delhi and it showed. Our room was very musty and not very clean. Construction was in progress in some of the hotel. We found a much better place for much less money on the south side of Delhi at the end of our trip. 
the lalit new delhi ,Floors that should have been closed in this hotel We recently stayed in this hotel between 14th and 17th April. We were given rooms on 18th and 21st floors (2 occasions). Renovation was ongoing with considerable noise through the day starting at 8.00am to around 6.00pm.Because of the summer heat in Delhi we had to return to the hotel in the afternoons and there was no peace bacause of the noise. This was pointed out to the Customer Relations saffed by a very young inexperienced girl who had to refer to the Manager on duty. The Manager's response was that of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; that is your choice. I can understand his attitude as the rooms were booked through a local travel agent who had been pre-paid.The most polite personnel in the hotel were the lift and baggage attendants. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Nice 4 star hotel in a not so nice area. I was going to India for a week and was terrified to read the reviews of the hotels in Delhi. They all said the hotels were expensive and below par. Well this hotel was very expensive but I have to say it was a solid 4 star hotel. Everything about it was great including the pool, bar, and restaurant. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel staff is that the doorman, who is a large turbine headed man, would give me dirty looks when I gave him a 20 rupee tip for getting me a cab. I though this as uncalled for since the I was told the daily wage in Delhi for a laborer is 80 rupees a day. The hotel restaurant was very expensive with dinner buffet costing about $40 US. But the food was outstanding with a wide variety of continental and Indian foods. So I ate there more than once and enjoyed it.The hall on my floor did smell of insecticide but on the positive note there were no insects. The hotel states that it is on Conneaut Circle which is the center of Delhi. Well it is not on the Circle but about a mile from it. And with the beggars, hawkers and traffic it is only walk able during the day if you have some courage. But it is not walkable at night. And the problem of getting one of the taxis is that I found them quite unreliable with them taking me constantly to their shops or just out of the way. And another point is that once you are in Conneaut Circle there is not much there aside from more beggars and hawkers. I found one decent coffee shop and no restaurants. So if you stay at the hotel don’t think that you will be walking out and be in the center of a cosmopolitan Mecca. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Do not recommend as far from ""Value For Money"" I frequently come to Delhi for business purpose and I wanted to experience this hotel.With my wife we stayed 4 nights in the first half of April '07. Room attributed to us ,thank to my Priority Club Member card was quite comfortable and well located. In fact we were lucky not to be disturbed by the noise resulting from the rehabilitation work currently in progress. We heard around us many complaints about this. Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the rest of the services.Quality of food available in Self Service Restaurant is relatively poor and choice limited. Certainly overpriced compared to the hotels within the same range.Expresso coffee at 5 USD , of very mediocre quality is more expensive than the express in some Palaces in Europe.Internet available in the Standard Room at 10 USD/ hour is absolutely scandalous. In some Guest House in Delhi/Gurgaon ( B&amp; B at USD 50- 70 ), WIFI internet is available and free!Staff at reception is nice but relatively slow.This Hotel is not reflecting the reputation of ICH group and needs serious improvements.We do not recommend this hotel for the moment. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Noisy and beware the renovations Checked in the afternoon after travelling for 27 hrs and got allocatted a smoking room which reeked of smoke. The room was shabby and needed a complete make-over. After complaining and requesting non-smoking room were offered a room &quot;newly renovated&quot; . Minimalist with a nice plasma screen. Nobody mentioned the fact that the floor's service area was still being renovated which was opposite our room.Needing some shut-eye the constant banging and knocking kept us awake. After calling reception and the duty manager around 7pm &quot;I will tell them to stop immediately&quot;. The banging continued for another 1.5hrs. Also the room was at the back of the hotel facing the railway station; so between the tooting of the trains throughout the night and the banging during the day we got very little sleep over the 3 nights we spent there. This impacted on the business meetings we had as we kept on dozing off!Being &quot;newly renovated&quot;, the bar fridge didn't work (fixed after five attempts by handymen) the hand basin didn't drain and there was a big gap in the ceiling above the shower rose. It seems that these details were not a problem with the front staff as nobody bothered to fix it-even after complaining. There were some big conferences on at the time so the hotel was quite full; explained the attitude of some of the front desk staff.The food at the breakfast buffet was OK but it was better to choose from the a la carte menu for dinner. Beware of the add on charges. We were quoted U$ 30 for 24 hrs of access to internet using wi-fi to which was added a service charge, government tax, as well as a luxury charge so ended up paying 35% more. Cheaper at the internet cafe near the hotel.If you do stay at the hotel ask for a renovated roon away from the railway station and certainly not where they are renovating. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Okay hotel but nothing special (maybe overpriced) I was here for just one day, but I must say that the hotel needs some upgrading. The rooms were perfect, but the lobby/reception could use some upgrading. The staff at the reception is very slow and inefficient. The restaurant is nice. Swimming pool closes too early. Location is fine. Make sure you're minibar is filled with all the things that should be in there!!! Breakfast in business lounge is rather limited I think. For the rest it is ok, but probably a bit overprices (as all hotels in Delhi). "
the lalit new delhi ,"OK Hotel I was somewhat cautious when I stayed here after reading the reviews, but we had no problems at all. I was travelling with 2 other work colleagues and this hotel met our needs just fine. The room was very quiet (aside from the occasional train tooting), but I had specifically asked for a quiet room, and I liked the large plasma TV in my room. Actually a colleague on the higher floor (more expensive), only had a normal Tv! Location is near Connaught place which is relativly central. The Bathroom was a little dark, and the bath tub had a stain in it. But overall for the price etc, I was satisfied with his hotel, plus I only slept and ate breakfast here (of which I liked the freshly cookedwaffles a lot). But avoid breakfast rushhour on Sunday around 10am, too many people! "
the lalit new delhi ,Fine for me- but I was lucky Having read the reviews I dreaded my stay.The room was clean enough- quiet enough-no problems...BUT- it seems I was lucky as other members of the party had had a noisy and miserable night. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Avoid bad experience I was on a 2 week business trip to India and was looking forward to my stay here as all the other hotels I have stayed in here have been excellent. However, this place has some major problems. All sorts of issues that add up to an irritating and unsatisfactory experience. First, I booked a non smoking room. When I went to check in there were no non smoking rooms available and they told me that I could have a smoking room and change tomorrow. When I book something normally it's booked - right? I didn't expect to book something and find it was not really booked. I got the impression there was a big conference that had block booked some rooms, and my one person stay was not too important to them. The room they put me in is above an intersection of 3 streets and as anyone knows who has been to India, on the streets they honk their car horns constantly. This would not have been a problem if the windows closed properly in the room, but they seem to be screwed in place, with some of the screws coming loose, with the effect that some of the windows don't open or close properly and the effect is that the car horn noise comes into the room constantly. The room is OK but pretty shabby. The front control panel is missing from the television. The bathroom does not look particularly clean. Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect. I was under the impression that having put me in a smoking room I didn't want when I arrived, that someone was going to call me the day after I arrived, to let me know when I was switching rooms - nothing happened. It is the service here that is really lacking. I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in (the ITC Sheraton &amp; Towers in Chennai), but the service here is poor by the normally high Indian standards. They have this system where you dial &quot;9&quot; for any requests, this links you their &quot;Instant Help Center&quot;. This is a good idea in principle, but the people who answer the phone have such a very poor grasp of English that it can be an irritating experience. I called &quot;9&quot; to ask they why I had not been contacted about changing rooms. They answered the phone with the words &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained the situation, long pause on the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;, I explained again, long pause at the other end of the line, the person then said &quot;can I help you sir?&quot;. You get the picture, you might as well talk to the cat. Instant, but not exactly help. I finally said, &quot;you can't understand anything I'm saying - can you?&quot;, they then said &quot;one moment sir&quot;, pause for 2 minutes of &quot;hold music&quot;. The receptionist was then out on the phone and gave me the impression that they had no intentions of contacting me about my room change, it was kind of up to me to remind them. Not impressive. I also asked them why it was 2pm and my room had not been cleaned. They said there must have been a &quot;DND&quot; notice on the room when the cleaner was there. Why do people in a customer care role use meaningless jargon when dealing with the public? I finally figured out that DND meant &quot;do not disturb&quot;. True - there was a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; notice on my room at 8am, but I'd kinda hoped that between 8am and 2pm a cleaner might have returned. The concierge service was a similarly disappointing experience. I went down there this morning and got some information about a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. The guy gave me some information and I said I'd think about it and come back later. About 4 hours later I went back to the concierge desk and it was unmanned. I waited, and waited and waited. Around 10 minutes went by, with receptionist staff at my side (sometimes not even serving customers) simply ignoring me. I finally got hold of one of the receptionists to try to see where the concierge was and they got hold of somebody. I thought this guy was also a concierge, but it turned out it was just someone they got hold of, he didn't have much of a clue how to help me, but said the concierge would call me by four. Four came and went and I called the ever useful &quot;9&quot; number and asked to be put through to the concierge, long pause again, the receptionist answered and stated that the concierge still was not around, but he would call me in 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later I gave upon getting a phone call and went down to the concierge desk and found him myself. The electricity here also seems to drop out for around 5 seconds, I was sitting in the bath last night and the lights went out. Each time the lights have gone out they have come back on again, but I fear they may not one time. Also a note for all us Americans and Western Europeans who are used to smoking being banned in enclosed public spaces. Word of warning - it is not here, and worse, there is little or no sign-posting to indicate where you can smoke and where you cant. I was having a coffee and a pastry in the coffee area just off reception (where the service was very unresponsive and slow) when I was engulfed in tobacco fumes. This is a pretty horrible experience when you are not used to it. I would not recommend this place, they seem complacent and don't seem to care about their customers. The ITC Sheraton's I have stayed in here have much cleaner rooms and their service standard are excellent. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Grander than we thought We stayed at the Intercontinental Grand New Delhi during January 07.On arrival we got a 5* greeting at the door. This was our first time in Delhi so we had no idea what to expect and having read previous reviews on this hotel was a little daunted that it was part of our package. We loved it. Yes there is building work going on so there is some noise at times. The rooms are being updated to reflect the trend in contemporary décor. The views aren’t great but even if they were the smog is so thick you probably couldn’t enjoy them anyway!We were on floor 18 with views of the railway station and the highway with its constant horn blowing. It was fun watching the local life and the horns are part of the experience, just like in New York but louder, longer and more frequent!In our deluxe room we had a super king bed. The sheets and duvet were wonderful, cool smooth cotton of very high quality. It was really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired so I think this room was awaiting redecoration but it was still clean with mountains of fresh fluffy clean towels. Strangely there was only one robe and one pair of slippers. There was all you could want - shampoo, body lotion, conditioner, soap, shoe shiner, comb, toothbrush kit, shave kit and vanity kit. There was a safe, hairdryer, iron and board, a well stocked reasonably priced mini bar and tea &amp; coffee making facilities. A great little perk was the complimentary provision of 2 litres of mineral water daily. The Delhi news was also delivered daily (printed in English).The food in the hotel was excellent we never had a bad meal any upset tummies.Champions bar was brilliant. A never ending range of international drinks were available and good food. Here superb entertainment was provided by a four piece live band covering some of the best oldies. The drummer does The Eagles &amp; Chris Rear brilliantly and a female singer who could sing Karen Carpenter and Sade. If you weren’t watching you’d have swore they were the real thing - Awesome!Baluchis is the Indian Restaurant. We ate here for one lunch and one dinner during our 3 nights and found it faultless. The service and food was excellent. Tell them what you normally eat back home and they’ll advise on what you might like to order.Rendevous is the international buffet. The choice here was enormous. Ranging from continental, Indian, Chinese &amp; Japanese. The desserts were to die for. Tiny slices and portions so you could have more than one at a time - great to try all the different flavours. Rendevous is also where the buffet breakfast was served; again loads of choice for all nationalities.We didn’t eat at Art Juntion but it is at pool level on the 2nd floor serving snacks such as Nachos, club sandwich etc. There’s a great pool if you get time to use it.Also on Floor 2 is a jeweller. He was very happy to do a deal, very friendly and spoke brilliant English.Taxis and guides are always keen to take you to government shops. These are small malls where Indian handicrafts such as carpets, fabrics, scarves jewellery etc are sold. If you buy carpet, furniture etc the government will pay to send it back home for you. I then later read in ‘rough guide’ that there are fake government shops and whoever takes you there gets commission on your sale so beware if this will bother you.All in all a satisfactory stay was had. The service was good, the rooms were more than comfortable with lots of amenities and the food excellent - what more could you want? "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good hotel My 2-nite hotel stay was good. The staff was very helpful. Food was average. Room was average, but still clean and quiet. It was quite pricey, so I can't say the service or facilities were of equal value. Internet access was over $20US for 24 hours. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Better than expected.... We were concerned about this hotel as a result of TripAdviser reviews but were given reassurances by our booking agent. It was pleasing to find that the hotel in our view provided acceptable, but not wonderful, accommodation in an excellent location for a few days in Delhi. Renovated, minimalist (and upgraded) room was fine with only occasional, minor day time intrusions from the hotel renovation programme. We found the entire reception staff to be most helpful with only one misunderstanding about billing. Room service, especially dealing with minor problems could have been faster and more reliable. Be wary of the inhouse travel service whose drivers like to take you on unexpected shopping expeditions! Excellent breakfast and a Chinese (!) restaurant to remember. Overall, an enjoyable experience in an only slightly faded venue. "
the lalit new delhi ,"delayed checkout i was in this hotel last week ,and can truly say this was a terrible experience,however if you have time on your hands,and dont mind waiting 45 minutes to check out,my collegue waited 1.30 to checkout.this is the place to stay.there are much better hotels than this. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Disappointing service from a global brand The Hotel Intercontinental The Grand in New Delhi in no way lived up to the expectations that we had of either the Intercontinental chain nor any hotel where the rooms cost more than US $300 per night.I was part of a large group staying at the above hotel and also spending considerable amounts on the use of the hotel's conference facilities. We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the accommodation and the level of service received when we raised our concerns.Several members of our group had to request to change rooms because the rooms we were allocated were unsatisfactory: they were dirty, smelled bad or were in generally poor or shabby condition. My own room smelled dreadful and the window did not fit in the frame, meaning a draught came through the gap and I could hear all the traffic noise. We had been offered newly renovated roomsa t the time fo booking, but we had to fight to get them.In general the response from staff was indifferent and not attentive to our concerns the first time they were expressed. I had to call three times to ask to change rooms and was passed to several members of staff and was cut off twice. Even then, I had to wait more than an hour for a resolution, which only came when I went to reception myself to complain. A colleague was offered the opportunity to finally change rooms - at midnight!I appreciate that we are priviledged to be able to stay in such an expensive hotel in a country where there is such abject poverty, but I do not feel that the service justified the price nor that the service relfected that which I would expect of the Intercontinental brand. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Loud hotel with unprofessional personnel! Intercontinental Grand in New Delhi is a huge 25 stories hotel with no soul. They renovated a few rooms on the different floors, they look good, but all the other- old and smelly. Carpets smell so bad, you can't even imagine! And hotel located just next to railway station with trains departing every minute! And next to the main road. As you might know, Indian drivers horn all the time, traffic never stops in Delhi, so it is just inpossible to sleep without strong earplugs. We were in 3 different rooms until we found something quiet. Restaurant is ok, it is safe to eat there. Hotel has an army of personnel, they have a quard on every floor, tonns of concierges and receptionists, and they all want money!!! They grab your bags and then tell you that you should pay them. Unbelievable! "
the lalit new delhi ,"Loved It!! After reading all the reviews, I left London with a heavy heart. The last time I was in Delhi was 6 years ago and we stayed at this hotel and had a great time. But I have to say that the service we received was impeccable. We did stay in the Club rooms, which were pricey but we wanted comfort. The rooms were great. The breakfasts in the morning were superb, the pickups were a great service, and we were very happy. The location is wonderful, and we were able to get around very easily. I would definitely come here again, once we have saved up some money of course!! "
the lalit new delhi ,"Not recommended at all The room was nicely decorated but the bathroom was extremely dusty and there was leftover grime in the sink that looked like it hadn't been wiped in ages. The shower drain and sink drain both clogged up, creating a mini flood in the bathroom. The worst part of our stay however was the awful front desk service They could barely speak English and as a result could not answer many of our basic questions. For example, they were supposed to call us with more information about our tour bus pick up time and place, but never called. When I called down to ask for this information, they kept insisting, &quot;No problem ma'am, we have the contact list so we will take care of it. &quot; I tried asking the same question 10 different ways but gave up after a while. As a result of their incompetence, several people were missing on our bus and our departure was delayed by quite a bit. We also placed a 1-800 call to the US that the hotel operator assured us would be free of charge, but the hotel charged us $70 for the call anyway. We tried speaking to management about this but they refused to drop the charge. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Very Average I was pretty disappointed with this hotel for the money. When you pay over USD300 per night you expect better than dirty, noisy, dated rooms and bad food. The breakfast restaurant was terrible. The staff were fairly unhelpful (although the airport pick up was good) and USD10 per 30 minutes for internet access was not acceptable. It is nowhere near a 5 star hotel, I would have thought the Intercontinental group would have better standards than this. I was disappointed. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Expensive but shabby We just got back from a stay here. Location was pretty good, but the hotel is way too expensive for what you get. We paid $380/night (including a +$40 2nd person fee). As other postings note, hotel is being rennovated and is noisy 24 hours a day. Rooms are drab as are the common areas in the hotel. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Worst hotel ever Just stayed at this hotel for three nights and what a dump. A mausoleum - shabby, old, dated, staid, run-down. The check-in staff are useless - half an-hour to check me out and still errors on the bill. The rooms are old, dated and very dirty. The shower fell to pieces. Don't even think about the restaurant. The bar is dark and dingy and completely void of any atmosphere. The hotel has a pool which is used by pigeons and everthing/one gets pigeon excreta on them. Just don't stay here.................. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Stay somewhere else! Stayed in this hotel while in India for two weeks on business, and it was not a pleasant experience. There are major renovations going on in the hotel, which means that you can expect to be kept awake by the hammering and drilling until well past 11 at night. Complaints to reception won't get you anywhere.Internet connection is available for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 24 hours. You cannot simply ask to be connected for the duration of your stay. Even when you get connected, it is often very slow, or occasionally drops the signal.Everything in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced - a buffet breakfast will set you back 650 rupees. And don't even consider wine with dinner, unless you fancy spending 2750 rupees on the cheapest bottle. (Wine that would be 20 euro max in another hotel - in another country - will set you back 60+ euro here.)The rooms were clean, but drab and dull. In the bathroom, the taps were water-stained, and rusting in places. And from my room at least there was no view to speak of.Hotel staff were generally very friendly - especially in the restaurants. And the food was pretty good.If you are looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights, then this hotel would be fine (but pricey), but any more than that and I would say stay somewhere else. And if you want value for money, you won't find it here. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Get another hotel The hotel is under rebuilding and you will know it at your cost. Hammering, drilling, solvents, painting, etc., don't contribute to an enjoyable stay.I requested to change room because of noise, the next room I was glad that improved, except that next day they started to paint that floor, so it was not very &quot;inspiring&quot;.The same problem one year ago.For the price we can have better options in Delhi.Never again ... "
the lalit new delhi ,"Very disappointing stay! I have just spent a week in the Intercontinental Grand, New Delhi. A very tired and ugly looking hotel. The rooms haven't been refurbished for a long time. There was building work going on 24hours a day in a lift shaft near my room which kept me awake every night. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor has closed down, and on both nights when I went to the other restaurant on the top floor, I found I was the only person dining in there. The swimming pool has a net covering it to keep birds out except a dozen pigeons were trapped inside the netting flying around. The hotel is in a run down area of the city close to a highway and railway station with trains running through 24hours a day sounding their horns as they pass the station which is clearly audible from your room. Very annoying at 4am! Then on the last night, I was woken by maintenance at 00:30am to fix the lock on my door which I hadn't even reported broken!!! And to make matters worse, my airport taxi hadn't been booked and when the porters finally arranged one, the driver didn't know his way to the airport!!! All this, at a cost of over $1000 for 6nights! There are much better hotels in Delhi for cheaper, I wouldn’t even bother considering this hotel! "
the lalit new delhi ,Nothing Special reallly really not worth the money. rooms are ugly/old/ and not clean. don't stay here. don't be fooled by the nice lobby. 
the lalit new delhi ,"great hotel overall We stayed here for 2 nights in mid-December - our first stop on a 2 week trip to India. I had stayed here twice before as a young, single female traveler, and felt very safe/comfortable. This time I was with my husband and it was an equally good experience. Our room was in excellent condition, and since we were recovering from jet lag we spent quite a lot of time there! Room service food was quite good, as was the breakfast buffet. We had arranged to have our train tickets sent to the hotel prior to our arrival in India and the hotel staff gave them to us as soon as we checked in. I do think that the Intercontinental, like most 4-5* hotels in Delhi, is somewhat overpriced, but it's worth it for a couple of nights particularly if you are just entering or about to exit the country. "
the lalit new delhi ,Worst hotel I ever stayed in I wish I could give it a zero instead of one point. This place is absolutely crap. I got billed £500 plus in two days of stay (including food). The room was nothing to write home about - the cushions had stains on them from overuse. The bathroom was absolute rubbish. The service was poor. The staff seemed pretty clueless most of the time. They couldn't arrange a taxi for me and kept me waiting for half an hour. And I had a horrible view of a train platform from my window. Nothing to write home about in terms of views. I will never never stay there again. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Great place to stay We stayed at this hotel in April for 3 night. We had a club room on the 23rd floor. We checked in on the 22nd floor which also has a large lounge where afternoon tea is served to guests as part of the room price. Dainty sandwiches and cakes with a selection of teas are available. Breakfast is sometimes served there as well.Our room was clean and well appointed with a king size bed wing chairs and large corner windows overlooking the city.Although not newly furnished it certainly was not old and tired. Believe me I have stayed a appalling hotels in England at much higher prices than this one with snotty indifferent staff. I found the staff well mannered attentive and ready to help in any way they could. On our last day there we stayed in our room till 3pm. Our plane did not leave till 1 am in the morning. The staff at the desk on the main floor had a whole list of suggestions on how we could spend our time until it was time for the Intercontinental limosine, which was included in the room price, took us to the airport.I read some of the reviews and I cannot relate them to our experience at this hotel. We had a great time there and would certainly stay there again when we go back to India. "
the lalit new delhi ,"solid hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in April as a starting point for a 2 week jaunt through the north of India. I chose this hotel because we wanted something close to Connaught Place and we wanted a good chain. I was under the impression that being near C. P. would be convenient and we could walk there. But really, in retrospect, it's not necessary. You can stay in a hotel that is further away and really not miss any centrality because you can't walk anywhere! It is too dirty and overwhelming so you will wind up in a cab, which cost us $10 for 4 hours and the driver waited for us while went to eat, shop, etc. The hotel is beautiful and our room was great. They upgraded us to a junior suite and the view was stunning. However, all of Delhi smells due to the pollution and this extends into the hotel. I also think that the water they use to mop and in the fountains are really contaminated and smell horrible. But aestetically and service wise the hotel was great. Also, fyi, they charge you some ridiculous luxury tax in Delhi, this is typical of every hotel.We ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner 1 night and didn't find it to be anything to write home about. The bar food on the other hand was yummy! We had the chicken tikka massala and it was delicious. We ate in Zen in C.P. a chinese restaurant and it was excellent also. We went to a restaurant in G-K-I Market when we returned to Delhi, sorry don't remember the name but it's the only one there, and that was the best one.We thought that the hotel was beautiful. We wanted to use the pool but were absolutely exhausted and passed out on the 1st day after sightseeing. which, by the way, we got the cab driver for $25 for the whole day and he took us everywhere. So bargain with the driver when you get in. I hope this helps. I must say that the hotels in India were really expensive given that it is a developing country and how cheap everything else was! Also, we work for an airline and travel a lot just to give you an idea. We also stayed at the Taj Palace when we were returning so you can check out that write-up also. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Decent Hotel not great value New Delhi hotels are expensive and overpriced, that's standard. Lack of competition and a shortage of anything 3*/4* keeps the prices of 5* hotels at a premium. You either go 5* or take a risk with a 2*...which other reviews show can be a very &quot;hit or miss&quot; affair.Intercontinental Grand is in a good location very close to Connaught Place.I stayed in a club room which included breakfast and evening canapes, beer, tea and coffee all day etc.. If you get a good deal it's worth doing for a few dollars extra. Room was fine, bathroom a little tired with a few burn stains in the bath. Service was ok with housekeeping giving you extra complimentary waters for a few rupees tip. Swimming pool was quite good (smallish, but gets the afternoon sun). Only ate in the hotel on my last night before travelling onwards, got &quot;Delhi Belly&quot; after a meal at the hotel's specialist Indian restaurant (which annoyed me intensely).On the whole, a decent hotel but poor value compared to others you might have stayed at. "
the lalit new delhi ,"The not so Grand Despite it not being our first choice but due to late booking we stayed at the intercontinetal thinking that the Intercontinetal name would provide reliability.We had a club suite, the room was old and tired it needed a refirb about 2 years ago. Service at the hotel was very average nothing excpetional. The food also was also nothing to write home about. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Grand is only so - so I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand for 8 days during the beginning of March 06. The hotel was average in general, certainly not up to the standards of what you would expect from InterContinental. They were prompt in picking me up from the airport late at night (an extra $50 charge) and they were always helpful and quick with requests for extra towels, etc. The rooms were dissapointing and I expected more for The $229usd I paid per night. A 12% tax was also added to all room charges but this would have been added to any hotel in the Delhi area. While in Delhi I read several articles in the local paper regarding the severe shortage of hotel rooms in the city. This is probably why they can get away with charging so much and offering so little. The room itself was tired and dated. The fuse for the lights blew when the bedside lamps were turned on the same time the blow dryer (if you could call it that) was on. The carpet was dirty and the shower curtain showed signs of mold growing on it. On the plus side, they did have duvet covers on the bed and not just a sheet and blanket. They did offer wireless internet access although it was a bit pricy ($5 per 30 minutes). The breakfast buffet was good and had several western style dishes available. There was a great pastry shop in the lobby and they brought unlimited complementary bottled water to to the room. The travel desk (run by a different company) located on the second floor was terrible. We bought plane tickets and paid for them only to show up at the airport and learn that they had been canceled by the travel agency and the money refunded to them. There are two very good, although very pricy restraunts on the top floor. The location of the hotel was a plus if you need to be in the center of the downtown. Only a 5 minute walk from Connaught Place and the main downtown area. I was in town for a convention and talked with several people who were staying at other similar hotels in Delhi. The general conclusion is: expect to pay outrageous prices for any 5 star hotel in Delhi and expect to be dissapointed by what you get for the money. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Horrible Hotel I put a group up in this hotel for a few nights this February and all participants hated it. First off, the concierges and check-in staff were rude and impatient, not to mention the fact that we were guaranteed better service if a male did transactions. The gender bias was appalling and embarrassing. Secondly, several people had plumbing or foul odour problems with their rooms, and although we paid for a higher grade of accomodations they simply refused to give them to us as they had overbooked. (Something I later found out, they are notorious for). For the cost of their rooms, they are simply not worth it. Period. Rooms are slightly run down with somewhat shabby bathrooms. They do have lots of shops, restaurant choices, and a beauty salon. Overall, the establishment is overwhelmingly large and comes with all the unfortunate problems usually associated with such a size. You will wait in long cues at the front desk, receive offhand customer service, and eat mediocre food. There really is nothing special about this hotel, so unless you are using its facilities for business, you are better off elsewhere. "
the lalit new delhi ,The worst experience ever We were to stay in the hotel for 8 nights but cut our stay to just one night because:1)There was no heat in the rooms when it was 40F outside.2)The bathrooms had rust on the fixtures.3) The breakfast buffet had some stale and undercooked4) The lobby was dark and lighting was horrible kinda depressing acutally5)people were out to trick you at the business center especially overcharing for the internet service. 
the lalit new delhi ,"Not what you would expect from an Intercontinental Stayed here for 3 nights in May, 2005. The five stars must be because of the impressive lobby 'cause it sure ain't the rooms. After a grueling 24 hour journey in coach from California, checking in at 1 a.m. and only semiconscious and wanting nothing more than to put head to pillow, the clerk was extremely aggressive trying to get me to join the Intercontinental hotel club (or something like that) at some exorbitant membership price. Could have lived without that. As others have stated, the rooms were tired and in need of an overhaul. Windows dirty, bathroom mirror hazed over like you normally see in some 200 year old historic house. I like my hotel rooms on the cold side especially when it is the hottest time of the year in Delhi (110 degrees). Even though I cranked up the temperature as high as it would go, never got more than a cool breeze. It wasn't hot but not nearly as cool as I would have like it. When checking out the last morning of my stay, I requested to leave 1 medium sized bag and my computer with storage until I was due to fly out that night. They said they wouldn't store the computer due to previous guests complaints about damage. I asked them if they really expected me to haul my computer bag around all day while walking through Old Delhi. After a lengthy discussion, we finaly agreed on a compromise, that I would lock my computer in my luggage but this took 20 minutes of needless hassle. On the plus size, the guy who cleaned my room was very nice and provided extra bottles of water as requested (free) and the food and staff in the Woks restaurant was outstanding. Not sure why the place was empty both times I ate there when everything was so good and reasonably priced. The hotel is convenient to Connaught Place and both Old and New Delhi.I reserved way in advance on the Holiday Inn website and got a great rate a bit more than USD100 per night. For that rate, it was serviceable but for a rate of $200-300, you should be able to do much better. "
the lalit new delhi ,"Good choice Won't be the best 5 star that you ever stay in, but it is a good choice for a few days in Delhi. The staff were helpful and the service generally was pretty good. The rooms were a bit dark and could do with some freshening, but they were functional and comfortable. We stayed in a Club Room and found complimentary water, chocolates and cookies waiting for us on our arrival. Breakfast is good. One tip if the main breakfast area is busy, is to go to Woks restaurant on the first floor. Same breakfast, lots of eager waiters, absolutely no other guests ... "
the lalit new delhi ,"overrated hotel Stayed here earlier this month. Hotel is centrally located and has spacious rooms with big beds and some excellent dining options. However, rooms look a bit tired and bathroom, carpet and linen are not very clean. At the time of check-out, the hotel clerk (unjustly) claimed that my travel agent hadn't made full payment for the room and forced me to sign an unspecified check. Since I had only half an hour to catch my train, I had no option. My travel agent has lodged a complaint with the hotel. All in all a bit disappointing for a hotel that charged me 240 dollar a night. "
the lalit new delhi ,"good centrally located hotel This hotel is a good 5* hotel centrally located in the heart of Delhi. While not the &quot;best&quot; 5* in the city, it is not the most expensive either. It has most things that a traveler looks for, including a variety of restaurants (though the service could be stepped up), small shops, business centre, large rooms and courteous staff. Would recommend as far as the big chains go. "

the manor ,"Incredible hotel incredible service incredible food If you are looking for a smaller hotel with amazing customer service and mouthwatering food...The Manor is your place. The staff at the hotel were very attentive and catered to each and every one of our needs. We dined at 'Indian accent' which was one of the best dining experiences of my life. The food was out of this world...so innovative...I would say it is 'Indian food like its never been eaten before'...There is a large area outside the restaurant where you can sit and enjoy good food and fine wine or just unwind with friends. Soft music plays and gentle lighting creating a very relaxing ambience. The rooms were spacy and clean and service was incredible. I would definitely recommend this to others who visit the city. I have stayed at the Sheraton, Taj and Oberoi...and interestingly, I have found that my experience at 'The Manor' was by far the best. "
the manor ,"A quiet oasis in a busy city At the end of your trip through India we treated us with a stay in The Manor.The service, the design, the nice location exceeded what we had expected!We felt at home immediately.The restaurant also needs to be mentioned since the food was really excellent and delicious. "
the manor ,"Unbeatable personalised service exquisite food reasonable rates Everything about our stay at this small boutique hotel exceeded our expectations. The service we received was the best we have ever experienced and it didn't cost the earth. All of the staff were warm, friendly and took a keen interest in ensuring our stay was as enjoyable as possible. Likewise the food was superb (although not cheap). There was a welcome air of tranquility to counter the hustle and bustle of the city and I'd definitely go there again on my next visit to New Delhi. "
the manor ,"a true boutique property The Manor is a &quot;true&quot; boutique hotel! The biggest attraction is the personalized service, a warmth which is so missing in 5 star hotels. It's a small 15 room property, set in a bunglow with nice green lawns. The interiors were very pleasing - contemporary with marigold flowers placed interestingly adding a beautiful Indian touch.The staff were so helpful in getting us all organized for our trip to Jaipur and then Agra. To be honest, it was such a welcome change experiencing true hospitality...and the food was absolutely divine!! The restaurant there is an essential stop for every foodie. We had no idea that Indian food could ever be like this. We would definitely recommend this hotel! "
the manor ,"The facility is a wreck beneath the surface Dont do this unless you have some assurance of change. Hot water and Internet did not work, water from AC was over floor, the foot massage offered is for a mere 15 minutes and the is very expensive. The staff is very kind but they cant fix a bad building. Sparks flew from the electrical outlet when I tried to charge my phone. This place could have ruined my trip if I had let it. Very large construction project right next door which is just beginning. Great location and room size was good. "
the manor ,"Great restaurant in a hidden gem of a hotel! Was visiting friends in Delhi and decided to stay at The Manor as had heard very good things about it. We spent 3 nights there and the experience was truly awesome. We felt we were transported to a private secluded world away from everything. Though the property is not too large with only 15 odd rooms but the comforts can match those in 5 star hotels. The service was perfect, not too intrusive. A special mention of the food in their new restaurant Indian Accent - I have never had such amazing food in India before.it was world class fare and the chef was willing to go out of his way to accommodate my request for light meals on certain days as well.Coming back to the hotel each evening after the hustle bustle of Delhi city was like coming home.... definitely recommended. "
the manor ,"Could not wait to get out of there! Booked a final night of a wonderful trip to Rajasthan in the Manor Hotel - based on positive reviews on T.A. Big mistake! Whilst the service was OK, the rooms were unclean and and made you feel dirty as soon as you walked in. We changed the first room immediately (think stains all over the ripped carpet and furniture, bad smells and dirty bathroom), the second was only marginally better. These were two of their best superior rooms.We had dinner, which was OK, nothing memorable.Overall I would definitely avoid. "
the manor ,"Overall disappointed with manor! I wonder when i read other reviews if i stayed in the same hotel!the hotel is in a quiet safe location,on arrival we were offered coffee,this failed to appear,offered complimentary head and foot massage,by the time the masseuse arrived it was too late.We had rooms 1 and 2,room 1 had a damp smell,hair dryer didn`t work,although reported was never changed.room 2 was dark,and we had lights on at all times,this room was tired!!curtains needed a clean,terrace needed a sweep,fittings in the bathroom need updating!no tea or coffee facilities in rooms.We had to use spray in room as mosquitoes kept appearing.Tried to book for dinner,but it was the night of introducing new menu to local press etc.we could sit outside on terrace,but,yes were told mosquitoes were a problem!they did pay for a taxi to take us to another restaurant.At breakfast we were the only guests,scrambled egg on soggy bread was left.There seemed to be staff training going on everywhere,maybe they should have closed for a few days.Dinner the next evening was excellent,and i believe their new menu will be a great success.the staff are excellent,especially the restaurant manager.An early start the next day with the promise of a packed meal did not appear!Hopefully the hotel will get a make over along with the new menu!would i stay again,probably not. "
the manor ,Congratulations Trip Advisor - Great Hotel Well done trip advisor. Chose this hotel solely on your recommendation and it is great!! Staff genuinely friendly. But the food in the restaurant is wonderful. Really is out of this world. Only staying three nights and then moving on to the &quot;Palace on Wheels&quot; but the Manor would encourage me to return to Delhi. And they also have a travel service to drive you round and see the sights. 
the manor ,"At best an average hotel but great staff Had high expectations of this hotel given its tripadvisor ratings. In fact we also stayed at Amber (rated 2nd) and the Imperial (rated 7) during this trip to Delhi. Although I have never been let down by tripadvisor in the past on this instance I was disappointed. It may have been because it followed an impeccable and faultless stay at the Imperial for only £60 extra a night. The greeting by the staff at the Manor was friendly and efficient but the room which was in an annexe had stains on the carpeting and a gap under the door which let in annoying mosquitos. We had avoided these pesky creatures throughout our trip and were not very happy to deal with them on our last night in India. It was pretty cold in the evening and the a/c did not adequately heat the room either so we were given an electric heater. Not great for 9500 Rs a night plus 22% taxes (10% being for service charges!!). The trains rumbled past, shaking the room every 15-20 mins which interrupted our sleep. Although the bathroom looked the part, the toilet seat was old and kept falling off too. I did ask for a room change but they were fully booked (thanks to tripadvisor reviews most likely!). On the positive side, the staff were really lovely and tried to help best they could and the dinner in the restaurant was very tasty and the breakfast, although limited was very good in quality.I had asked for massages for myself and my husband but they were unable to procure the female masseuse so we just had the complimentary head and foot massage which was excellent.I think our stay would have been better if we had been in the main part of the hotel. Avoid room 15 at all costs!!!The location in South Delhi is a bit far out really and we will most likely be staying at the Imperial again on our next trip. "
the manor ,"Manor Motivates to Visit New Delhi again! We dealt primarily with Manish and must congratulate the Manor on having such a cheerful, informed, efficient and calm staff member. He was an absolute pleasure and deserves praise.My fiancée became sick and the hotel immediately delivered medicine to our room. My airline tickets were in a disarray which affected my room reservation but the hotel was prompt in corresponding with me and subsequently we were upgraded which makes continued patronage 110% definite. I was recognized by staff and in turn recognized that they used to be at the IHC (India Habitat Centre, the literatti centre/hotel of New Delhi). Everyone was polite, well trained and always had a smile. The food was wonderful. The front desk was also able to confirm my airline ticket and did so in an efficient manor. The response times to emails were excellent and a wonderful way to keep business. The things I might work on I sent to the hotel and within two days, not only had they replied, but with detailed answers to my queries. This was at a time when Bombay was in a Volatile situation (Nov 08) but the Manor seemed calm and confident.All in all we would definately recommend this hotel to our friends. It is already enjoying respect and a nice buzz in Delhi and I enjoyed reading about it in Tatler. We hope to stay there soon.Best wishes,Anjhula Singh BaisMedia Personality "
the manor ,"soft landing in Delhi We landed in Delhi at lunchtime and were driven directly through the chaos that is Delhi traffic to this calm setting.We had a suite, (Room 14) although it was more like a superior double, having merely a seating area within the bedroom rather than a separate sitting room. The hotel looks good and the staff was very attentive. The trains can be intrusive, although not enough to disturb sleep. Free broadband internet access downstairs and universal sockets in the room were useful and tea on demand was welcome.Less impressive was the breakfast - if your room rate includes it, it means one food item from the menu, so either cereal or toast; and one drink item, so either coffee or juice. Extra items are charged for. They were also prepared to charge for an early breakfast to be served in the room, but waived this when we protested. Apart from these negatives, this is a lovely hotel in a quiet and safe location of Delhi. We would stay there again. "
the manor ,"the best place to stay at in New Delhi this is an elegant boutique -style hotel (less than 12 rooms i think) in an upmarket suburb of new delhi - about 15-20 minutes drive from Connaught place etcnew delhi is a polluted, crowded and massive sprawl of a citythis place is a peaceful little gem, and far better value than the US$500 minimum expected for the better-known places in Janpath, etcthe staff are knowledgeable and helpful .. ie we didn't get ripped off by taxi drivers nor get lost. Staff recommendations on where to go/eat were spot onthe breakfast terrace is a wonderful start to the day, and being so small, all the other guests feel obliged to say a friendly 'good morning' to you even if you do turn up in your pyjamas with a bad hangover..!if the price range suits - don't bother staying anywhere else "
the manor ,"I miss the Manor already The Manor is a great place to start a trip to India. It is indeed a quiet and relaxing oasis in the big dusty dirty Delhi. All the staff were proffessional and friendly, without being overwhelming. The rooms were very clean with beds big and comfortable. You can choose from western or Indian food, both of which are delicious.As it was our honeymoon they left a chocolate cake in our room and a bath tub full of rose petals- very sweet.The tea and chai are both very good, best served overlooking the lush green lawn. Over all an excellent place to visit. "
the manor ,"Lovely peaceful and clean in an extremely noisy city Fantastic small hotel, rooms very comfortable, staff very helpful and knowledgable, food was superb, we chose an Indian meal with a dessert the waiter recommended and we were extremely happy with his choice. Breakfast on the patio overlooking the lawn was very enjoyable and memorable, enjoyed the wildlife in the garden too. If we go back to Delhi this will be where we will stay again. It was lovely. "
the manor ,"great two night stop great boutique hotel- very comfortable rooms, fluffy white towels and lots of hot water.Restaurant was excellent and staff all very helpfulReally enjoyed returning to the hotel for tea in the garden after the hurley burley of Delhi. "
the manor ,"Excellent hotel We have stayed in many different hotels in different countries, however our stay at The Manor hotel is among our favourites, even though we only stayed there for one night. We had a standard room and it was very nice and fashionably furnished. The hotel is located in a high end, very pleasant and quiet part of central Delhi, surrounded by beautiful villas. The staff was very helpful and professional. They also provide several complimentary services, such as internet. The restaurant serves delicious indian and mediterranean meals. We highly recommend this hotel. "
the manor ,"An oasis amidst chaos We visited Rajasthan in Feb 2008 arriving in New Delhi. Our travel agency used SITA as the organisers for our trip. They were a disaster, however we insisted on staying at The Manor and it was a winner. This is a boutique hotel located about 30 mins from Connaught Place. It is certainly worth the drive. The room was spacious the marble bathroom was spotless and there was a good supply of free bottled water. There is a small library with a selection of novels and photographic books of the region adjacent to a roof deck. They provide free internet access. Downstairs a cozy bar and lovely dining room. You have the option of dining al fresco. The food was superb, we ate in the hotel every night. They have both an Indian and Continental menu to choose from. I love to cook Indian food and I thought the chef was superb. My dream would be to spend a month at The Manor taking cooking lessons from the chef.Add to this the wonderful attentive service and you are in paradise. The hotel arranged a car and delightful driver for us. After we ditched the tour that we had arranged through SITA the staff at the Manor tailored a tour of New Delhi taking in places of interest to locals, which was exactly what we wanted.I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. "
the manor ,"Quiet and refined It isn't easy to find a quiet place in smoky Delhi. This is a special place. You might consider it a boutique hotel or a luxury guest house. Just a few rooms (7 or 8) in a villa built and furnished in pure '60s style surrounded by a beautiful lawn and garden. Rooms are modern but cosy and clean (flat screen tv). Service is very good (sometimes a bit impersonal). The Restaurant serves excellent Indian food (we didn't try Continental, but you can expect it to be as good). Our driver had a few problems in finding it, so the location can be a drawback: about 20 minutes from Connaught Place. But if you don't want to stay in one of those depressing five star towers which look alike all over the world...well, go to the Manor.Masimo &amp; Marina "
the manor ,"Good Choice for One Night Another Delhi hotel where our pre-arranged (and re-confirmed) transfer didn't show up at the airport (although the hotel claimed that someone was there waiting for us). We took a pre-paid taxi, again easy and inexpensive to arrange, but again, the taxi driver could not find the location. He was able to locate Friends Colony West (be sure to say West), but not the actual street. We had to call on the kindness of strangers, and then to call the hotel itself, before we could actually find the location. This is an attractive property, with a nice bar and restaurant (reasonable and plentiful food), free computer access, lending library, and some green open space to walk around outside. The rooms were on the smallish side, but we had just booked a basic room, nothing more. Large and well-equipped bathrooms, with hairdryers and some toiletries. Flat screen TV with DVD player, which we were unable to get to work. Lots of instructions which we followed to the letter, but without success. We were unable to use the free wi-fi access in our room, either. So I would have to say that compared with the Hotel Palace Heights, this was a bit overpriced (about $250 per night). Still a fine, reasonable choice in Delhi, and with the ability to walk outside on the hotel property, perhaps a better choice if one is spending multiple nights. Did not partake of the (included) breakfast due to an early departure, but there was a complimentary fruit plate, chocolates, and bottled water in our room. "
the manor ,"Loved it. Overall and Excellent Experience I was in India, New Delhi for a conference (Microbicides 2008) from February 23rd to February 29th. I chose to stay at the Manor after TripAdvisor members completely panned the hotel (that shall remain nameless) that the conference recommended. I loved it. Overall an excellent experience.1. COSTCosts were comparable and often better than bigger hotels. I liked the space more than I liked the other hotels my colleagues used.2. FOODBreakfast on the veranda every morning. The complimentary breakfast was exquisite. Of course you had the usual continental breakfast offered, as well as Indian style breakfasts. I didn’t go to India to have eggs on toast so I ran through all the breakfast curries (#1 choose a curry, #2 ask how to eat it). The tea reminded me what crap we get in bags in the West. In fact, I’d told them how much I loved the tea and they mailed me a bag.3. SERVICELoved the individualized attention – an easier challenge for a smaller hotel I imagine, but not one to be taken for granted. I felt like a house guest. Also, for a relatively minor additional daily cost, I had the use of a driver and a car. The Manor has its own cars, and let me tell you, having someone to take me back and forth to the conference, shopping, and on tours, was indispensable. BTW, for free the Manor will pick you up and drop you off from and at the airport.4. ARCHITECTUREI enjoy houses and architecture, and the Manor’s design is what drew me to it at first. I describe it as your typical warm-weather, upper class, British-influenced, colonial style. The pictures I took actually look like the pictures in their brochure – The Manor actually lived up to its billing. How often can one say that? Usually the photos the business takes are in the very best light. In this case the Manor did not need to struggle with that. 5. SHORTCOMINGSThis was not a problem for me, but maybe if you’re sensitive to sound it might be. My room, #5, shared a wall with the kitchen so I could hear early morning kitchen activity. It worked for me because I find that on business trips, the dead quite of a hotel room deprives me of sleep. Sounds of life help me feel more relaxed. Of course in the grand scheme of things New Delhi is NOT quiet. However, Friends Colony West, is one of those upper class enclaves, so it’s a stillness in the middle of Delhi chaos. CONCLUSIONSLoved it. Will happily stay there again if I ever return to New Delhi (I hope I do, I loved New Delhi). Next time maybe I’ll try to afford the penthouse! "
the manor ,Best hotel in Delhi by miles This was an oasis in the hectic buzz of Delhi. The standard room we had was very comfortable and clean though quite compact. Lovely shower. However it was the service here that was so spectacular. The staff went above and beyond to assist us and were so polite and helpful. The food was also great. We have been to India several times and stayed in many hotels. This was one of our best experiences and definitely the best hotel in Delhi in our opinion. 
the manor ,Loved the manor We booked the manor after reading other reviews. The Hotel lived up to all our expectations. Lovely Gardens in calm atmosphere. Food excellent Serving Indian and European cuisine. Staff go out of there way to be helpfull. The guest rooms are all wonderful. Contemporary spotless large rooms fresh flowers fruit and soft drinks all complimentary. The only down side is there is no where to walk out to. Gated residential area. However after a busy day in Delhi do you want to go out wandering at night. Very Highly reccomended. Ann and Mick U.K. 
the manor ,Excellent!!!!!! On our 2nd trip to India Delhi was our first stop. Our plane arrived late at night and we were met by the hotel at the airport. The staff were wonderful and the room was very comfortable. Breakfast was included and made to order. The hotel is small and quiet. A nice transition to India. The only negative is the location is in South Delhi and we needed to take cabs everywhere.I recommend this hotel and would stay there again. 
the manor ,"Great Value for Money I have been travelling to India quite often during the last couple of years and have stayed in most of the major hotels. However, hotel rates in Delhi seem to have gone through the roof so I decided to search for an alternative. Having read the reviews about the Manor, I decided to give it a shot. Although it was pricey, it was great value compared to what I wasbeing offered at other major hotels. I very much enjoyed every bit of my stay at the Manor. From the airport transfer, which is included in the room rate, to the delicious lunch I ate in the beautiful garden, I was very impressed with the personalized service. The staff was very helpful in giving me several valuable suggestions on tourist attractions, places to shop etc. They went out of their way to help me get what I wanted - for instance I wanted to buy pashmina shawls but was short on time so theyarranged for someone to bring his collection to the hotel. I most enjoyed the quiet intimacy of the hotel which is unique to the Manor and definitely worth a premium given the hectic hustle bustle in delhi. The rooms have a modern décor, come with LCD TVs and really good shampoo and conditioner inthe bathrooms. Am definitely coming back!! Loved it. "
the manor ,"Very beautiful Nice Hotel but a bit Pricey This is a really nice hotel in a quiet exclusive neighborhood. I liked everything about it but it's overpriced compared to some of the other places we stayed that had amazing buffet breakfasts etc, (yet cheaper price). But if you want to spend a bit extra to stay in a very Zen-like boutique hotel, then go for it. . "
the manor ,"Ok hotel could be better My wife and I stayed at the Manor for a total of three nights in November 2007. The pickup from the international airport upon arrival was excellent even though it was quite late in the night. The checkin in the hotel was smooth. The front desk staff was helpful all throughout our stay. The hotel was generally nice but we did not like the lighting as it was quite dark all through the hotel . The windows in the rooms also did not offer any decent view or privacy (the drapes had to be kept shut) and faced an adjacent wall or the courtyard. Also, the furniture and the finish in the room looked tired, and requires some renovation. The toilet in the bathroom had visible marks of being worn out, definitely not to the expected quality for the amount that you are paying. The hotel breakfast was complementary and quite nice. However we found the service to be inconsistent. One day we were served very attentively. Another day, the coffee not only took a long time but was terrible, and we were given the bread assortment only when we asked for it later. The dinner was actually delicious and we recommend it highly. However, on one occasion we did find ants on the table cloth and had to move tables. "
the manor ,"Good stay but overpriced The Manor is a small, family-owned (as of recently) hotel. The staff is attentive and helpful, the property is well manicured and clean, the restaurant food is good and the room is clean and comfortable. My only regret was, honestly, the expense. I don't know why the average price here is listed as &quot;$115&quot; since I paid $440 for a suite. I have spent less money on far more luxurious rooms in places like Las Vegas and California. The TV in the room was tiny (again, you'd expect a large flat-screen for the expense). Take advantage of the car and driver that Devika Singh can arrange for you. I would come back to this property in a heartbeat if not for the price. I don't mind spending more to get more, but on the value scale The Manor falls a smidgen short. "
the manor ,Overpriced - it's not worthing The hotel is located in a smart place of Delhi. The garden of the property is nice but that's as far as it goes. My room was confortable but 2 lights were out of service when I arrived.Nice shower in marble but bottles in glass in the shower containing body products. Restaurant correct but full of mosquitos by night.Breakfast average.Staff underskilled compared with he other hotels of Delhi.Avoid the travel desk of hotel which takes high commissions (50% of the railways ticket price!!!).500€ for 2 nights in a standard room. Go to another 5 star hotel. Definitively. 
the manor ,"Over-priced noisy and to be avoided at all costs We booked a three night stay at The Manor after reading other positive reviews on Trip Advisor, but were bitterly disappointed with the reality of the hotel.Whilst the staff were very helpful, our room (number 5) was extremely small and dated, had views out onto a brick wall, suffered from non-stop noise of inefficient and non-working air conditioning, and constant loud reverberation in the water pipes which penetrated throughout the room. In addition, our room appeared to back on to a major railway line, and we were therefore woken up througout the night by the horns of frequent freight trains.We asked to change rooms, but were told that the hotel was full. However, there was no evidence of this at all as no more than 2 other tables were ever occupied in the dinning room at breakfast or dinner. "
the manor ,"Favourite hotel in Delhi As a frequent traveller to Delhi I have experienced the best hotels the city supposedly has to offer (Oberoi, both Taj's, Nikko, Hyatt, Imperial etc...) and the Manor is without doubt 'the' place to stay in my opinion. The property is small, which facilitates a nice personal touch. Rooms are fairly spacious with marble-laden bathrooms. For the price of a basic room at the Oberoi you can get a whole suite here, which is twice the size of the Oberoi room I had. As a food lover the restaurant is a big draw, even if there is only one. Even if you don't stay here I would recommend a visit to the restaurant, which serves the finest Indian food I've personally tasted (as an Englishman that's quite a lot given our nations addiction to Indian cuisine). Service throughout the hotel is attentive and professional. I'm very picky when it comes to service as my other hotel reviews testify but the Manor scores top marks here. What overwhelmingly sold me on the Manor is the setting, which genuinely provides an oasis of tranquillity in the 'heart' of the bustling city that is Delhi. The only negative is the hotels popularity. I had to check out for one day in the middle of my stay because it was fully booked (this was flagged at the time of my booking so no gripes with hotel for this). Would highly recommend. "
the manor ,"Nice hotel but hugely overpriced This is a stylish little hotel set in beautiful grounds. Rooms are modern, comfortable and spotless. The staff are charming and helpful, and more than make up for the polish of a big hotel. The restaurant serves good food, and breakfast outside on the lawns is a great way to start the day.The location works both ways: you're a little far out of the city centre (especially given Delhi's terrible traffic); but that makes the location a little more peaceful and besides, it's cheap to get around and the hotel can organise cars.BUT the real problem here is the price. My double room was quoted at $175 a night. But by the time the hotel had added 10% service, 12% luxury tax and - here's the issue - converted the bill into Rupees at a laughably-bad exchange rate (then converted back into dollars by my credit card company), I ended up paying $280 a night. For that, I could have stayed at the Oberoi...My advice is, give this place a miss. "
the manor ,"Poor reponse leading to failed booking. Front of office response entirely inadequate for prices.I sent an enquiry for availables room by email via the hotel website, and got an automated response. A couple of hours later, the Front office emailed availability and prices - perfect, I thought, and responded that I would like to book, how do it do it. No reponse by email. I phoned, was told they had my email, and would reply soon. I was also told I couldn't book the room by Amex over the phone. 24 hours later and no response.Another email, still nothing. I called again, and was told they would get back to me shortly.An email did arrive eventually 48 Hrs after my enquiry - Sorry sir, we don't now have the availability you wanted.Fantastic. Im staying elsewhere. "
the manor ,"Not for business I am in Delhi 3-4 times a year and thought I'd try the Manor since it had gotten such rave reviews. I got the last room in the house with windows that backed on to a wall. Certainly nothing to write home about. The room was clean, but the hotel interiors could stand a serious refresh- particularly at the rates (USD200+) charged.As for business travellers, the basics (converter plugs, iron) took several calls to arrive. The front desk staff sluggish. The manager never arrived before I left for appointments in the morning. My favorite moment was trying to get back into Friends Colony at 8.30pm one night. They forgot to tell my driver that the nearby gate was closed at night and it took 20 minutes to find an alternative route in. The restaurant does serve good, simple continental cuisine.Rates at the Imperial are often similar -a much better choice. "
the manor ,"The Manor manner - A perfect antidote to hectic Delhi The only, and I mean only, downside to this hotel is its location, but that is no reason not to stay. Most places in Delhi are 15-20mins away in a car, so why not spend an extra ten to experience the tranquility of The Manor.The hotel is in Friends Colony, a quiet area just off a main thoroughfare in southern New Delhi, which houses some of the smaller embassies and consulates and a rather posh (from the outside at least) country club.On arrival, the smart brass gates open to reveal the stylish exterior of the property, and you are welcomed by friendly and efficient staff in the tastefully decorated lobby. After the check-in formalitiesare complete, you are ushered to your perfectly air-conditioned and reasonably spacious room. Ours was finished with dark woods and stone, and had a very comfortable and large double bed.Fruit, flowers, and newspapers appear in the room during the course of the day, but the staff are never obtrusive. The restaurant is a delight, with the interior decor trumped only by the food, which is exquisite. As other reviews observe, this may well be the best Indian food you taste in your entire trip. Do sip a cocktail or two in the Onyx Bar and take tea on the veranda!We highly recommend The Manor for its visual and culinary taste, and for the staff, who understand exactly what the busy, discerning tourist requires - rest and good food in a tranquil, stylish environment. This hotel is a treat not to be missed.Andy Mc (a one-time visitor to The Manor) "
the manor ,"Great experience huge help booking my rajastan itinerary!!! I used the Manor as my homebase from Oct 19 - while traveling to Bhutan, Katmandu, Uttar Pradesh and Rajastan. I had 4 stays altogether and was well taken care of each time. This is a small 15 room family owned and operated hotel in a quiet family style neighborhood just minutes from the insanity of Delhi. The rooms are quiet, clean and very comfortable, there is a restaurant onsite if you are too pooped to venture out. I was able to store luggage and clothing between forays safely. At one point I had forgotten my printouts from guidebooks in storage and they retrieved it and sent it by courier to my hotel in Katmandu. I left my camera on the Palace on Wheels train and they sent a driver to retrieve it. They took care of me in my jet laggidness from start to finish and put up with me when I was cranky and demanding. The very best however, was Devika at Uniglobe travel which is connected to the hotel. As competant as I like to think I am with organizing independent travel, she helped put together trains planes and accomodations where I was at a loss to find info on the internet on times, distances or flat out how to get from one place to another. I cannot thank her enough for suggesting a car and driver for the final 10 days of my trip to really explore the areas not frequented by tourists....this is what made my trip to India more than great, it was a memory of a lifetime! There is no other place to stay in Delhi than the Manor.....I only wish I could be there with you and relive the memories again and again. "
the manor ,"Lovely albeit brief stay at the Manor I checked into a suite at the Manor for about 4-5 hours after a flight from Jaipur while awaiting an overseas flight to Canada. The hotel is substantially farther from the airport than other properties my travel agent recommended (i.e. 30 minutes' drive absent any traffic), but I was willing to forego an extra hour's sleep in order to view the property.I was greeted warmly on check-in by the owner, who made sure I checked in quickly, some tea, and had a bite to eat before catching some sleep. The manager was able to deliver a meal to my bedroom in under 15 minutes from the time I ordered, and was true to his word that I would be awakened in time for my flight. The suite was reasonably-sized, with high ceilings and a compact, but comfortable marble bathroom with separate tub and shower. The water pressure was good.Bed was comfortable with high thread-count sheets and soft pillows. There was a large desk and a small, dated cathode-ray tube-type television, a small chair and loveseat, and a huge window.I was exhausted on arrival, but the area and the hotel itself was quiet and I had no problems at all with noise. I did not try the restaurant, but the room service was prompt and the manager was very keen to please.When I travel, I prefer to stay in smaller, owner-run properties as opposed to large chain hotels. If you are merely seeking a bed between flights in Delhi, there are plenty of options closer to the airport. However, if you are looking for a respite from the noise of Delhi and more personal service, I would highly recomment the Manor - I will stay there again when I next pass through Delhi. "
the manor ,"Not quite right but great restaurant. This hotel is located in a nice part of the city but a long way from anywhere, so don't expect to go out without a taxi. The room was nice but not huge. Strangely there was nowhere to put any suitcases and only one bedside table because of the space. As a result we had to find space on the floor for the two cases which was no that easy. A railway track runs close by. We were on the other side but it was noticeable even there. The best thing by far was the restaurant. Easily the best food we had in our Indian stay, it was superb. They offer a European or Indian menu (we had Indian both nights). It was beautifully presented and excellent quality. The chef was trying some new dishes the second night and personally came to make sure it was OK for us. The staff were attentive and the property itself is clean and set in a nice garden. Its just a shame about the room and the remote location. "
the manor ,Home from Home Worthy holder of the Trip Advisor No.1 Rated Hotel in DelhiOn arrival we were told to make the hotel our home during our stay.The hotel certainly did!!They were even gracious enough to let us camp out at the hotel during an overlay midway thru our trip (including train and airport collection and drop off :) We'll be back :)J 
the manor ,A Hotel of Class We stayed here for 1 nights at the end of our tour of India. The hotel lived up to its reviews. The only one down side was the noise of the Trains at night. So make sure you have a room on the other side to the track. Also room 11 is next to the Air Conditioning System so some noise. They did however on request move us giving us a free upgrade room. It is a Hotel of Class.Only wish it had been a bit less noise at night. 
the manor ,"A calm quiet boutique hotel The Manor was a charming, friendly and quiet hotel in the Friends Colony West, about 25 minutes from Khan Market and 40 mins from Connaught Place. The staff were really helpful. The cost of pick up and drop off at the airport were included in the price. The hotel is run by the owner Mr Singh, who made a real effort to come and chat to all of the guests and make sure that we had everything we needed, and to offer information on places to go and things to see in Delhi. We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday in India and for 2 nights at the end, the first part in a room and the second in a suite. The suite was so much quieter and a nice size. The room was acceptable but ours was located next to the kitchen so there was some coming and going outside.The bar and restaurant were nice, although if you sit outside watch out for the mozzies, I got bitten all over on the first night. The chef was great, the food was lovely. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Delhi. "
the manor ,"Hated the Manor Horrendous experience. Booked the hotel after reading rave reviews from other travelers who stayed there. Started off with the room being not ready for check in inspite of our delayed arrival. Crew was still vaccuming the room when we got there. Once inside the room, the air conditioning was not cooling at all inspite of the thermostat being set to the lowest level. Mosquitoes behind the curtains and baby spiders everywhere from closets to the bathroom. Called the front desk to see whats going on. Nobody responded to the call. So walked out there and finally someone came to our room an hour later. AC still not functioning in 90 degree heat!!! The bathrooms were a sorry state from years of use(read abuse). Strange smell came from the room and the lobby at all times. Asked them to put a room freshner which was finally put on the day we were checking out!!! All in all a horrendous experience! At their price ($420 per night) one can easily stay in a 5 star hotel in delhi if you book in good time. Will not recommend this hotel at all and will surely never go back there again!!! "
the manor ,"Booking problems After having read the good reviews of The Manor, I tried to book a room for February. I sent a booking request by their website. After a few days I didn't get any reaction at all. I sent them an e-mail as a reminder, but no answer again. After having sent another e-mail without response I decided to call them by telephone. They told me that they didn't get the e-mails and asked me if I could send a new one. I asked them if I could fax them instead, because I didn't believe they would receive it now. By the way, they told me that there was vacancy for all room categories.Finally I got a fax back with the answer that all standard rooms had been booked out..........After all of this I decided to book another hotel. "
the manor ,"Peace in India This was the one decent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference. Very cool place, peaceful and stylish. Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid. Its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for. Good food in the restaurant and v helpful staff all round. Location is not great but worth the extra 15 mins journey. Overall top quality. "
the manor ,"Very good value We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of October. The staff were courteous, obliging and quietly efficient. The suite was large, clean and quiet. We ate in the restaurant for one evening meal and although the quality was very good it was inclined to be a little costly for Delhi. We'd recommend the Galati, not that far away and it's in the guide books, where we had an excellent buffet lunch, including soft drinks, for less than 800R for the two of us. The hotel is to the south of the city, some distance away from some of the more notable sites, but this hardly made any difference as having a car and driver is probably the most efficient way to get around in India in any case. I'd have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again. We also stayed one night in the Oberoi Maidens which proved to be a huge disappointment so for us it would be the Manor every time. "
the manor ,"The only place I hope I ever stay in Delhi. The Manor overall is a fantastic place to stay.Delhi was our first stop in India, and we really needed the haven of tranquility that the Manor provides while we tried to adjust.The rooms and bathrooms are great (and clean of course) and very stylish, though perhaps a tad dark. But that's not too much of an issue as there are plenty of places to sit round the hotel. e.g. on the loungers on the deck, or the lawn where they will happily place loungers for you. The train noise did not bother us but perhaps we were on the right side of the hotel.The food is excellent and the restaurant beautiful and quiet, and you can indulge in fresh raw vegetables without a second thought as they are grown by the Manor itself.The staff are ridiculously helpful and will help you with anything that they possibly can.Other services and features: There's a computer and desk provided in the passage area and the internet connection is good. The laundry service was also good and we had no problems with anything we got back, and thought that we probably could have trusted it with more than we did.We had a slight problem with the pick up from the airport and had to wait around for a while, but as far as I can remember it came out that there wasn't a fault on the part of the hotel, and in any case the welcome we received when we arrived made up for the waiting. If I ever return to Delhi I hope I wouldn't want to stay anywhere other than the Manor. "
the manor ,"What a perfect little hotel I stayed at The Manor on my arrival in India, and then again after a five-day trip through Agra and Jaipur, before my onward flight to Mumbai.Out of the nine places I stayed at in India, The Manor was in the top two by far (the top position is shared by Malabar House in Fort Cochin).What a gorgeous little place. It really is small - only 11 to 16 rooms (depending on who you ask!). But there is a great sense of space and light. Both of my rooms were airy, stylish and extremely comfortable, and the terraces, croquet lawn and public areas all add to the sense of spaciousness.Because it is so small, there is a very real sense of personal attention. One example is breakfast. On one morning I wanted to have breakfast (included in the room rate) really late, closer to lunchtime, at around 12h30. Expecting a great deal of resistance - most hotels maintain strict &quot;breakfast hours&quot; - I arrived in the restaurant to find it was not a problem at all. They just served a gorgeous breakfast of croissants and soft scrambled egg and fresh sweet lime juice and great coffee, no problem whatsoever.On the other two mornings I asked to have breakfast served in my room. Once again, no problem at all, no extra charge for the brilliant and quick room service. Now many, many top hotels around the world insist that a complimentary breakfast must be taken in a restaurant, but The Manor is small and friendly enough not to have such archaic rules.I was also pleased to have free internet access in my room. A minor gripe is that it is LAN based rather than wireless, but it's free and fast, unlike other &quot;top-notch&quot; hotels I stayed at in India, such as the Taj Mahal in Mumbai where internet access, like everything else, just costs too much.And for those guests who don't travel with laptops, there is also a PC available for internet access. Nice.Another major plus is the complimentary drive from the airport. I must say, this was one of the main initial selling points of The Manor for me. You don't want to arrive in Delhi at 3am and still have to find transport to your hotel, so being met by a driver in the early hours of the morning was just bliss.I have two very small problems with The Manor. One is that it isn't very conveniently located - it's about a 150 rupee taxi ride to Connaught Place, for example. But the flipside of that is that it really is located in a calm, tree-lined suburb totally secluded from the madness of Delhi.The other tiny gripe is that I was charged extra for mushrooms and tomato with breakfast on only one of my three mornings! I know that is truly petty, but when they get everything else SO right, it's a pity to spoil it with inconsistency. Either charge me every time, or not at all, but not randomly.To the very dapper Mr Singh who came to offer me a National Geographic to read while I was taking tea on the terrace, I say keep it up, that's a very good little establishment you have there. May it get the visitors it deserves. "
the manor ,"A wonderful stay After reading many of the reviews on this site, we decided to book the Manor during the last part of our stay in Delhi. We stayed at the Hyatt for two nights and then the Manor for four nights. I can't begin to express what a pleasant stay we had at the Manor. The rooms are nice, the food is outstanding and the service was incredible. Our driver, Jaga, was a wonderful guide and made us feel very safe in a city that can be overwhelming for the first time. The owner came and talked to us at dinner and is a very nice man and he even helped us in our purchase of a carpet. This hotel does not have the ammenities of other larger more expensive hotels, but it more than makes up for it in service and serenity. "
the manor ,"design hotel nice and relaxing The manor hotel is placed in a very quite residential part of delhi.It is in a quite place, no cars, no traffic, just beautiful and exclusive villas around.the hotel is a &quot;design hotel&quot;, very beautiful. I suggest a &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;executive&quot; room beacause it is bigger than the others. comfortable and big bed, clean bathroom. the only bad aspect of this hotel is the carpet in the room, it looks old and dirty even if it isn't dirty but I think it is very dated!The room service is good!the breakfast hall is relaxing,we were alone.The staff is very polite. good aspect: internet place is avalibale 24 hours and is free. "
the manor ,"Pefect finish for our holiday in India We stayed 4 nights in August 2007. Had suite number 1, with an extra bed for our 14 year old daughter. Cost us 175 USD + 50 USD for the extra bed. Lovely room, lovely bathroom, lovely hotel, lovely restaurant...we took most meals at the hotel : awsome food, good complimentary continental breakfast (croissants, scrambled eggs on toast, sweetlime juice...). Friendly bar (played cards, read...). Great garden, terrace...Swimming pool in club nearby. Free internet. Super helpful and friendly staff. Arranged everything for us : car to aiport (complementary), taxis, henne... Quiet, comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. Offered us cakes, fruits, chocolate at night... It was exactly what we needed after 15 tiring days in Northern India. We hioghly recommend this hotel ! "
the manor ,"An oasis of tranquility amidst urban insanity Delhi from arrival at the dingy airport to the insane traffic was nerve wracking, so the contrast when we finally made it to The Manor (tucked away in an exclusive enclave in south-east Delhi) was all the more extreme- a security guard to keep out the riff-raff, quiet, friendly front desk staff who did all the form-filling for you while you relaxed and recovered, a large glass of freshly-squeezed mango juice, then a long bath with all the amenities supplied. I wasn't surprised to learn later on that this property is managed by Aman resorts. Complaints- the standard rooms are small, and not the same size; ask to be shown the rooms before deciding. Everything else was fantastic- the service, the food (the angel hair pasta- excellent!)... our travel agent messed up the return airport transfer, but the staff at the Manor took care of everything with aplomb. Suggestions for improvement? Perhaps WiFi access, and some attention to ageing fittings. Other than that, I know for certain which hotel I'll be returning to, when I next visit Delhi... "
the manor ,"Great stay but not the ultimate We stayed at The Manor for 3 nights and must say that the hotel itself is great. One must give credit to the small boutique size of the property which makes it really something amongst the big hotel chains in Delhi.Service was outstanding, from the pick up at the trainstation to the reception and all the staff we interacted with during our stay. Very curteous, friendly, helpful and discreet if needed. On the downside however I did miss a Guest Directory in the rooms, which I regard as a very useful tool for every guest in a foreign city. And it would pay off to train the staff remembering names and whether the guest like coffee or tea to avoid being asked every morning. Additionally, the carpets look very tired and need changing. tiled or wooden floor is easier to keep clean. They have a wonderful lawn and roof terrace which is hardly used (understand that the temperature was not really inviting for a lunch at 45C outside this time of the year), but the umbrella looked really shabby, and the chairs were always left were the guest had placed them a few days earlier. The material on the seats was dirty. the roof terrace is awesome but not inviting since in the evening no one placed candles or some sort of lights. we had to put our own cushions there... Check out was very efficient and the drop to the airport impeccable.Overall, the hotel is good and definitely worth to stay there if you happen to be in Delhi. "
the manor ,"Luxury The Manor is lovely. From being picked-up in a lovely, large air conditioned car and being offered hand-wash towels and drinks enroute to the hotel... then to the room, to the restaurant, and to the time we left... it was all lovely. We had stayed at a few dives throughout our trip and were disappointed but not by The Manor. Service and staff were great. Room's were of an interesting and modern design and we slept in the most comfortable beds we had the whole time (barring Agra Sheraton - which also had lovely beds!) We also hired the hotel's driver &amp; car for a few hours for some sight-seeing around Delhi and were pleased with the service. Restaurant food was also great and a nice change to have something continental-ish rather then pure Indian. "
the manor ,"Feeling Cosseted We stayed at The Manor for two nights at the beginning of our honeymoon trip to India at the end of March 2007.It was a very welcome oasis of excellent customer service ,beautifuly designed surroundings and great food!The bed was exceptionaly comfortable and everything we needed was carried out promptly,faultlessly and without cutting corners.Not at all something which can be said for most hotels we have stayed in in this price range!Our decision to stay here was based on reading other traveller reviews so now we will certainly consult this site before planning other holidays.We liked The Manor so much that we asked our driver(superbly organised along with hotel bookings etc for the duration of our trip by Rajputana Holiday Makers in Jaipura)to make a detour on our way from Agra to the airport just so we could eat there before our flight.We definitely recommend this hotel. "
the manor ,"A great base to call home in India The Manor was apparently India's first boutique hotel when it opened in 1999. And while it looks like its now in need of its first facelift since 1999, it generously ticks the principal boxes of a great boutique hotel - exclusive, intimate experience and fantastically personal service. The Manor essentially became the base camp on our trip - we started off there pre-Rajasthan, returned pre-Varanasi and returned finally from Kerala prior to our London return. In this role it excelled - the team couldn't have been more helpful in organising drivers, confirming train and plane times, holding onto excess luggage we didn't want to lug around, and catering packed meals for us to take on our journeys with us. Always a warm welcome, The Manor is a green oasis of tranquility in the madness of Delhi. There is a subtly colonial air about it, but it's contemporary and efficient. The food is excellent - we particularly liked the authentic Indian food on the menu. The bedrooms and large, the beds excellent, the bathrooms wall-to-wall marble. Couldn't recommend a better place to stay in Delhi. "
the manor ,"Not bad at all but have seen better We stayed at The Manor last September. It seems to have gotten quite good reviews from a lot of people but I wasn't all that much impressed, although I have to admit it is an overall pleasant hotel. It may have to do with the fact that we had stayed at the glorious and impeccable Devi Garh in Udaipur previously before arriving at The Manor. Our room at the Manor was quite small, and rather dark. (It was the cheapest room.) Not much of a view. Found a couple of stains on the wall and carpet, though not so obvious. The bathroom looked a bit tired. There was no bathtub, and the shower room was a bit small. However the garden was spacious and beautifully kept. Food was a bit costly but tasted good. They have two adorable dogs who are friendly. I liked the neighborhood as well. It is in a high-class residential district which is peaceful and calm. The staff are efficient and helpful. The Manager was a very nice person.Their limousine services are very expensive compared to the usual taxis which you can catch on the streets. However pick-ups to and from the airport were free, and they provide a fancy black car with a good-looking chauffer. They gave us mineral water and allowed us to pick our favorite CD on the way.Overall hotels in Delhi are overpriced. Our personal advice is that you to leave Delhi quickly and go off to the beautiful and colorful Rajasthan area. "
the manor ,"Peaceful oasis in Delhi Date: Dec. 9th-13thReviewer: Christina and UddyWe had a lovely stay at The Manor. From the moment we arrived, which was 2:30 a.m. as a result of a delayed flight, the staff were so warm and friendly. They immediately offered us what turned out to be the best tasting chamomile tea. We think about it still. The rooms, while a bit worn around the edges, are clean and beautifully designed with all the modern amenities and great sheets. We were even offered a free upgrade during our stay. Breakfast on the lawn was splendid--food and ambience perfect. It was hard to believe that the chaos of Delhi was just a few kilometers away. While our friends in Delhi thought we were a bit out of the way as far as sightseeing goes, they certainly praised the beauty and peace which abound at this tiny oasis within Delhi. "
the manor ,"An oasis in Delhi's chaos My wife and I stayed here for five nights the end of January while on vacation in Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. We had rented a car and a driver from Rajputana Holiday Makers (first class rental company in Jaipur) and drove around the three cities starting and finishing in Delhi. In Agra we stayed at the Hilton and in Jaipur at the Alsisar Haveli.The Manor is like a nice big family house. The building is surrounded by a good sized family garden in the New Friends Colony just fifteen minutes from India Gate by taxi or auto-rickshaw. The suites are comfortable and well designed, while the standard rooms could be a little bigger. The restauarant is excellent. The dining room overlooks the sunlit garden. Breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at the bar are very good being much better that the stuffy overpriced fare at the Oberoi and other big hotels.Staff are really helpfull and the manager surprised us with a generous practical spirit that I have seldom seen in any hotel.After a day on the road or sightseeing in Delhi this is a true haven. Both of us give top marks to the hotel although there were some small drawbacks, but in Delhi you have to accept that the noise from traffic and railways pierces the walls and windows at odd times during the night. Amanresorts manages the hotel with a high standard of professionalism. We understood that they will be moving to a new hotel in Delhi in a few months and that a new hotel operator will take over. This will result in a renovation of the building and the rooms, the need for which is beginning to show.We would make a strong recommendation to stay here in this quite, well run small hotel. "
the manor ,"The Manor Excellent Choice We had an excellent experience here at the end of our two week stay in India. Found the hotel through the internet. The staff was wonderful and assisted us (3 couples) in every way through our last day with a driver (meeting us a the train station) and shopping and to the airport and mailing boxes back to the US following a wedding. The rooms were clean and crisp and constantly maintained every time we left. The food was wonderful, from lunch one day to breakfast. The atmosphere was peaceful with no disturbances for sleep. Having stayed at a larger hotel at the beginning of our stay in India, this place was totally different and catered to our individual needs. The three couples felt that we were in a family environment. We loved being at the Manor and recomment it to anyone going to Delhi. "
the manor ,"A Gem There is not much that I can add to the other positive reviews of the Manor posted on TripAdvisor except to say that they are all true-- the Manor is as wonderful as everyone says it is.Design, comfort, service, food-- the Manor has it all. The small size of the hotel (12 rooms) makes for a more personal stay than at larger hotels. We checked out some other hotels while we were in Delhi (including the Imperial) and we were pleased with our choice.Highly recommended. "
the manor ,"An oasis of calm If you want to stay in a decent hotel in Delhi without staying in one of the big chain hotels try The Manor. The Manor is situated in a smart suburb of New Delhi. The rooms are fitted to international standards. The decor is clean and modern, if a little characterless. The character is provided by the charming staff. The modern Indian cuisine in the restaurant is excellent.One small note of complaint, the room I stayed in needed a bit of a refresh as some of the furnishings were beginning to look at little tired.I used The Manor as a stop over when catching my flight back to London. The process was seemless, I was met from on the platform from my train and delivered to the airport in the morning. Delhi can seem chaotic and intimidating. If you are a fairly well heeled tourist, The Manor will insulate you from this whilst you acclimatise and provide a good base from which to see Delhi. "
the manor ,"A calm place but at a price A great hotel away from the fun madness that is Delhi. Rooms are lovely and the restaurant is very good. However all this comes at a price - its expensive even by London standards. But if you have just arrived in India and want somewhere quiet to stay, its hard to beat. P.S If you intend to arrange transport through them, prepare to haggle alot as the prices they quote are very high. "
the manor ,"Excellent classy hotel This hotel is excellent and very classy. A relief after a 8 hours flight and no sleep! Rooms are spacious - I would recommend the suite though, with a modern deco. Very clean, with impeccable service and very quiet. With only 14 rooms, each guest is treated as a very special guest! Although I had read on Tripadvisor that there is a train line passing by the hotel, I can garantee that you can hardly hear it. The hotel staff were very helpful, picked us up from the airport (part of the service) and helped us booked our rail journey for the entire trip! The Food is excellent, amazing curries - nothing like what is served at home of course - the cuisine is very fine, blending fresh herbs and spices. Juices are completly made from fresh. The only drawback is its location (South of delhi), but hence the reason why it is so quiet too, as it is located in a posh suburb, and away from the bustle of Delhi. And if you like shopping the staff will take you to some special shops. I highly recommend it. "

the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Who gave this hotel a 5 star rating??? In a nutshell, very disappointing. At a push, I'd rate this hotel 4 stars with it's only saving grace being the very good Chutney restaurant that's part of the complex. Apart from one particular doorman, the staff were incredibly unfriendly and not overly helpful. Our room had a damp, musty smell about it, the bathroom was grimy and moldy and all the complimentary bathroom products had clearly been re-used that many times that the shampoo bottle's label had all but worn off. The hotel's 24hr cafe was also very average...ordered food did not come out as requested with no apologies and and for a 5 star hotel, I'd expect the bar to serve gin. This hotel needs a serious overhaul...not just the facilities but also the staff....some customer service training wouldn't go astray. In the meantime, can somebody please downgrade this hotel to a 4 star hotel as it's an embarrassment to every other 5 star hotel we've ever stayed at.PS. as already mentioned, the Chutney restaurant is excellent...great food and service and very accommodating regarding dietary requirements. My suggestion would be, stay at another hotel but got to Chutney for dinner. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"if you like food dont stay in MetroPolitian Hotel I’m staying in this hotel for 16 nights. from nov 14 to nov 29th, 2009. The food here is okay and because of my surgery, I cannot leave the hotel, so I eat here just about every day. Only twice i have ordered food from outside the hotel (delivery). Both times I had a call from downstairs about my food; I confirm that the delivery is for me. But no one helped me to bring it upstairs. the management would not allowed delivery boy to come upstairs nor he or any of the staff helped me for at least 20-25min. when I call front disk (they had no idea- and refer me to a manager), when I call the bell person- they asked me to call the front disk (Nov 17,20th in the evening orders, between 9-11pm). Both times the food finial got to my room Cold. And not eatable. Now i understand the policy of Hotel to try to make money by having there guest eat at their restaurants. At the same time- i do really feel that this is going too far by not allowing your guest to enjoy food from outside the hotel. I personally cannot eat the same food every day, and I have been to all your restaurants and order room service all the time. but when a guest would like to order from outside. it should be allowed. The manager's name was Ansha... he had no idea of what’s going on or didn’t care. I talk with him 4times during this period, I asked him to please have somebody bring my food from outside, and I cannot leave my room - with my condition. But he was not hearing me right. He kept repeating to me (I’m sorry, would would like some free food from hotel restaurants.) again back to the same thing.I would like an explanation of what happen and (is this the hotel policy; not to let their guest buy any food from outside?) if yes they is should be plainly written on your website. Please keep in mind- that I’m not looking for coupons and free stuff, I’m looking for better service and freedom to choose what I can put in my stomach. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Loved the Old world charm of the Hotel We had a three day stay in Delhi &amp; chose to stay at The Metropolitan, due to its ambiance, location &amp; old world charm. The building has a rare grace, which is a rarity at most hotels today, as the theme at most Hotels appears to be very Glitzy. The experience overall was very good, though the brackish water in the toilet &amp; bath were rather upsetting, this has resulted in toilet &amp; bath fittings getting rusted &amp; spoiling the overall experience a little.The buffet breakfast is good with a good selection of hot &amp; cold food, cereals, breads, etc., to choose from. We had only one meal at the hotel &amp; the South Indian fare for the Buffet lunch was very authentic &amp; tasty.Overall a very satisfying experience. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Don't bother with a ""Club Room"" We stayed at this hotel for five nights. Overall, we were quite disappointed with the hotel considering what we paid. It is not 5*. CLUB ROOMWe decided to pay extra for a club room thinking that we would get various 'extras' as listed on the hotel website. This included access to a Club Lounge with complimentary drinks and, according to the website, unlimited liquor. What we came to realise however, was that a lot of the so-called Club Room 'extras' are actually available to all guests. It is not worth the money.Our room was on the sixth floor. The decor inside was a little dated but no real complaints. On arrival I went to the bathroom and found a live cockroach scurrying across the floor!! I used a glass to trap it and flush it down the toilet. We had no other insect problems.The bathroom toiletries are pretty poor. No Molton Brown or Kama Ayurveda products as we had come across in the Taj / Oberoi hotels previously. The hotel slippers are nice.CLUB LOUNGEThe Club Lounge is a rather dank and uninspiring place to be. It is in the basement of the hotel and has no windows. There is a flat screen TV on the wall and quite a large selection of magazines. The staff in the Club Lounge are quite pleasant although requests for drinks were met with confusion, lots of discussions amongst the staff and telephone calls (presumably to other departments within the hotel - who knows). It all seemed very bureaucratic and slow. It was as though we had asked for some difficult request even though all we wanted was a vodka and coke. The promise of unlimited liquor between 18.30 and 20.30 was a very awkward affair. On one of the nights we went to the Club Lounge, we were told that the lounge was being used for a private function and so it was closed. After lots of fuss, we were allowed to use the bar in the lobby. On another night, we were told that we were not entitled to free drinks at all as we had apparently been upgraded and were not true &quot;Club Room&quot; guests. I had to complain to the hotel manager who sorted it out. Later that same night, we were told that we were only allowed two drinks maximum whereas the website promised &quot;unlimited liquor&quot;. I had to go into the Business Centre and print off pages from the website to prove that we were actually entitled to as many drinks as we wanted. The entire affair was frustrating.So far as the rooms are concerned, Club Rooms are no different to standard rooms. I know this because my parents were staying in a standard room and their room was identical to ours, albeit, on a lower floor.We also found the room very noisy. There was a strange clanking noise coming from the walls. I'm not sure if it was the air conditioning, water pipes or because our room was situated next to the stair well. We had quite a few restless nights. I would take ear plugs next time. PIGEONSThe hotel is plagued with pigeons which sit on the window ledges of the hotel. When you look out of the bedroom window, you can see roosting pigeons looking into your room as well as pigeon poop all along the window ledge. The pigeons also sit on the edge of the swimming pool and drink the water. This makes the pool seem very unappealing. There are only three sun loungers outside. We sat out a couple of times but there was a strong smell of sewage in the air that made sitting out very unpleasant indeed. This is probably outside the hotel's control to be fair.FOODThe selection at breakfast was very good and we were looked after very well. There is a man who makes omlettes / pancakes and there are plenty of food options choose from. On one occasion, we had to wait in the lobby to be seated for breakfast but this wasn't too much of a problem. You have to pay extra to eat at the Japanese restaurant for breakfast.The Chutney restaurant is also very good. We ate there three times as we were so impressed with the food. It is quite pricey compared to what you would pay on the streets but the service and ambiance is very good. The air conditioning can be quite intense so take your thermals.SPAThe spa is very good with a fantastic selection of treatments. The prices are pretty reasonable. The treatment rooms all appear to be kitted out very well. I had a massage where the therapist used her feet instead of her hands. I also had the treatment where a oil is dripped onto the centre of the forehead (the &quot;third eye&quot;) whilst being massaged by two therapists at the same time. Everyone was very pleasant in there. I very much recommend the spa. I did not use the gym but it appears to look very well equipped.Overall, this hotel is fine but it did not exceed our expectations in any way. I really think it is a bit cheeky to say that this is a 5* hotel and charge 5* prices. The service and amenities just are not there. The staff overall are very pleasant however and I am sure they are all trying their best. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"It is difficult to get everything wrong....however this hotel managed it! My wife and I have been working in Afghanistan for 18 months. Recently we were joined by our first daughter. We get 2 weeks leave every 2 months and we decided to go on our first family holidy to India - Goa to be more precise. However, our poor daughter became struck down with various Indian stomach bugs and we decided to go back to Delhi a day earlier - the only hotel ,which looked semi decent from the websites - was the Metropolitan New Delhi. What we needed was an oasis of calm before heading back to Afghanistan. Sadly, our one night at the Metropolitan Hotel made our holiday even worse!Where to start? Perhaps with the staff - every single member of staff, from the bell boys, to the room service to the receptionist were sooo ingratiating and would hang around furtively looking for a tip. They only gave the impression that they were doing anything at all for a few extra rupees! Next, the room - it was tiny and looked like it had not been renovated for at least 15 years - the style was very very out of date. Also, the &quot;separate seating area&quot; in the room amounted to an entire chair! Hardly a selling point. Room service, while coming quickly, was mediocre at best but do not be tempted to order any of the desserts - the two we had (tiramissu and New York Cheese Cake) were terrible (neither tasted like what they were supposed to). Additionally, do not bother tipping for room service (although the guy will hang around like all the staff looking extremely expectant!) since the hotel charges a 10% service charge on room service on top of the meal price! Then there wa breakfast - generally the food was poor, however, you know a hotel has hit a new low when it is looking to apparently save money on the morning coffee. The waiter poured if for us and at first we thought it was tea! It was so clear! We asked him what was going on and he replied &quot;No, its just very weak coffee...&quot; It really did look like some hot water had been placed in a kettle next to a jar of nescafe, but the two had only had the most fleeting of meetings....Finally, to cap it all, were their taxi policies. For some reason, if you get a black cab from the Metropolitan, their meters do not work. This of course then necessitates an annoing bout of haggling with the taxi driver once at your destination...Overall, the Metropolitan just managed to get everything wrong. We understand now why it was the only 4 star hotel with any rooms available on that night.... "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"no no NO no NO! For the sake of £20, stay in the Lalit or the Hyatt, or even the Ramada (Gurgaon or Delhi)I travel a lot around India and South Asia with my job, and I always try to stay in hotels where I can work, it's peaceful and it has a certain standard of service. Oh, and a good gym. That's probably the most important! I tend to stay in the Lalit when I'm in Delhi, but this time I decided to give the Metropolitan a shot - call it branching out. It was the worst mistake I could have made. The staff are generally unhelpful, there is a horrible musty smell permeating through the rooms and the corridors, the gym is a terrible A/C less (until you manage to find someone to switch the manual A/C on) basement windowless cave with no complimentary water, towels or anything that you would expect in a 5* hotel. More to the point, the rooms are antiquated (in a bad way), the plugs are coming off the walls, and if you need to catch up with work- forget it. The desks are such that I can't even get my legs under it because the chair is too high, so I have to sit in a strange, side on twisted position to get on with my work. Great for the back. And the room service menu is limited and small. Just don't stay here. Really. Go to one of the other hotels- I can't recommend the Lalit enough. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"please read my review before staying in this hotel we booked this hotel through thier website and clearly put 2 adults with 2 children, we were checked in to this room that half the carpet was black from cigeret ashes and no extra beds for my two childs. contacted the front desk and they said they will provide as one fold up bed for one child with additional charges. they brought this fold up bed...i will not let my pets sleep in it, after contacting the manager who was very very rude... he suggested to us that we all sleep in one double bed.... i demanded to speak to some one and the assiatant manager came to the room. i had already taken photos of the bed they supplied and told him that i will post this on all sites i can. he was the only stuff that understood our problem and told us to check out the suits, the suits came with a price but we had no options. the bed mattres springs were horrible. they also advertise tip free hotel... i swear the beggers on the street did not push you this much as they did...especially the front door man... he was unblelivable. the swimming pool area is discussting and please do not let your children swim... we did and my son and daughter both got sick... the we stayed thier in november and the aircon in the room only blows cold air and when you turn it off.. it turns on by it self at night while you sleep which gave us all cold.. the breakfast in the morning was also horrible... i can promise you some of the left over food gets warm for the next morning like noodles. when checking out we had 7 stuff surrounding our taxi for tips. only 2 desrved tip...the other 5 had thier hand inside the taxi for tip...we didnt know why... the management were just looking. they should pay thier stuff more so they dont beg. tip is for a service...but when they ask money with out any service...thats begging... overall very very disappointing stay, i will not recommend this hotel at all. the only man that i can say was help full was haider the assistant manager.... poor poor quality hotel, this can berated more like a 2.5 star hotel....it is very filthy and dirty also. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"5 tarnished stars I flew into India in the wee morning hours, arrived at The Met and was made to wait until they could a) find me a room b) proceed to clean said room after finding me one. I had pre-booked everything expecting that upon arrival I would be ushered to my room where I could take a long hot shower and settle in. WRONG! I was made to wait for about 20 mins. There after I was escorted to my room by staff eager to make a quick buck. I had just settled in after my shower when along comes a member from the cleaning staff (having just heard that a new cash cow had settled into a room on his floor) who knocked once and then proceeded to open my door. Good thing I had just come out of the shower and managed to wear something otherwise there would have been hell to pay. This persistent, rude, ignorant cleaning staff member was so caught up in trying to make a buck that he didn't realize I had just checked in under 30 minutes ago. He kept asking me if my room was clean. I should expect it to be so, I hadn't had a chance to do anything. The view from my room looked out onto the back of the property which included an abandoned over grown lot with a bunch of dumped mattresses, and some homeless children. Later on I needed to iron my clothes I called up reception who transferred me to housekeeping who said that I would have to put in a request for the next morning. I told them that I just needed to use and iron, I would do it myself, they insisted I put in a request for -something I needed done now- tomorrow morning. I also needed a charger for my phone, when I phoned reception they said they would track one down for me. They did and it turned out that the pin size I needed was actually broken and wasn't working. I ended up spending over 300 INR just on local phone calls. Before checking out I spoke with one of the Managers who said they were sorry for any inconvenience and that was it. Food was mediocre as was service. I feel this hotel really needs to re-classify themselves because honestly with the exception of upper management front of the house staff- all the other staff members are just keen on milking/begging tourists, and making a quick buck without providing any real service, "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Expensive and bring your own bath gel I went with an open mind after reading the reviews on trip advisor. Although the lady at reception was really nice and pleasant, the hotel and old and not too well looked after. What was really disappointing was the bath gel in the bathroom which came in a tiny bottle. It was so thick that you could turn it upside down and it would not flow out!Housekeeping does not replenish toiletries and I had to ration to make sure that I had enough to use for my stay there. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Average and expensive An average hotel in a good location. I don't think the hotel is 5 stars; in the best option I would give the hotel a 4- stars. Service is very &quot;bureaucratic&quot;. The usual smile but not helpful. Rooms are small and old and they have no character. I would recommend this hotel only if the price was in the range of 120$ per night and not in the range that it is now (over 200$).Go there only if you find a good bargain otherwise try to find something else. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Great moderate hotel close to Connaught Place Arriving at noon, I had no problem checking in and getting my room keys.The hotel is located 15min walk/$3 Tuktuk ride from Connaught Placewith restaurants and Palika Bazzar for shopping. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Very nice. Appriciated Ashok from Housekeeping Ashok was very attentive and made sure anything we needed was taken care of. We also appreciated the rooms and the security. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,very expensive hotel We stayed here in Sept 09.over 10 days we checked in 3 times as we were travelling around. it is very expensive to stay here.the 5 star Sakura hotel food is awful and so is the service.we had to complain as at £60 a meal in India you expect the best.The bar rates are terrible we had 2 beers and 1 malibu and coke we Paid £26.Be careful as we got followed outside this hotel by a rickshaw driver.they are in gangs to try to loot you please be careful dont listen to them..I would not stay here again as everyone expects tips even though it is a tip free hotelOur room view was a field were i saw people using the field as a toilet. All in All too expensive and well over rated. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Worst hotel I 've ever had to stay at you only get served on tips while it is called a tipless hotel The rooms were below the standard for this kind of hotels, the price they charge for the rooms are again too high for what you get. The roomservice was good if you put some money for the housekeeping, otherwise your room was not as neat as if you did tip the housekeeping. The towels and usual stuff you find in the bathroom were not replaced if again no tip was left! And there is also a lot of noise, not only during the day, but also at night, a lot of noise!Furthermore, doormen, the bellboy, the service all expect you to give them for every move they make, even if it is just calling the cab, and if you dont tip them, also again they the next time they act like you re air, while you are polite and kind to them....so dont!The taxidrivers are the worst, they make up prices and charge you at least twice as much as an other cabdriver would charge you, and almost push you to go to restaurants and shops they have a deal with, so they can earn a bonus, even if you dont want to, it feels like you re being kidnapped.So all together, the worst stay ever, and I have been to many countries and stayed in a lot of hotels of 4 and 5 stars, this hotel should be given a max of 3 star and they should pay their employees more, so they do better work and dont try to milk the tourists as a cow, but treat the tourists as they treat cows (holy)!Furthermore, the prices of the hotel differ from the internet, so try to pay before you go to the hotel, or you will be unpleasantly surprised!!!So all together my rewiuw is poor-average! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good Hotel The hotel is located in commercial Hub, Connaught Place, of New Delhi. It's very well connected to all means of Transportation. Cozy hotel with good service. Overall experience is good. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Gr8 value. We booked through the hotel website and got a good deal, ie. Rs.6600 all inclusive with breakfast for a standard room/night. the strange thing was, the hotel wouldn't themselves give us this rate and wouldn't suggest we make the booking through its website for a lesser rate! Perhaps an employee in sales trying to make his monthly quota? also, check the other online hotel booking sites for a slightly cheaper rate.When checking in, we were informed that we would have to 'pre-authorise' an amount of Rs.10,000. When asked why we should do this as they already had our credit card number, the staff couldn't come up with a valid explanation. It felt like they didn't trust the guests, or was it only Indian guests? I wonder! They wouldn't give a receipt for it either!this was a no-tips hotel, but it is so only in name. The staff are constantly engaging you in chitchat and there are 3 of them rushing to open the car door and then hovering around hoping for a tip! While i did tip the bell boy on principle, its absolutely ridiculous!The room was pleasant enough and so was the bathroom. It was quiet with a view of connaught place in the distance. The mattresses needed to be changed as they were really uncomfortable and sagging.The hotel is located right in the middle of things and we were a rickshaw ride away from the metro and there were restaurants in the vicinity. The breakfast was average.However, i have to mention that this hotel cannot be classed as 5-star deluxe. It is too small and the facilities aren't up to scratch. The staff arent that well-trained either.Apart from the check-in episode, i would stay in this hotel agian, given the stellar value for money. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Do not stay there - pay 30 US more and stay at Meridien for example staff was helpful enough to make it up for the very bad room and the overall conditions of the hotel We had to change 3 times because we could fell the wires inside the matress. Outdated rooms, not so cold shower, poor quality breakfast. We ordered room service and it was ok but nothing really good specially considering the price 15 us for a hamburguer. The only thing is that we hired a car to go to Agra and the driver was really good, no incidents, no crazy driving, no offerings to stop at any shop, expensive service though. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Not bad but not great Read very mixed reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor but decided to go ahead and book 2 nights as the price offered was very competitive.First impressions when arriving in the early hours of the morning were good and check in was quick and efficient. The room was a good size and furinished in a Mediterrean theme.Didn't wake in time for breakfast but had a good lunch in the cafe off the lobby at reasonable cost. As it was a Friday there seemed to be quite a few local business people having lunch there.Tried out the gym which was very small relative to the size of the hotel but reasonably well equipped. The changing room was far too small. After comments I had read on this site I didn't have high hopes for the pool area but I think the management have taken some measures to improve it. There seemed a reasonable number of sun loungers and the was clean. There were a lot of flies around the pool though - perhaps unavoidable given the central location of the hotel. What was very off putting was the staircase from the changing room to the pool which was covered in bird droppings and feathers - so many feathers I kept looking for a dead bird. The pool attendant, sat at the top of the stairs, seemed oblivious to the mess even when I pointed it out!Tried out the hotel bar but despite it being 8pm on a Friday night we were the only guests there. Lack of guests was perhaps made up for by the large number of hotel staff watching the 20:20 cricket finals on the large screen TVs!Checked out in a hurry and I didn't notice that I had been charged for the room which I had already paid for via Expedia. I contacted the hotel on returning home and they quickly acknowledged their error although it then took them over 2 weeks to pay the refund to my credit card.All in all I would say that this hotel is trying hard but does not live up to the international standards it aspires to. All the staff I came into contact with were extremely pleasant and tried hard. What is lacking is attention to detail. I expect that the hotel is struggling as there seemed many more staff than guests during our stay. I would stay there again, at the right price, but would also pay a little more to stay at an international 4 or 5 star hotel. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Enticing Its located near New Delhi's premier business &amp; shopping district. It has a beauiful landscaping. The hotel provides good hospitality, warmth and exceptional service.The hotel has 3 restaurant which provides Indian, Japanese and multi-cuisine cafe. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Too much noise for a top establishment A very comfortable four to five star hotel with all the necessary amenities and decent service. But if they're have a private pool party, as they do during Delhi's wedding and political seasons inthe winter months, it can be ridiculously noisy if your room is overlooking the pool. The loud &quot;thumpa-thumpa&quot; bass n' drums went on until 230 and the staff made noise cleaning up for two more hours after that. Complaints went unheeded and a form filled out and submitted to the manager produced no response whatsoever. I won't stay here again for this reason. A shame really because the Indian and sushi restaurants are great. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"decent hotel A decent hotel. Pricing was quite reasonable and that was the reason for choosing this hotel.Overall the rooms were a bit small but manageable - food at the restaurants was average and decent,.Not a very great lobby but was ok. Service was decent though people at the front office need to smile a bit.Overall a good hotel for business travellers. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Best value for money in Delhi! Relaxing ""No tips"" policy We spent two nights there. Very nice place with very helpful personnel! - No tips policy which is in place at the hotel is very important feature for Delhi. We stayed in one 5star hotel in Delhi in two weeks after Metropolitan and the manner of asking and waiting for tips was reaally annoying there. It made me sick. - Roomservice in Metropolitan is really good. - For exploring the city in the first day we hired a car with the driver from the hotel. My advise: guys, do the same if you don't know the city well or don't have local friends. It's not an easy task to get a cab (a proper cab, not a reeksha) in the city. Hotel drivers are more accountable. It's safer. It's much more comfortable (as air conditioning definitely will work in a car). And at the same time hotel drivers also know a lot of local stuff to show you around if you want. Yes, hotel cars are more expensive. But the difference is not that dramatic at the end of the day. Reekshas are cheap. But I didn't want to use them to travel through chaotic Delhi traffic. - The same is true for food. In the hotel - the food is more expensive than outside, but if you don't know how to choose and what to expect you'd better pay more and stay on a safe side. When you will know the city better you can safely explore other places to eat. But hotel restaurant is ok for newcomers. Location. Geographically the hotel is situated really close to central Connaught place. Which is good if you want to explore the city by yourself. At the same time the neighborhood seems to be not a good one. A lady at reception honestly informed us that we'd better not to walk around by ourselves at night. That sounded scary. But we walked a lot in afternoon and it was ok. I will not downgrade that hotel because of location since all the good hotels in Delhi surrounded by more or less the same environment. Either they are in sterile areas amidst governmental building or close to landmarks the hotels will be surrounded by high walls and guards. Therefore the close proximity of Connauhgt place is a plus in that case. To sum up. We found the hotel and its service really great especially on the contrast to some surprises and bad experience we got in other places in Delhi. Best choice for new guys in town in my opinion "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Fairly good but should be better A well locatied hotel with good sized rooms but what lets it down are the little things. Staff, though helpful are predominantly indifferent. The rooms are comfortable and extremely well maintained -- the housekeeping being the best feature of the hotel during my stay; I felt like I had a personal valet at times. The bathrooms are ok but the shower could have been a bit newer for this tier hotel. The breakfast selection is poor for this price hotel; I'd stayed at 3 star hotels with a better selection. Items are not replenished fast enough either and the overall breakfast service in lucklustre. Should you venture to have dinner here, you will be charged extortianate prices for things like burgers and club sandwiches-- you really wouldn't mind if the food quality and service were top notch, but they're just not. Internet access in the business centre is also extremely expensive so don't waste your money. The hotel boasts a very nice pool but there is no service at all around it; so if you happen to want a refreshment, you'll have to hunt around the lobby for a waiter or go get one yourself. There are only five, yes five, sunloungers for the entire pool; on the weekend it's fairly busy so if you want one, get up early and nab one. This didn't seem to be an issue during the week though. The location can't be faulted and the hotel was clean, secure and felt upmarket but when compared to other 4-5 start hotels I've stayed at in India, the overall service impression was lacking. If you manage a good rate, the service issues are bearable; if you're paying their full ratecard, stay somewhere else. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Little bit of Japanese in Delhi Hi,A Good hotel in a posh locality. Easy access to any point in Delhi. Plus being a Japanese themed hotel, helped the other guests who stayed along with me.The restaurant served very good food. There was some Thai festival going on at that point of time &amp; the spread was good. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good experience in Delhi Rooms are fine, Breakfast was very nice. Definately, staff is an asset to the Hotel.I especially like the &quot;No tip&quot; policy "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Give it a miss I have just returned from a trip to India which included a night at this hotel at the start and end of my holiday. I really hate to be negative but this hotel has few redeeming factors. I appreciate that it is not top-rate price for Delhi but the rooms were very ordinary and the club room I booked for one night was no different to the ordinary room. The restaurant was unbelievably slow and the staff were not at all attentive or interested. The club lounge was closed so could not be used (although the patio restaurant was available for use but we had to explain that we didn't have to pay for our coffee because it should have been free in the lounge.) Food and drink is very expensive. Also, it has recently been renamed and taxi drivers and tuktuk dirvers do not know where it is - we had an unpleasant tour of Delhi at 11.30 pm in a taxi which could not find it - he kept saying that the address we gave was for a different hotel. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"reasonable but left me with a bad taste My girlfriend and I were reasonably impressed by the quality of the Metropolitan on arrival. We found it quite an elegant, clean and well furnished hotel - pretty much in line with our expectations. However, we left a week later with a distinct feeling of having been thoroughly ripped off. The food and drink was *ridiculously* overpriced : on our first night, I had an extremely poor curry in the main cafe/restaurant and was charged the equivalent of 15 GBP. On the last night, while we waited for a taxi to the airport, I ordered a bottle of water at the poolside - it cost me approx 300 rupees, that's 10 times the price in the street outside. There's simply no excuse for this, it's just blatant profiteering. I accept that it was my own choice to pay these prices, but these episodes (and others) created a very bad taste in my mouth. I got an increasing sense that the hotel management was simply trying to fleece us for whatever they could get away with. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Excellent hotel a bit too expensive The Metropolitan is a comfortable place in &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; style, conveniently located close to Delhi's central Connaught Place. The hotel facilities and rooms are of excellent quality, although a bit limited (no real bar, only a noisy night club and two expensive restaurants - but a fine swimming pool).Service was just average. The pre-arranged pickup car at the airport wasn't there. Although friendly, the front staff was not very well informed (every question going beyond &quot;How do I get to the Red Fort?&quot; was met with blank stares). Room maintenance was excellent though. One day (out of my 9) the water in my bathroom was distinctly brown, but apart from that everything functioned.I was more disturbed by the price of every extra. Hiring a car through the hotel cost about the double of what I could arrange myself; internet acess at 300 Rs for half an hour is a ridiculous price for Delhi; and the breakfast buffet (though excellent) at 750 Rs was also a bit hefty - this is Delhi after all, not London.But overall the Metropolitan proved a welcome oasis every evening after the hustle of Delhi. Knowing the city better now I'd probably not go back and try to find a slightly cheaper hotel with more character, but for a first-timer with some money to spare, this is a good choice. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"A comfortable experience I travel to Delhi several times a year and generally prefer to stay at the Metropolitan. It is conveniently located on the Bangla Sahib Road near Connaught place but the locality is quiet.The staff is prompt and efficient. The rooms are not very large but make up with the soft lighting, comfortable bed and seats.It has 3 restaurants which serve Indian, Japanese and world cuisine. The buffet dinner is sumptuous with a good salad counter, Indian and oriental fare.For the price of the rooms in a city like Delhi where the hotels are mindlessly expensive, the Metropolitan offers good value for money especially for the business traveller like me. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Professional Staff Me &amp; my wife booked the deluxe std room for our wedding night but at the check-in time, we were provided complimentary upgrade from the management in the executive floor + a bottle of house-wine.Buffet breakfast in the morning was par excellence and so was the chocolate truffle cake we ordered from their bakery.The hotel is centrally located in New Delhi and also offers in-room dining 24hours. They have a great pool, well equipped gym &amp; massage service and lovely spa to relax everyone.Besides being positioned as a business hotel and we not being business guests, we really felt nice with their hospitality.We would definitely recommend this to other people across the world since we ourselves experienced the professionalism. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Very Mixed Experience. I booked two stays at this hotel in the last month. On the first occasion, I arrived at about midnight and was given a smoking room which they tried to convince me was non-smoking. After returning to the reception and insisting they moved me, I was given a non-smoking room. On the second occasion I was given a room with a non-smoking sign screwed onto the door, but it stank of cigarette smoke and thus was clearly not what I had asked for. The reception staff were relatively clueless and unable to answer any of the questions I asked. They always referred me to either the bell boys or the travel desk. The hotel did not have a concierge, and the travel desk was actually a tour company, so as you can imagine they did not give impartial advise. In fact, when asked which train station my onward train left from, they sent me to the wrong station (luckily i had plenty of time to rectify the situation).In terms of service, the bell boys were excellent, always giving me the information i needed with a smile.The food was the best thing about the hotel. The morning breakfast (included in the room price) was an extensive buffet with European, Indian and Oriental foods, all very tasty - a very good start to the day. I also ate in the Indian Restaurant which was also high quality, but extremely expensive given the costs of food elsewhere (1800 Rp/person).The internet was extremely fast, but seemingly extortionate at 250Rp per hour or 750RP per 24hrs.I initially booked this hotel because there was a 45% discount on the room rate (5500 Rp from 10,000). If I had paid full price for the room I would have been very unhappy. Overall it was an average and expensive experience. This is in no way a 5* hotel, it is a middling 4*. Next time I return to Delhi I intend to try out a different hotel. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,must try nice hotel restaurants and spa.... pool should be taken care of and reception is not the best ....but rooms and bathrooms are nice...close to the gurudwara and CP so that is also a plus point...nice hotel overall...must try.... 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Disapointing for a 4/5 Star Indian Hotel We booked this Hotel for the last night of our India Adventure, we stayed in 5 Hotels in two weeks, the previous 4 absolutely fabulous (strongly recommend the Taj Hotel Chain), this hotel looked good value in terms of cost and service, they even market as a &quot;tip free&quot; Hotel which is the case however what they dont tell you is that they add a 20% compulsary service charge on every service, every drink and meal which is far more than any tip you might give.The Staff in Indian Hotels are normally very freindly and effcient however in this Hotel they are totally unmotivated (probabaly due to the lack of Tips), the resturant staff get orders wrong and trip over each other, they all appear to be trainees. At checkout time the bill is so complicated with service charges its almost impossible to see what you have or havent been charged for.To be fair in your average European city this hotel would be ok/avaerage but certainly not up to the usual standard for 4/5 Star Indian Hotels.On a Plus point Japenese resturant is lovely "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Perfection of scamming If you get a bit tired and annoyed with the scamming on the streets of New Delhi, don’t book into the Metropolitan, because they have pushed things to a new level… We had arranged our own transport to the airport since we did not want to pay the inflated rates at the hotel, but staff at the Metropolitan were barefaced enough to chase our driver away so that we had to use their taxi! We were also not allowed to cancel our breakfast for the last night although we had to check out at 4am in the morning. Instead we were given a really impressive packed breakfast consisting of a small o-juice, a stale doughnut, an apple and a sad Danish pastry at the charge of £14. If you don’t mind this kind of callousness, the outdoor pool is lovely after a day in the city and the rooms are nice enough if you are not after high end design. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good Option In Delhi I had a very comfortable one night stay in this hotel.In a city where hotels are not very cheap, I through the £80 I paid for this one was good value. The hotel is in a good position, a short tuk tuk ride to Connaught Place which was good for a drink and evening meal. I had one lunch and the hotel and the food was quite food - pretty much Westen prices. The rooms were simple but nice and the pool I think is a must- a great way to relax after some the heat of sightseeing in Delhi. In summary I think the hotel is good value and a very comfortable place to stay in a nice city. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,poor service This is not a &quot;no tip&quot; hotel. The staff is constantly chasing you for tip.The staff was rude. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good enough Highlights:-Reasonably priced-Good Location-Friendly staff-Good restaurants-Nice gift shopDisadvantages:-Rooms are old-More birds are swimming in the pool than people-No convenience store-Had the potential to charge you for everything (e.g. use of the business center's internet)If we were to travel back to New Delhi, I might look for another place to stay. But if I couldn't find anything else close to the $200/night range, I would stay here again. However let's hope the hotel rooms get remodeled soon. They're over due. I would like to thank the staff for their kindness. We pre-booked our rooms, but had to change our plans due to an unexpected illness. Fortunately the hotel staff was understanding and accommodated our changes with no penalty. Thank you. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Pleasant convenient and clean We spent 5 nights at The Metropolitan. I travel a lot on business and am picky about sheets and cleanliness. I was a little worried about what a moderately priced hotel in India would be like (based on horror stories from others)--and we didn't want to pay for a really high-priced hotel. We found the rooms (7th flr) pleasant and clean (good high count cotton sheets..), and the location was convenient. My room had a rather &quot;odd&quot; view of a garbage dump and a slum, but my co-traveler's room had a beautiful view. As we also found in Mumbai hotels catering to westerners, the Metropolitan is taking security seriously. The staff were helpful--and we especially enjoyed talking to one of the young waiters about current events in Pakistan. I had to have some clothes cleaned and while it was expensive, I have to admit the clothes looked perfect when I got them back at the end of the day. The only unpleasant surprise was the high taxes imposed on the room rate, something I had overlooked in mentally calculating the cost. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,very happy with 3 night stay spent our first three nights in india being eased in at the metropolitan before staring a two week group trip with intrepid though rajastan. easy location to head out to sites and shopping. pleasant staff- great breakfast buffet.check out the craft house. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Perfect Hotel for Visit to Delhi The Metropolitan Hotel is a five-start hotel located about a 20-minute drive (with no traffic, 50 minutes in rush hour) from Delhi's airport and is a perfectly located gem for both visiting Delhi and just relaxing away from the bustle of the city. Check-in is easy and smooth, although different in the respect that each guest is seated at a desk with a receptionist as opposed to a long counter like you find in most 5-star hotels. There was a special on hotels.com which permitted us to book at $110/night although our general experience is that those &quot;specials&quot; usually mean you can get the same rate if you book with the hotel directly. If you do, there are a number of airlines for which you can get an extra 500 airline miles (I think American was one, I forget the others).Your bags are quickly whisked upstairs to your room. The Metropolitan seems pretty reliable about its &quot;no tip&quot; policy for employees, but if you're a Westerner visiting India, it seems fairly stingy not to tip and in our experience, the tips are not refused (although it is nice that employees do not linger, hoping that you will).The rooms are spacious and clean, especially the bathrooms. Having clothes cleaned or pressed is easy and affordable (they do not provide irons and ironing boards). Internet costs about USD15 per day, which is a little pricey, but, in our case, necessary. After checking in, we arranged to have a private driver take us to the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort very early in the morning -- the travel desk was entirely accommodating and did not blink when we asked to leave at 4am (we had to return to Delhi by early morning). The cost was USD200, although that is for the car so if you have a number of passengers, it's very affordable and well worth it. The trip to Agra took 3 hours on the nose, although there was no traffic. The cost includes an English speaking guide which we did not want, but they provided anyway and it was nice to have someone there to help negotiate the entry of a larger camera (and its evidently more threatening battery). I probably do not need to recommend the visit to the Taj Mahal -- it is as stunning and grand as you think it is. Entry is USD15 for foreigners although we were told that the Indian government was changing the entry fee so that all who want to enter (foreigners and Indians -- who now pay next to nothing) will pay USD4.The trip back was 4.5 hours (heavier traffic, especially from Faridabad to Delhi).The Metropolitan Hotel is a unit of Summit hotels and caters explicitly (although obviously not exclusively) to Japanese tourists and businesspeople. That's neither here nor there except that there is a very nice store located on the hotel premises called &quot;Craft House&quot; at which you ban buy very affordable gifts and souvenirs and they also have a smaller selection of Japanese items. There is also what is evidently regarded as one of the nicest Japanese restaurants in Delhi, although we did not eat there.The staff were all friendly and helpful and we cannot recommend the hotel high enough (it is also in close proximity to the Gate of India and shopping on Connaught Place).The only complaint I would register is the outrageous cost of printing in the business center (USD1 per page). "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Excellent hotel....not sure about the restaurant! After 11 days traveling round india in mid range hotels we decided to treat ourselves for our final night in India. The service and room did not disappoint us. All you would expect from a 4* hotel (not sure it reaches 5*). Its location is perfect for all the touristly hot spots and refreshingly it is tip free. However, instead of having the relaxing end to our trip that we wanted we were violently ill after eating at the very expensive Chutney restaurant. In defence of the hotel, I did not have to pay for the meal and they did supply us with a free airport transfer but this unfortunately I had to request this as it was not offered automatically. I can only assume that this was due to different expectations of customer service and the fact that they may not of had anyone complain about food poisoning before. We would stay here again, but we would stear clear of the restaurant! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Building work...what building work? We stayed here on two separate occassions, two weeks apart at the begining and end of our holiday. The first time at the start of March 09, no problems at all and infact we were very happy with our stay. The only quibble would be the addition of a 5% service charge and whopping 18% luxury tax on everthing, making this hotel quite a bit more expensive than it might seem at first.The second occassion was an entirely different experience. Having checked in (room 701) we could hear drilling and hammering so we called reception to ask if this would go on for long and if so could we be moved. Having been assurred that the work would finish within the hour we decided to stay put. We headed out for some sightseeing returning late afternoon to find the door to a room two doors down was open and workmen drilling and hammering away. Another call to reception to ask why the work hadn't stopped and we were given more assurances that the work would finish immediately. It didn't.By 7.30 pm the noise was still continuing so I went to speak to the duty manager who denied that any building work was going on. I asked him to come up to the room so he could hear for himeself and after he made a phone call, he followed me up. Needless to say, there was no noise when he arrived. He said there was a factory next door and the noise must have come from there. Not very happy at the suggestion that I was being called a liar I assurred him that if there was any more noise I would be seeking a reduction in my bill.Returning from dinner at 9.45pm I was staggered to be met by the sound of more drilling and so went to investigate where the noise was coming from. Through a service door on the 8th floor I find a team of workmen drilling and hammering away. While about to take some photos to prove to the duty manager that work was going on and in this hotel, the housekeeping manager comes along, claiming he was going to tell the workmen to stop. I asked the housekeeping manager to accompany me to see the duty manager to tell him that the work was continuing, which he does and I am assurred by the duty manager that that really is the end of it - there will be no more work. 10 minutes later, back in my room, what can I hear: more drilling and hammering. Feeling pretty angry at this stage I was going to go and tell the workmen to stop myself but upon getting to the service door, I find the duty manager there himself, finally accepting that there is building work going on in the hotel and assuring me he will stop it immediately. Returning to my room, I was called by the duty manager, apologising for the noise and accepting that the hotel had made a mistake. I told him I wanted a reduction in my bill but he claimed I had booked the room at a good rate so he couldn't give me a reduction. An argument followed that the rate I was paying was not the point, the point was the shocking level of service, lies by the hotel staff (indeed its managers) and the fact that our day at the hotel had been ruined by the noise of building work. Request refused!Went to bed. The work near my room had indeed ceased....but I could still hear drilling in a distant part of the hotel until just before midnight, they had simply moved to work elsewhere.We had an early checkout to catch a plane and again I requested a reduction in the bill, which was again refused. Not sure of quite how bad the legal consequence of leaving a hotel in India without paying could be and needing to catch a flight I agreed to pay the bill under duress but have advised them I would be complaining and ensuring that our experience was posted here on Tripadvisor, which didn't elicit any discernable concern.Not a happy experience. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Perfect for a very fussy other half! Having visited India many years ago, I knew what to expect from low to mid range hotels. Therefore taking along my girlfriend who simply has to have everything &amp; anything spotlessly clean and anticeptic, I knew this was going to be a challenge.What a find the Metropolitan was. Of the top range hotels in Delhi, it was one of the cheapest. We paid approximately £100 for a room for the night (no breakfast). However it was money well spent.Location: equal distance from Connaught Place &amp; the Rajpath, this meant that 2 main attrations were only 5 to 10 minutes away. A taxi ride of approx 150 rupees was all it took - an obvious rip off for locals, but still an absolute bargain for tourists. Also at 45 mins taxi from the international airport (approx 900 rupees) then this was ideal as well. The hotel is an obvious island of luxury amoungst the chaos of Delhi, but this is the same all over the city - if you want New England then go to not New England. Thsi is Delhi!Service: &quot;THIS IS A NO TIP HOTEL!&quot; Bliss! No social errors here. It's not the money, it's the principle. Courteous and attentive staff. All said hello, but were not obtrusive. Bar staff on hand when you wanted them. The reception desk staff were not the cheeriest in the world, but were still polite &amp; attentive. The restaurant staff were extremely helpful, and again only appeared when you wanted them to. Concierge / door staff were excellent at getting taxis, usually arriving in less than a minute.Security: With the current climate in India, this wa sof note. A good taxi search on our arrival. The gront gates were always manned by at least 3 security staff. Electronic front door check. The rooks were the usual card key type. Safes in the rooms. There couldn't be more effort to make us feel secure.Rooms: Spotlessly clean. Linen immaculately clean, spotless &amp; crisp. Usual slippers to keep sensitive feet from the carpet. Bathrooms also spotless, as were the fluffy towels. TV had a good selection of channels (&gt;50?), with a larg-ish flat screen TV. Plenty of wardrobe &amp; drawer space and the rooms in general felt very spacious. Beds were made up immaculately, and were very comfortable, on the firm side.Food / bars: We ate in the Indian restaurant in the hotel. Very classy, a good selection, and again very clean. The service was helpful and knew whn to arrive or go away. As experienced Indian food buffs, this was top stuff. You pay hotel prices, but what you get is better than most places in the city. We also had breakfast a few times. A generla buffet, covering English/US breakfasts, Indian, or Japanese. Again, no complaints. Very good tea. The one bar didn't seem to be used much, and had the aircon a bit too cool, but the service was very good.Pool / public areas: Lovely size pool. A bit chilly in February, but certainly warmer than home! Plenty of fresh towels on hand. There were only 5 recliners though. A minor fault. The open areas inside &amp; out had plenty of nice seating &amp; tables. The outside area was used for a wedding on 2 days, which meanyt music at night, but this finished at 11pm.Overall, money well spent, and got a full thumbs up from my very, very fussy girlfriend. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good hotel We stayed at the Met Hotel in Delhi for two nights.The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly particularly housekeeping.We used this hotel as a base for sightseeing which it is very good for.We enjoyed the breakfast here. They offered Indian as well as continental breakfast and fresh eggs.The cafe for an afternoon snack was not so good as little choice The pastry I had was not very nice (artificial tasting) and the same for my partners cake, but this shouldnt put you off the hotel - just dont eat here for lunch.We didnt eat in the restaurants here but I believe they are very good.The hotel had a nice pool and we booked the this hotel because it had a pool as after a day of sight seeing it is nice to have a dip however unfortunately for the two days that we stayed at this hotel on both afternoons the hotel was getting the poolside ready for weddings (we did go in the wedding season) and as such we were unable to use the pool both afternoons which was a bit annoying as we had paid extra for the priviledge, had I known I would not have been able to use the pool I would not have booked it and paid the extra.Upon checking out I did mention this to the reception staff to see if I could get any discount on my bill but they said that as they had already calculated the bill they would be unable to change it and as we were running late for a train i didnt have time to argue with them. They did offer me a breakfast to take with me for the journey for free but i didnt have time to wait for them to pack it up for me. I would stay here again as the place is nice and we enjoyed a nice drink at the bar one evening (which has a dark and seductive ambience) but next time if I have any complaints I will maike them heard before they calculate the final bill.

the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"perfect for our final night in India We decided to stay at a five-star hotel to give ourselves a bit of a treat as our final night - I think it was well worth it. The room was nice, the bed was super-comfortable.The seafood buffet &amp; breakfast buffet were both quite nice!The hotel is looking a bit tired in places though and it could be a little cleaner.To start with I like the fact it was a tip-free hotel (although what they don't tell you when you check-in is that everything comes with a service charge - aka there's the tip)Would recommend this hotel quite happily :)Not sure if this is a gay-friendly or not hotel - but they had no problems changing a twin room to a double room (ie, giving us the one bed rather than having us in seperate beds) "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Nice stay but I'd try another hotel next time Namaskaar. I stayed at the Metropolitan in December 2008, for three nights over the Christmas holiday. Sorry to be late getting my review on this site. The hotel is located in Connaught Circle area. Even though the hotel is downtown, getting around Delhi still requires a taxi or tuk tuk. When the new Metro (subway) system is up and running by 2010 for the Commonwealth Games, getting around Delhi will be much easier for tourists. The tourist sights are spread out and are difficult to get to if you wish to walk around. This hotel has a tourist office on the main floor. The staff is very friendly and are eager to book a tour for you should you wish to spend 2,700Rs for a four-hour tour/with car and guide. For me, a tad bit expensive. Finding a taxi driver or even a tuk tuk just outside the gates of the hotel is far more affordable and fun. You can hire a taxi for the day for about 750Rs and the driver is with you for an eight-hour period. I agree with one of the previous comments about the smell in this hotel. Should you decide to stay here, get a room in the front of the hotel. There is a factory of some sort (see attached photo) at the back of the hotel (just over the wall from the pool) and pollution bellows out from three smoke stacks. When I discovered where the smell was coming from, I requested a room at the front of the hotel and I was immediately accommodated. Another negative experience while staying at this hotel was the cleanliness of the bathroom, in particular the stand-up showers. There was a great deal of mould on the tiling and was in desperate need of scrubbing. The carpets are dirty and old and need to be replaced. There is a business center on the lower level and Internet fees are 300Rs, plus tax, for 30 minutes. Expensive for me. Seeing I was there over the Christmas holiday, I guess the room rates were at the high season rates and I found it expensive. I only ate breakfast at this hotel and the food/service was good. This hotel gets high marks from me, for a very friendly staff. Hats off especially to the doormen. Great guys! Oh yes, there is a nice gift shop near the pool, Craft House, India. Very fine quality gifts and helpful staff. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Beautiful Hotel with Great Staff at the Metropolitan We loved the hotel and all of its staff. The rooms were very nice and large and the staff was always available and very attentive. The one negative I would say of the hotel is the smell just outside by the pool and all the way downstairs near the business center. We could not pinpoint what it was, but it smelled awful for the days we were there. It was fine in the restaurants and in the rooms so could have been something just outside but it lasted for three days. I would recommend the hotel and return. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Top hotel in Delhi I had a good stay in this hotel, staying for 5 nights and dining there twice . On both occasions, I had an excellent meal. The staff were very helpful and friendly. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Very pleasant for me I travel to Delhi every two months, at the moment.I was offered a special promotion so I decided to change from my normal hotel booking to try the Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi.The first impression, reception services, porter etc, were very good, very helpful and pleasant.The room was excellent. The Spa was excellent.Good internet services, which are critical for me.I didn't try the Japanese restaurant, as I am not a fan of Japanese food. The Indian restaurant was very good indeed. The restaurant and bistro in the lobby was good food, but I found service a little lacking on occasions. I did not use the hotel bar, as I normally do, as it seemed to be more geared to a young persons nightclub.The central location of the hotel is superb.If I can get the same special promotion, I will certainly be back.

the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Decent Hotel We stayed at the Metropolitan following a great stay at the Imperial--so that probably colored our experience--but the hotel was nice--the breakfast was pretty good and the rooms were dated but comfortable. The service at the concierge for arranging a car to the airport was lacking but no big complaints. If you get a cheap rate, it's a fine place to stay. Not much to do there--so a bigger hotel may be better! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"A good place to stay A pleasant enough hotel. We loved the breakfast and the food on level one for dinner was superb. All staff are very friendly. As our first stop in India, it was good to know an ATM was just a walk down the road. We only had one problem. We arrived at midnight after flying all day and were looking forward to a quiet night's rest. There is a bar downstairs which had been hired out for a function (Sunday night). Doof Doof music finished around 3. Our heads stopped thumping about a day later. We must be getting old. No problems the second night. I would be cautious about booking this hotel over the weekend in case another function has been booked. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"High quality hotel with excellent service!! Metropolitan Hotel offers a service that you seldom meet even at higher rank hotels in other countries. It seems that Metropolitan gives you the best service India can offer in a very nice manner. The restaurants are excellent with very nice food. The food is not as inexpensive as on other restaurants in Delhi, but with European standards prices are relatively low. The rooms are clean and very nice and internet service is available at a small fee. All in all this is a very nice hotel well worth 5 stars by most standards. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Not as advertised Both Hotels.com and The Metropolitan guaranteed a comfortable stay for 3. Careful attention went into booking a hotel where 3 could sleep without a roll away bed. After calling The Metropolitan myself I booked the room that Hotels.com and the hotel directly told me included 2 beds and a separate sleeping area with a sleeper sofa. When we arrived late at night after 40 hours of traveling we found a very small room with a roll away waiting for us in the hall. Besides that this was not the room I was guaranteed, the roll away was rock hard, the mattress disgustingly filthy and torn. They had to remove a chair in the room to make room for the roll away and of course, there was only enough room on the floor for our 4 suit cases. We had to step over suit cases to get to the bathroom or out the door. The managers were firm in their position that this is what I had booked and would not consider moving us. It was not until I threatened to complain to Hotels.com and American Express that a 3rd manager was willing to move us to the room I had originally booked but this room only had 1 King. All other rooms were booked. They did manage to find us a futon that was less disgusting turned upside down so I slept on an angle the last of 3 nights. The only consideration the hotel gave us was crediting the shuttle ride which we were overcharged for in the first place. The hotel is clean and the restuarant, although catering to an international crowd was way over priced. We were also there during the attacks on Mumbai and although they informed us that they were stepping up security, there was little visible additional measures taken short of checking our car when we arrived one night. We agreed to pay the additional costs to stay in a comfortable hotel and could have saved hundreds, if not a thousand dollars staying in an ashram. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"3-Star worth a visit if you can find a decent price Stayed at The Metropolitan for a few days shortly before Christmas. Not too many other guests around, possibly as a result of the international economic downturn and the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai. However, a party appeared to be enjoying a private engagement in the hotel's public room's at least one night during my stay.As at other large hotels in the city at the moment, all cars were checked for suspicious contents before being allowed to enter the grounds, and visitors'/guests' handbags were searched.I took a prepaid taxi from the airport to the hotel. Neither the driver nor the Delhi Traffic Police prepaid taxi booth attendant recognized the name &quot;The Metropolitan,&quot; but I was able to show them the location on a map I had brought and had no trouble going directly to the hotel. (I'm not sure whether they did not recognize the name because the hotel is also/or used to be known as the Nikko.)All of the staff with whom I interacted, from reception to checkout, were friendly and welcoming. On checking in, I requested a quiet room. I had booked a deluxe room through the hotel's website (Rs. 7500 per night, which is about US$155 before taxes and service fees -- note that taxes and fees increase the total amount substantially); however, I was upgraded to a club room with complimentary breakfast on the side of the hotel away from the street. (I didn't have a chance to take advantage of the breakfast -- I was too busy eating my way around Delhi the rest of the day!) The fittings of the bathroom, bathrobe and slippers, daily newspapers, etc. were all very nice, but the view didn't quite fit with the concept of a club room in a &quot;5-star&quot; hotel. The room was comfortable, although smaller than I had expected from the website description; the website described a deluxe room as having a &quot;comfortable, separate sitting area,&quot; and I naturally assumed a club room would be even larger than that.The bathroom was also relatively small, but was the nicest part of the room.There were maybe three dozen television channels listed in the hotel guide in the room. However, the reception was acceptable for little more than a half dozen, most of these broadcasting in Hindi.My room was quiet during the night, and I slept soundly, although the mattress was extremely firm.Internet access was Rs. 750 plus tax per 24 hours. (The website description of the rooms is misleading in that it suggests that internet access is included with the rooms, rather than that internet access is available in the rooms for a separate fee.) I was able to connect from my room most of the time I attempted to, but there were a number of times that my laptop could not find a wireless access point or that the signal was lost.The hotel is located about a 20-minute walk from Connaught Place and the Rajiv Chowk metro subway station. (There is also a cluster of restaurants, including a shop that sells pastries and ice cream, just 5 minutes down the block.) After my first few days in New Delhi, I decided to move to a hotel further south to be nearer some of the restaurants and other attractions I wanted to visit. (Incidentally, I noted while searching for hotels that the rates The Metropolitan was advertising had dropped considerably from what I was already paying.) I called the hotel's travel desk to inquire as to approximately how much a taxi would charge to take me to the other hotel, which was about 4 km away, and I was told Rs.1000 plus tax. I ended up calling a taxi myself and paying about 1/10 what the hotel travel desk had quoted me.Overall, this is a reasonably-well maintained and comfortable hotel that I would be willing to visit again for around US$160 per night (plus taxes, fees). I would be more enthusiastic about recommending the hotel if the website presented a more accurate description of what is on offer, and if more services were included in the basic room rates (eg internet). I can't see anyone paying US$400 per night, as described in another review. For that kind of money, I would go to The Imperial, where I have stayed on most of my past trips to New Delhi. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"My home in Delhi I stayed in many hotels in Delhi, from luxury to budget hotels. I didn't find a better hotel than Metropolitan in the aspect of value for money. Its size, which is not too big, its location near Connaught Place, its friendly staff and the good-looking and comfortable rooms - Makes it the perfect hotel for me "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Nice stay but shared the room with a mouse Spent a conference week in Delhi and wanted an upscale hotel. The Metropolitan was a nice place to retreat from the caotic and smoggy Delhi streets. Staff was very friendly. I would recommend eating at the Indian restaurant as food and service was exellent and good value for money. Also the lobby restaurant with changing theme buffet was nice. The concrete paved small pool area was a disappointment as I had thgought about relaxing a bit by the pool. There were also renovation people working around the pool every day and only two sun beds awailable and the area just did not look too inviting. Then there was the mouse in my room. One night just when I was about to swich the nightlight off there was a small mouse running across the wall to wall carpet floor. As this was supposed to be a 5* hotel, out of principle I called the reception and asked them to do something about the mouse. After a while the reception called askin had I seen a mouse or a rat? I told that it luckily was only a mouse and soon three staff members came into the room and started to mowe the furniture around. I had lots of fun while follwing the mouse chace. The mouse ran around the room for a while and then disappeared behind the huge wooden wardrobe. Some other guest also told me that they too shared their room with a mouse. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"A comfortable but expensive hotel fine for a business trip The hotel's maint strength is a real comfort for a business trip. You will get more or less everything you need for your business. That said it is really expensive, even for Dehli, and the staff is at the reception really cold and useless. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Sakura Restaurant - Shouyu Ramen... Yum!!! The Shouyu Ramen in the Sakura restaurant was as good as the ramen in Japan!!!This is the first time I've come across ramen equally as good, anyone in the world!!!I am so impressed &amp; would come to stay again, just for that!!!Nisha. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"The Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi - Excellent as Always On my trips to New Delhi, I have, in this year been regularly staying at the Metropolitan and I have found the services offered by them as also the culinary experience at the Hotel exceptional. The Breakfast spread, in particular, is vast and has something for everybody from every part of the Globe. The In House services are also very good and the Rooms on offer are, to say the least, luxorious. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"good option I stayed one night here and started well as they were waiting at airport to pick me up. I'd booked through a hotel booking site and paid for a pick up. Emailed hotel direct to arrange this and all done easilly. Room was good and slept well - is very quiet compared to some delhi hotels. Meal in Chutney was very nice and relaxed experience. Overall though I would say that hotel a little soul less, but worked well for what I needed for one night to recover from flight . If you want somewhere with a pool to relax by, this may not be best option. Pool is in a concrete setting with plenty of pigeons enjoying a wash and no sign of people or service..only two sunbeds in sight. The pool at shangri-la a much nicer setting and easy to get drinks and lunch from the poolside. Overall shangri-la felt like a more lived in hotel, but metropolitan a good option for easy stay, and good nights sleep. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Absolutely LOVED our stay - wish we could have stayed longer! Frankly, I am shocked by the bad reviews here because I had an extraordinary experience at the Metropolitan and the service was by far some of the best I have received in India.We were in an awful hotel in the South Delhi area and wanted to make our last night in Delhi perfect. Thankfully, the Metropolitan had a room and a discounted internet rate. After losing the better part of our day trying to get some hot water for a shower at the first hotel, we finally made our way to the Metropolitan and were greeted with sublime comfort, exquisite service and a hot, hot, hot shower!! We had a room on one of the Club Level floors (6th) and it was perfect. Clean and comfortable, well appointed and so quiet. It was magnificent!We ate lunch at The Patio, the main restaurant in the lobby area and opted for the buffet. There were many wonderful things to choose from, including some of the most artistic looking desserts I have ever seen. I found the service to be attentive but not overly instrusive.For dinner that evening, we opted for Chutney. I like the ambience of this restaurant with its comfortable seating, low lights and nice service. Definitely a nice place for a romantic dinner. The food was good but not off the charts great!After my boyfriend left to make his flight home, I had an entire day left before my flight. I booked myself a spa treatment which I will say was right on par with any spa treatment I have received in the US. A couple of times the power cut, but hey...it's India! My technician was attentive and my massage and facial were relaxing and enjoyable. I appreciated the fresh fruit and tea afterwards!I found check in/check out to be problem-free and quick and the bell staff helpful and organized. They held my luggage as I took in some sights of Delhi before my departure and everything went smoothly when I needed to retrieve it. My thanks to Nitin (in The Patio) for his sightseeing suggestions - I did manage to get to the India Gate!Overall, I found this hotel to be one of the best places I have stayed while in India. My first choice usually are service apartments when traveling in India, but since this was a one night stay and the last night we were to be in Delhi, I opted for a little extra pampering. My only wish now, looking back, is that we would have stayed here our first night in Delhi also!!!! It was worth the extra $$ paid.We enjoyed every minute of our stay and look forward to future stays when back in Delhi. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Worth every penny spent! I stayed at this hotel for a night with my spouse and give it 100% ratings for the money it costed me. This is one of the reasonably priced 5 star hotel in the centre of Delhi, very much accessible by all means of transport. The food was good, specially the Japanese restorant, Sakura and the indian (guess it's called Chutney). I stayed at the delux room. The ambience of the room was great, the bed was comfortable, bathroom and other accesseries were decently fine. The service was good too. Also, I'd like to mention that while booking the rooms here, do it via the hotel website as they usually have Special tarrifs, which are quite low than the ones offered by travel agents/sites. All in all, a place worth spending a weekend getaway/Business trip. Go for it! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Unfriendly and unwelcoming Found the metrolitan hotel terrible - the staff were rude, unfriendly and unattentive. We had requested a taxi pick up by email a week before arrival &amp; to confirm how much it would cost. As we had had no response we made our own way to the hotel. When we got to the door the manager asked us in a rude accusatory voice 'Our taxi is WAITING at the airport for you - why did you make your own way??', we literally hadn't even got in the door at this stage! After waiting 1.5 hours we got to our room even though we'd requested an early check in. The room was clean but just bland and certainly not 5 star standard. the pool area was very run down - old seats, no staff there - no one seemed to use it. The bar downstairs was quite nice - although the air con was at arctic level (and don't be fooled by the 2 for 1 cocktail deal - they double the prices to make up the difference!!). The crux of our disappointment was that the manager phoned us to tell us he was charging us for the taxi service anyway - we went mad and said there was no way we were paying for their incompentence of not confirming they would collect us. We argued about it and just refused to pay, they kept claiming they'd confirmed by email (the certainly hadn't!). Any hotel that niggles with a customer and questions their integrity is just not the hotel I want to stay in. We had booked a 2nd night on our return journey but naturally cancelled this. You can stay in the shangri la for just 3000 rp more and it is SOOOOOOO much better !!! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Service is Disappointing To be fair, the hotel accomodation is above average. It is their services that disappointed us. Our lugguages were accidentally directed to Mumbai by the time we arrived New Delhi. When we checked in this hotel around midnight, we advised the night shift staff about the Airlines arrangement of sending our lugguages back to our hotel, that is, Metropolitan, the next day. We also advised the receptionist to take a photocopy of the Airlines claim form to ensure everybody knew about this. Since we were heading for Agra early next morning and would not come back until 8:00 pm to pick up the lugguages for an onward flight to Singapore that night, we repeated our request by the time we checked out to avoid any mistake. Of course, you know the answer, there was no lugguage by the time we came back. At first, we thought it was the fault of the Airlines. But we later found out that the hotel staff turned down the Airlines delivery because we had already &quot;checked out&quot;! To add on, our request for one more bathrobe and slippers right after we checked in (the room had one set only, we had 2 persons) was never been fulfilled or being offered an explanation. Was it due to understaff or what? There was a high tendancy of long queue for checking in and checking out because only 2 receptionists were available. I definitely will not stay in this hotel for my next India visit. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Overpriced understaffed very average room. I arrived at the hotel at about 11pm and there was 1 person at reception dealing with 6 people while at the same time answering the phone. The same person was still doing everything at 6am the following morning when I checked out. It took half an hour to check in/out and for $300 a night they can afford more staff. The room was extremely average and not very nicely finished. Best avoided. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Great value for the money spent 4 nights at the Metropolitan and enjoyed every moment. My room (renovated on on the 4th floor) was spacious, clean and well equipped. Service was great (even when I ran out of mineral water at 1AM) and the staff was very attentive, polite and eager to assist. They have a no-tips policy which is great. Breakfast is good with selection (a bit limited though) of Indian and Western food.I ate at both the Chutney and Sakora restaurants of the hotel. Chutney provides excelent Indian food in relaxing atmosphere. Sakora was good too though I was a bit dissapointed with what I got but this has to do of course with my own selection and expectations.I will definitely make the Metropolitan my home while in Delhi!I booked through Expedia and got great rate of ~200$ 9excl. taxes) for a standard room incl. breakfast "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Absolutely thrilled with Metropolitan We had an opportunity of staying there twice, last month while touring North India.Lots of apprehension, while booking, as most of reviews were pretty negative. But, now we are wondering were we at the same Hotel, which we read about !!!Right from the start - Pick-up at the Airport - to the end, it was the most wonderful experience. Excellent service along with Indian art of hospitality.The Drivers were very professional and never honked . . . . someone metioned about Drivers expecting Tip. Interesting, as this is a &quot; No Tip &quot; hotel. The staff actually wear a Badge mentioning this.Space within the room was little tight . . . . but how can one complain when we had a roll-up bed for our son. The views of the Delhi skyline were just right with cloudy sky.Breakfast - Multi cuisines, reflecting the taste buds of their guests. Indian as well as Western dishes, changing every day.Business Lounge - Internet access and Happy Hour.Restuarant - Chutney. 200 chutneys to taste. Went through 18 of them in an evening. So we will be back for the remaining 182.Staff - Very professional. The personnel who managed Bell Desk were extraordinary. They did everything possible for our Baggage challenges.In summary, a wonderful experience enhanced by lovely attentive staff. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Price too high poor services I spent 3 nights in this hotel. The room was always too cold, every time I had a shower the bathroom was full of water, the sheets were torned. The edges of the pool were full of pigeons. When I did the check out I had to wait that my room was checked by an attendant (never happen to me). For these prices you can find something really better!! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"The best I've seen in India great staff and great location Hotels in Delhi are overpriced and dirty. This hotel was still a bit expensive, but worth it. I've been to Delhi 5 times and this was my favorite by far. The staff was VERY friendly and not intrusive like most highly rated hotels in Delhi. The breakfast was large and well done. The hotel was clean and well maintained. The room was a bit small but very comfortable. The best part perhaps was the location, it was within walking distance of the Palika Bazaar and Connaught, which made getting food outside of the hotel the easiest I've seen. If you're looking for high end in Delhi, I highly recommend this hotel. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Expensive but nice The hotel itself was somewhat reminiiscent of the days of the Raj. The actual grounds was not not huge but was pleasant. The swimming pool was adequate. Like all Delhi hotels, the price was high. The buffet offered a good selection. All in all, it was not an unpleasnat stay but nor was it particularly memorable for its staff or service. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Nice but expensive. This was my first hotel of three during my stay in India. It was twice the price of the other two and the bed was the most uncomfortable. The hotel itself is quite elegant. I didn't have the chance to avail myself of the spa facilities, but the main restaurant was excellent.My room was small, clean, and well appointed. The staff was very friendly, but also had their hand out for tips more than anywhere else I stayed. If you are looking for something a bit more upscale and don't mind paying for it I think you'll be very happy here. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good value for Delhi I stayed for 5 nights at the Metropolitan in New Delhi last week, and I was very satisfied.Firstly, I have to say that the rate was very good for Delhi. I paid just under 200 Euros (11500 rupees) per night, which is actually pretty reasonable for Delhi.The room was very comfortable - quite large, very clean and a separate bath and shower, which is always a nice bonus.I ate in the general restaurant and also in the Japanese restaurant, both have very good food and service. The bar is also very nice, if perhaps a little too &quot;trendy&quot;. I prefer the old bar.The pool area is very nice, although I didn't actually use the pool. The gym was great - full of brand new equipment with tv built into the eliptical cross trainers etc.Business center staff were very helpful, internet is very fast and not outrageously expensive (about 800 rupees per 24 hours).Location is very central, only 5 minute drive from Connaught Place, perhaps a 20 minute walk for the brave. All in all I was very happy with my stay and recommend the Metropolitan as a good business hotel.Just a final note. I have stayed in several Deli hotels over the last 4-5 years. Where I stay is always ultimately governed by the lowest rate available to me at a reasonable hotel. I have written other reviews about the Park and the Intercontinental The Grand, and have also stayed in the Sheraton, the Le Meridien and the Imperial. Overall, I would rate the Park and the Metropolitan at the bottom in terms of &quot;luxury&quot;, but they are also my first choice in Delhi since they both offer the best value for money in my opinion, since they are usually around 4000 - 5000 rupees cheaper per night than the others. If you get a better rate at the others, stay there, otherwise The Metropolitan and the Park are perfectly adequate. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good restaurant Stayed here 1-2 days. Hotel room very nice with good bathroom. Restaurant is excellent. Shuttle to the Airport also very good although driver overeggs the hints on how he needs tips to survive (- I'd say he's getting several times his monthly salary on tips!).Restaurant gave me complimemnetary bottle of water when I wanted to buy one fro trip to airport, and I extended my use of the room after checkout until 6pm at no charge - which was nice.Only problem area was reception where they were difficult to communicate with - I think their english was transactional, so that if everything routine fine, if not they had no clue and best option was to give up. I got food poisoning after a meal on Indian railways just before arriving at hotel. Extension to stay was required so I rang my Insurance to arrange. They rang hotel to arrange doctor visit and to confirm that they would pay bil for extra stays. Then Insurance rang me back to say that reception needed me to talk to them directly. So I called down immediately whereupon Reception denied that they ofr any of their colleagues had ever been speking to anyone. When filling in customer feedback on leaving I mentioned this and manager came out to say that they had been contacted but there was a miscommuinication. When I asked about the insurance compamny paying any extra bills they did not know anything about this. Easiest thing was to pay myself and claim back . Reception had no clue and had huge difficulty doing anything beyond basic - I half expected that the reason I'd been asked to call down originally was that they couln't understand the phone call and wanted a second try. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Pretty nice but overpriced I recently had a 3 night stay here and found the hotel rather nice. However, at $400 a night, it's definitely not a great value. The thing I found with India is that you either pay $40 and stay in a cesspit, or you plump for a hotel at upwards of $400 and get something nice but not nearly as outstanding as what you'd expect for the price. That aside, the staff (especially the the doormen) were so pleasant, welcoming and helpful. The hotel kind of had a faded imperial glory vibe to it, which gave it lots of charm and character. I found the beds way too hard, but the room was good overall and the breakfast buffet was enjoyable also. One problem (which I encountered a lot in Asia!) is that there was no ATM in the hotel. I would probably stay here again, just because of the warm and welcoming staff. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Disappointed with the Metropolitan I booked this hotel via a travel agent and pre-paid for a club room. I also pre-paid for transport to the hotel from the airport and back. The first problem was that the transport never arrived at the airport and when I called the hotel they informed me that they had not received details of my flight arrival. I found out later that this was not true. I have been to India a few times before which was fortunate as if this had been my first visit as a solo female traveller it would have been quite daunting to make my way to the hotel at 11pm on my own. When I arrived I was allocated a room that I discovered the following day was not a club room. I got onto the travel agent who contacted the hotel and were informed that I had definitely been allocated a club room. Again, not true. I was moved into a club room (right next to the lift, very noisy). Considering this was supposed to be 5 star luxury hotel it failed on several counts. I have stayed in several luxury 5 star hotels in India and this was well short of the mark. The air conditioning was freezing (even if turned up to 30C), the television had a terrible picture and none of the channels matched with the channel guide, the shower had a random spray and the hairdryer was broken. The staff were rude and unhelpful which was probably the worst thing. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted true 5 star luxury - stay at the ITC Sheraton, the Taj or the Oberoi. There is also now a nice looking Crowne Plaza in Gurgaon which is handy for the business district in New Delhi and near the airport. This hotel should reduce it's exorbitant prices and call itself a 4 star hotel, which is what it is. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Very nice I was able to get a good rate for this hotel via Expedia (at a big discount from the rack rate and the rate I was quoted by a travel agency), and it proved to be a very nice choice. The check-in process went quite smoothly and quickly. My room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, and it overlooked the swimming pool. The staff was very courteous and efficient, and I enjoyed the breakfast in the cafe.There are a few things, though, that prevent me from giving this hotel an &quot;excellent&quot; rating. First, there was no room service menu in the room. Now this turned out not to be a huge issue for me as I decided to go out for my meals, but the menu should have been there. Second, when I checked out the hotel didn't have enough rupees to give me change. By the time I stayed at the Metropolitan I had encountered the change issue numerous times, but I expect an establishment of this caliber to absorb the 2 or 3 rupee difference rather than shortchange me. When I protested that they were cheating me, they did absorb the difference, but I don't think I should have had to argue the point.Third, and most seriously, during my stay there was construction work being done on the pool. This didn't bother me in and of itself as I had no plans to take a dip during my stay. However, the construction was going on as late as 11:30 at night. To the hotel's credit, when I called at 11:30 and complained, the noise stopped within 10 minutes. But again, this should not have been necessary. And besides that, they started up again before 8 the next morning.Overall, though, my stay was pleasant, and I would stay here again. One tip: Metropolitan is the new name of the hotel. It was formerly called the Nikko, and that is the name taxi and tuk-tuk drivers are familiar with. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Lack of Communication We stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi on two occasions in November 2007. The first was an overnight prior to flying to Kathmandu for a few days. I was part of a group of friends and altogether we had 7 rooms. My first night's room was fine and my only criticism was the incredibly long time it took to check in and check out. Others in our group asked to be moved that night due to a hotel wedding that was still going strong at 11PM but my room was quiet. Another reported problems with their room where the toilet flush button fell off the wall and where the &quot;closet&quot; in the bathroom was clearly under construction with only a primer coat of paint and looked awful. When we returned some four days later I got assigned that room! The walls were freshly painted and smelled. There was no art on the walls and the room was clearly in the process of a remodel but was being rented anyway. The closet was still incomplete and the toilet flush button fell off the wall the first time I pushed it. I attempted to use the room safe and found it on a bottom shelf of a cabinet freely movable, i.e. not hooked up to anything, not anchored and with no directions. I assumed it was not working and when I reported all of these problems someone came to the room and showed me how to use the safe--but not how to keep someone from simply carrying it out of the room. Someone fixed the toilet flush button that should have been fixed when reported by the earlier occupant. No one would explain why the closet was incomplete or why the room was being rented while in the process of a remodel. On checkout the process was again very lengthy. I reported having consumed one item from the snack bar two days prior to departure and they had me wait while someone went to the room to inventory the bar, something that should have been done the previous day. My biggest problem with the hotel was that despite their apparent desire to be helpful I had the impression that there was a cultural gap and they had no concept of why I was unhappy since they brushed aside each and every complaint as insignificant although they did eventually fix most problems. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Definitely not 5 star Overpriced and not a 5 star hotel.Staff are friendly and helpful and that is all.Given a chance i will try other central hotels. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"great value we arrived in delhi after a very long flight, and not knowing what to expect, having left the madness of the entry roads. what we found was a lovely hotel, with a great atmosphere, helpful staff(as all over india). nothing was any trouble. it had 3 seperate restaurants and a seperate bar (very trendy) -we tried all bar the japanese retaurant (price and time) were factors. we spent 3 nights here, and was unable to find a complaint. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"NOT 5 star hotel or service Arrived quite late around 9.30 pm. We were booked for 3 persons for for 2 nights in a delux room. Room had twin beds only so they said they would have to put in an extra bed. Looked at the room and agreed it was too small for an extra bed and argued such. They said all rooms were same size and that the hotel was full, they had no where to move us too. In order to accommodate the extra bed, they had to take out the table and 2 chairs meaning we had nowhere to sit but on the beds. No room for luggage either, we each had 2 suitcases each which we had to put on the floor, so no room to move around the room without climbing over cases. They said that most people do not come with so much luggage!! I don't consider 1 large case and 1 flight bag each much luggage. The manager dealing with us was rude and unaccommodating, even walking off in mid sentance to speak to another customer leaving us frustrated. So as it was late we had to make do. No offer of anything complementary to make up for our dissapointment in the room or service even though we made our feelings quite clear.As it was late we ate in the buffet restaurant, food was lukewarm. They had the nerve to charge 450 rupees for service charge. This was a self service meal! Buffet breakfast however was good.Manager rude and staff unhelpfull. Would definitely not stay there again. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Just OK for the category This is a five stars hotel, so it is quite normal that it is clean and comfortable. However, there is something cheerless in it - the hall has a strange smell and lighting does not favour it. Rooms are OK, but you might find just the same in a four stars hotel in Europe. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Great Location - Shame about the View The Nikko is one of Delhi's better centrally located hotels {I've stayed in most of them}. The only downside is the view - if you face the back onto the pool you have a green park infront but its dark and lacks sunlight. If you stay in a &quot;City Facing&quot; room it looks onto the Delhi's skyline - but you can't see much although rooms are a lot brighter.The Hotel is clean and the staff are atentive although it takes three of them to do one job. The Buffet breakfast and Lunch are very good and the Sakura Japanese restuarant is fab if you can afford it. The Zen Spa is excellent - the steam rooms are the best I have ever sat in and the gym is well equipped and air conditioned.The hotel is within walking distance of Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and a short drive from Birla Mandir and the shopping in Connaught Place/Janpath/Karol Bagh.If your looking for a five star deluxe where you can spend all day walking around the property (why) - the Nikko is not for you - but if your like most tourists/business travellers who eat breakfat and maybe dinner there and spend all day out - its a perfect well maintained oasis.Its known by Delhi-ites as the Japanese Hotel - with lower and harder beds but with good marbled bathrooms and seperate shower cubicles.This was my third stay at the Metropolitan Nikko and I will be coming back. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Okay only Stayed one night when I reached Delhi on 7th July 2007 and needless to say I don't like the hotel. It is quite old. The reception area has this strange odor that gave you a creepy feeling.Room: We had the deluxe and it was a standard room. Again, I can tell that this hotel needs renovation to fulfill it as a 5 star place.Breakfast: It has nice varieties, tried authentic Indian food for the first time, too hot for my taste.In all, for the price that you pay, better stay at Le Meridien, because this place needs a face lift. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good hotel for Delhi not the greatest location get a good rate Good hotel part of the Nikko hotel chain. Great restaurants, Japanese and Indian. Excellent breakfast buffet...get it included in the rate.New spa and gym, up to date range of excercise machines.Wireless internet access expensive, around 25 USD for 24 hrs which run consecutively. Nice size pool, very hot and not too many pool chairs. Good business meeting facilities.Helpful friendly staffBeware if you prepay, you can't get a refund, or if you wish to leave early, no refund on rest of stay.Neighbourhood leaves something to be desired but walked there safely at midnight to Connaught place, although hotel said it might be dangerous..not recommended for sole walkers or women, take a taxi or rickshaw.Taxi can be arranged from airport, 33 USD prepay to hotel room, local taxis can be had for cheaper but it is nice to be met after your long international flight. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Weird Luxury I stayed here for 3 nights while on a tour of India. I thought it was nice enough, with an excellent breakfast, but I would probably not recommend it to others. The hotel property itself is small and claustrophobic. The gym is nice, though. It is near Connaught Place, but in a strange neighborhood. Having seen what slums in India look like I would not say it is in a slum, but it is hard to walk out of the hotel without being surrounded by beggars. I stayed at another hotel - Le Meridien - at the end of my trip, and this was not the case. No one will hurt you or anything, but it is uncomfortable. It's worth it to spend a few more bucks and get a better location. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Good but no atmosphere This was a clean, comfortable 5 star hotel but it really lacked atmosphere - we were the only people in the restaurant at lunchtime, the pool side was empty and when we called into the bar in the evening it was brightly lit and the air conditioning was up way too high to make you want to relax and have a few drinks! We were originally going to stay at The Imperial but it didn't get great reviews. However we had dinner at The Imperial that night instead of The Nikko and we wished we'd stayed there instead - the bar was great - full of old world charm and the food in the Indian restaurant was really good (the Thai restaurant was fully booked). The Imperial seemed to be far more busy in general and had a much better atmosphere. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Clean comfortable convenient hotel Stayed at the Nikko for two nights in Feb 2007. This stay was the last leg of our India trip and we wanted a little bit of luxury after having stayed in cheap hotels/ with family. Check-in staff were extremely courteous and efficient. Rooms were of good size and the power shower was fantastic (we'd gotten used to the bucket and mug routine!!). Lots of TV channels for when we just wanted to veg out during our last day.Location-wise, couldn't more be more convenient. Only a 10-15 minutes walk to Cannaught Place. Being part of a Japanese chain, there was a Japanese restaurant in the hotel which was pretty good. The main restaurant menu was a little unimaginative though. Also, there were only two PC's in their Business Centre. I had to wait almost 2 hours to get a computer so that I could check-in online. But on the whole it was a very pleasant stay indeed and would choose this hotel again the next time I'm in Delhi. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Calm introduction to India We chose this hotel specifically because it is a Japanese business hotel, and we got what we expected. Our room was a good size, clean, nothing overly spectacular, but it was a gentle introduction to the madness of India (we had only got married 36 hours previously so didn't want anything too full on). We did find the service on reception at the travel desk a little slow, but this is India so it wasn't really surprising, although we found the staff in general to be friendly. Both restaurants were good, and we thought the location was good - not quite in the thick of it all, but pretty central. The Sikh temple down the road is brilliant, a real oasis of calm in a mad city.Other reviewers have said that the hotel itself and the restaurants are expensive, but business hotels are expensive - ok, so you don't get a true taste of India at the Hotel Nikko but it doesn't pretend to be either a cheap or 'authentic' option. And as for overlooking slums (which I think is a little extreme anyway) - India is an extremely poor country so not really a surprise, is it? "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Very Pleasant Stay I was not sure what to expect when I booked this hotel because of the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor. The hotel photographs of the exterior on their website were not particularly impressive either.I was pleased to find the hotel to be a good quality four to five star standard. The room was very comfortable and spotless with a very nice bathroom. The beds were a little firm for my taste. The food was first class. My wife did not like the dish she selected in Tuskar bar and the manager changed it immediately without any fuss.Service in the restaurant and from the concierge was above average. Location is central with a short taxi ride to Connaught Place. We enjoyed the Japanese singing group in Tuskar bar also.The only downside was the view from the back of the hotel which is of a poor residential area. I would recommend this hotel. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Nice hotel but not a 5 star We stayed in different cities of India during 15 days and all the hotels where we stayed were 4/5 star hotels.Our flight was delayed 4 hours and reached the hotel at 10 in the night, since we had paid our room in advance we had absolutely no problem at all. It's a good 30 minutes drive from the airport to the hotel.The Lobby was very clean and looked very nice and new. From the lobby you could see the pool, the bar and the Sakura japanese restaurant.The room was a bit small and the bed was more a japanese style (extremely hard for my back). The bathroom was very small. My wife could only come in the bathroom while I was in the shower, if not there was no space for both of us. On the whole, the room was clean.I have no doubt the Sakura restaurant is one of the best Japanese restaurants in India, but it is also very very expensive.Service at the hotel was very kind and helpful, but be aware if you plan to rent a car to go around the city. We got the same car and service outside the hotel at a travel agency for 1/3 of the price.Location of the hotel is excellent, very near Connaught Place. But it's not walking distance! You can take a Riksha from outside the hotel and will charge you 10 Rs.On the whole it's a nice hotel, but not worth the value and of course not a 5 star. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Great start to India We chose the Nikko from a short list of 4-5star hotels from thetripadvisor site and spent our first three days in Delhi at the Nikko before joining a group tour.From the minute we were saluted by the regal doormen everything was perfect.The room was furnished in traditional style and was very cleanand comfortable,the service was attentive and timely.The meals were good with the waiters very friendly,the buffets were excellent especially the Saturday night seafood feast.The foyer was stunning and the elephant backdrop in the main bar was beautiful.In retrospect the Nikko was the best hotel we experienced during our 15 day stay in India which included luxury palaces and forts.We were told that the in-house restaurants particularily the Japanese were expensive but the main dining room was very good value.Would definately recommend this hotel. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,Lobby looks nice- but that is all We booked a few weeks in advance-standard room at 175/night-US dollars.This seems high but there are not too many high end names to chose from. Our room was horrible- smelled like cats lived in it-carpet was worn- beds were really low to the ground and worn also. Lighting was really low-probably because they don't want you to see how rundown it is in the rooms. We arrived late and were only there for the night so decided to buck up and not complain. Maybe we had a really outdated room- but if that is the case that is not nice on the hotels part- the hotel was not full. Lobby was nice- but that is all I can say. 
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Greatly disappointed I was greatly disappointed in this so-called 5* deluxe hotel. I shopped high and low on the internet for about 5 months prior to booking. At that time, the reviews on the NIkko were superb, and being a huge family reunion from all corners of the world (NY, UK &amp; Papua New Guinea), it was going to be something special. Or so I thought!The hotel itself is nowhere a 5*. Yes, it is clean and has 'crisp' interiors, but the rooms were disappointing with stains on the carpets and some of the tiling grout coming off in the bathrooms. The door keys were another issue altogether! I had to go down to reception 5 times because my door key didnt work and they had to reprogramme it. The restaurants were averade except for Sakura which i give 9/10. The patio served some sorry excuse for sandwiches. Quite poor really, considering this is supposed to be a 5* deluxe hotel.The door staff were courteous and friendly. I cannot fault them. The reception staff however, were another issue. They did not seem to go out of their way to make the stay memorable. Instead we got many blank looks when we asked for any help/advice regarding the shops/city. I have travelled a lot and for the money that we paid for a 5 night stay (£680!!!), I was so so disappointed. On our last day, we went to the airport at the crack of dawn, pnly to find out our flight was cancelled and the airport staff told us that they had left a message with the person at the Nikko reception. You got it! They didnt bother to let us know. This I thought was disgraceful, and highlighted the total lack of hospitality. For a Japanese chain of hotel, this experience left me cold. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Overpriced but otherwise fine My wife and I spent a total of 4 nights here in November 2006 as part of our Golden Triangle tour. The hotel is modern, clean and comfortable. Our room was very nice. However, this hotel is overpriced. Two years ago, we stayed at the Meridien which (at that time, we haven't been there since) was very nice with a much nicer location, i.e. not surrounded by slum conditions. The Japanese restaurant boasted rave reviews. The food was good, but the atmosphere was so-so, made worse by the fact that smoking is allowed.We enjoyed the buffet restaurant at breakfast. The selection was good and the food tasty. We had the supper buffet and it was excellent. We especially enjoyed the range of salads and the cheese plate. The desserts were excellent.The business centre charges 300 rupees for 30 minutes of internet use (about $10 Canadian)- what!!?? The look on my face when the clerk told me that prompted some sympathy and she gave me 10 minutes free just to check my email. Find an internet cafe in Connaught Place.The staff at the travel desk were not helpful. We wanted to go to a shopping mall. After considerable discussion about what a shopping mall was (remember, this hotel caters to lots of western tourists so we couldn't be the first ones to request this), the clerk recommended &quot;a mall&quot; 20 minutes away and offered to arrange a car for us. The hotel car would cost 2,500 rupees for one hour. Yes, that's two thousand, five hundred rupees. We said we would get a taxi and he gave a little performance about how that might not be safe, etc. We took the taxi and it cost only 300 rupees round trip. However, when we arrived at the &quot;mall&quot;, it was just a department store with 3 floors and nothing to recommend it. Not impressed.The health club/fitness room was not available due to renovations. I read a review from August that indicated the same thing. This must be one heck of a renovation they're doing to last for 5 months.There was one fellow from the housekeeping staff who was a real nuisance. He was very friendly but was obviously angling for a tip. Whenever he would see us returning to our room, he would knock on the door &quot;to see if everything was alright&quot;. This seemed like attentive service for the first few times, but then it became annoying. He would offer us &quot;evening turndown service&quot; at 3 in the afternoon. This is a clean, comfortable hotel located close to Connaught Circle. However, it is overpriced for what it offers and the location is not attractive. I would definitely look elsewhere if I visit again. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Expensive and not worth the money The room and hotel were both nice, clean and well equipped.Staff were not particularly friendly.After being told breakfast was being served until 10:30am (I think) staff refused to serve us the breakfast buffet at 10:15. We were just told this had finished.Location is poor in my opinion. Its not within walking distance to anything. Taxis are cheap in Delhi but if you're going to get taxis/rickshaws (most of whom had not heard of this hotel) then why pay for a central location which is what this hotel partly sells itself on.Worst complain...our room at the back of the hotel overlooked the pool area which was used for functions on both nights of our weekend stay. This was very noisy and particularly irrating to us, who with jet lag, also had a 7am train to catch.I would stay here again but only if someone else were paying the bill. This hotel is comfortable but has no features that justify the price tag. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Just OK...Service wasn't very impressive This hotel had a good clean room...and sitting on the comfortable bed, I couldn't really tell if I was in India or New York without either watching the TV or looking out the window. My room (King Bed) was 18.5K Rupees (or $400+/night) which I just didn't think it was worth the expense. Internet access was over $22/night. Still, all of the other five-star hotels were booked and they generally had a similar cost so obviously they are doing something right. I also stayed at the Hotel Sri Nanak Continental which was $100/night without all of the extravagance and would probably do that again if I could do it all over again. Still, this is a good business class hotel that caters towards westerners who have an expense account...and they fit this need pretty well.My only issues were around the service in the hotel dining room and at their snack/coffee bar...it just wasn't very good, which surprised me given the cost and prior reviews. I coulnd't figure out why...as just paying attention to your table/customers is pretty basic. You softof feel like just a number, versus a guest of the hotel. The Bell staff, front desk were all helpful and competent.Room service was excellent...nothing like some spaghetti bolognese when you miss western food. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Be Careful of Rip Offs We stayed at this Hotel twice on our 'Golden' Triangle trip, at the beginning and also at the end of the tour and after the first stay had wished we didnt have to stay again on the way back. Nearing the end of October 2006 we stayed here.Even though nothing was majorly wrong with this hotel little things happened to make us not enjoy our stay. Our group of four people had two rooms one as a double the other as twin room, the first stay was fine we had the standard (or so we thought) deposit of 10,000 rupees. We arrived late so headed to the bar for some drinks, we ordered four drinks one of which was a coffee and they charged us over 3000 rupees as we were tired and disorientated we did not say anything, but looking back at this we know we were ripped off by the bar staff because we didnt receive a drinks menu to know the cost of each drink, and also they never printed us a receipt they just verbally told us how much the drinks came to. We were at fault here not to question this but my advice to anyone is to make sure they print a receipt for you or at least ask for a drinks menu so you know how much each drink is. As when we stayed the second time i did get a drinks menu and receipt so seems that the staff were trying to rip us off previously!Our second visit when we arrived we were charged 20,000 rupees this time for deposit which obviously is refunded back to you but we found it bizarre that we had only stayed 5 days previously and our deposit had been doubled. The twin room was ready but we were told this was the double room went all the way upstairs with the bell boy to then realise it was for the other people in our party, we then had to wait over 40 mins for the double room to be ready, which we were just told to wait in reception. The double room this time we were shown was absolutely freezing inside from the air con, it was that cold you could see your breath, we complained that when you leave your room the air con comes on automatically and is set at a certain temp which you cannot adjust unfortunately for that room it was on freezing!! We asked if we could just simply have the air con turned off when we were not in the room this seemed to cause a big problem and scratching of heads. Im positive we cant have been the only people ever to ask this but it took 5 times of asking then demanding to speak to manager before eventually they turned off our air con altogether so we had none but this was a damn sight better than not being able to sleep because your soo cold.The carpets in both rooms were dirty. We did not try the japenese resturant but we did have breakfast on both occasions and we could not fault it.If we were ever to return to Delhi I would not stay at this hotel again as too expensive for the service you receive and staff were not very friendly or courteous and also will try to make a quick buck out of you! "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"OK... but not worth the price. Spent a week at the Nikko Metropolitan Delhi in October. While I would not be as harsh in my overall rating, I definitely agree with the previous review. The hotel is nice enough but really nothing special. However, where I felt the staff could have made up for the neutral surroundings they only added to my disappointment. I too found the staff to be, at best aloof, at worst rude. Upon checking in, no one offered to tell me anything about the hotel or show me around. On my fifth day, my room key card did not work. On going to the desk I was told that my room charges had exceeded the authorization they took when I checked in so my room was locked until they could take another authorization. On checking out no one even bothered to ask if I enjoyed my stay. My $330.00 a night room did indeed look out on what can best be described as a slum. The room itself was small-ish, the bathroom was quite nice, the mattress was Japanese style (which means HARD). The pool was nice but most of the time there was no attendant and I had to practically track someone down every time I wanted to order a drink or some food. Overall, my experience was neutral. I know that there is a shortage of good hotels in Delhi and they are priced accordingly however, I couldn't help but feel that I could have stayed someplace with warmer and more inviting atmosphere for the price. I don't think I would select to stay at the Nikko Metropolitan again. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Too expensive and unfriendly We were greeted in the nikko by very unfriendly, arrogant staff. Our room looked out on a place that is used by the people as an &quot;open air&quot; toilet. The rooms are too expensive for what they are. After our trip we wanted to come back to this hotel but had to reschedule our return flight and therefore had to cancel two of four nights we intended to stay. Following this the hotel doubled its room rates. So we annulled our booking and went to another place. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"overpriced We have stayed in Delhi for two days in the Metropolitan nikko hotel, after having spent several days in Agra. It was our first trip to India. I do not know how it compares to other hotels in Delhi, but this hotel is way overpriced: the rate was 300 $ a night for a very small room (when compared to the sheraton in Agra), the wood furniture was old and smelled as such, carpet smelled of dust. The staff was very nice, attentive and curteous and the lobby was a 5 star lobby. Did not try the restaurant, but the breakfast was excellent too. Delhi and India in general is a tricky country to visit since the hotel is quite luxurious but when you come out of it, it is quite a different story (including the neighboourhood around the Metropolitan). The only area in Delhi that looked clean and without people sleeping on the street was the Diplomatic quarters. Did not see the hotels there though. A little far from the center also, but taxis are cheap. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Great Stay The Nikko was our first hotel on our Golden Triangle trip. This hotel provided excellant service, food and accomodation. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"Great hotel in the heart of the city This hotel is clean, comfortable and convenient to the airport. The staff was courteous and took time to make sure we had what we needed. I would stay there again if we returned to Delhi. "
the metropolitan hotel new delhi ,"The Personnel At This Hotel Were a Pain in the B*** Where to begin. Everytime that I order room service, I am asked if I will pay cash. No, I reply, I will bill it to the room. Everytime that I use the services in the business center, the girls there ask me if I will pay cash. No, I reply, I will bill it to the room. I talked to the travel desk on the first floor, to see if I could depart from Delhi a few days early. The answer was no, all flights were booked. I was accosted, (seriously), by a gentleman from the registration desk, asking me when I was checking out. I looked at him, and then I told him that when I was ready to check out, that I would so inform him. I had reserved my room for over a week, but he seemed in a panic that I might check out early. It got worse. When I got to my room, I found that my room key no longer worked. I had to go to the front desk, tell them, and wait for then to reprogram the key card. I called guest services with a simple request for a roll of tape. It took hours, and multiple follow up calls, for this to happen. I just remembered that I called and asked for a pair of AAA batteries. They never came. When I set the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on the door, the housekeeping boy insisted on ringing the bell at 10AM to enquire when I would like him to clean the room. I informed him that I would call for housekeeping when I needed it. This happened for three days in a row, until I got angry and admonished him, telling him that if the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; light was activated, that he should truly not disturb me. It happened again, anyway, the afternoon of the fourth day of my stay. A girl from the front desk came up with a security guard. Apparently they thought that I was dead, or using drugs, or something. I was in the shower, and they actually opened my door. Unbelievable. In case you are wondering, I am traveling on a corporate credit card, I wear business suits, I am well-groomed, and very presentable. The service in this hotel is bizarre. I will never return here. The restaurants are hit-or-miss. They make excellent soups. The beef in the Japanese restaurant is superb. The buffet in Patio, their ground floor cafe, blows. The sandwiches laid out there are soggy and sad. Great desserts, but sickening coffee. They will bring you cream for your coffee, however. You just have to clarify it no fewer than three times to the waiter. Laundry service is good. Room service likes to bring you a miniature bottle of Evian rather than a large bottle of Himalayan mineral water, apparently because they can charge extortionate prices for it. And since we are talking about water, the waiters have a strange habit of showing you a bottle of water like it is a bottle of fine wine, asking if it meets your approval. I just look at them and tell them that I would like water. Bottled water. Whatever they have is fine. At $182 a night, I will not be returning. Especially after I went to dinner at the Hotel Shangrila. I will be staying there for my next trips to Delhi. The Metropolitan Hotel is a step up from the Crowne Plaza, but it dearly needs help. This is the second ostensibly &quot;five star&quot; hotel in New Delhi that was comparable to a Holiday Inn in the USA. Oh, yeah. One more thing: the health club is closed. They are refurbishing it. So, there is no gym here. Avoid unless you like to be harassed by the employees, who mostly mean well, but just do not get it. "

the muse hotel ,"Well kept place but far from action (other then Baha'i temple) Despite the poor reviews this place is overall a very decent place to stay in Delhi. They cater more to business travelers, but can also take good care of regular tourists. THe breakfast is nice and the rooms are well kept, clean, up to date, and comfortable. The room service is tasty but not cheap. "
the muse hotel ,"PMP Training Recently, i joined a course of PMP Training, tpo be provided by Evayaa Gnosis. that was a 4 day training from 9:00AM to 6:00 PM. I had a bad experience of this hotel.Services and food quality are poor. Even, when you know in your hotel there is some training, you shoulld not disturb the conference room. but there construction/ modification work was going on.THAK.. THAK .. (very much sound.. Terrible)even after aksing to the manager too many times he did not stopped the work. while after 6:00 PM if calss is running upto 7 PM then they are worried and disturb the class, like please vacate the place as your time is over.So their behaviour was so rude..this is not the hotel to go for any stay or conferenec or training...please avoide "
the muse hotel ,"UNPROFESSIONAL NOT RECOMMENDED We booked a few rooms for our clients in January 2009. We canceled one room 4 days prior to arrivals and requested for our money back. The General Manager through his mails confirmed that the refunds would be sent back in 7 days. We are still waiting for refunds and there seems no possibility that our Money is coming back. Absolutely Unprofessional, Rude and Selfish Management!! "
the muse hotel ,"Avoid !! 1. Upon arrival we discovered that the magnetic card machine was out of order and had to be taken to our rooms using the master card key. This was an inconvenience.2. The main passenger lift was mostly out of order during our stay. This was a major inconvenience.3. The stair well was ill lit.4. Front desk staff will guide you towards rent a car's at four times the fare, rather than advising on where to find a taxi. 5. Bathrooms are too small and the shower stalls are badly, almost dangerously, designed; which allows water to stream out and make the whole bathroom wet and slippery.6. They don't check their emails very often, so don't ask your office to forward any messages to them. They do check their fax machine, but good luck sending a fax to India. 7. You'll be cheated on the money exchange rates. Any 5 star hotel's change counter will give you a rate over 10% better. 8. The hotel has not replied to my written comments. "
the muse hotel ,"Good value good location I find international business hotels in India to be outrageously priced for what you get. The Muse is a reasonably priced alternative in a good location. The rooms are modern and clean. Breakfast and Wifi are complimentary. On the whole the staff and friendly and helpful. Yes, it doesn't have the facilities of an international hotel and the finish can sometimes be slightly rough on the edges... but for quick business trips it is fine. I will stay here again on my next trip to India. "
the muse hotel ,"Perfect for a short and comfortable stay in Delhi We stayed in the Muse for one night as part of our tour of India. I had previously been to India 10 years ago and I was really apprehensive of my stay. The Muse was the first hotel we stayed in as part of our Golden Triangle tour and I was worried for no reason.The hotel is very modern for Indian standards and it looks more like a boutique hotel I would find in Europe, I have to say I was impressed.Upon reaching the hotel, the doorman opened the door for us which was a pleasant surprise, we were taken to the coffee shop and offered cold drinks whilst we were checked in.We had a triple room and it was spacious for all of us and our bags. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have had in India and the shower was divine. The only thing I would mention and this is probably for the ladies, there is no mirror next to a power point, so this made straightening my hair a bit of a challenge. This is a minor point though, overall i thought the hotel was fantasitc value and good base to see Delhi from. "
the muse hotel ,"Muse: a credible alternative to pricey hotels I stayed recently at the Muse. Very modern. Courteous staff. Efficient front desk. Free wifi and breakfast. About 16-18 kms from the airport in Nehru Place. It may be a bit far out if you are traveling to Lodhi Road or its neighbourhood but if you plan the day it is a minor inconvenience. The room that I stayed had a king bed. It was spacious, delightfully clean, no murky smelling carpet, with plentiful lights, flat TV, in room safe and plasma TV. Was there a refrigerator&gt; I am not sure. The bathroom has a great shower area (I felt relieved it did not have a tub), speckless marble walls and floor. The room looked and felt better than most renovated 5***** hotels in New Delhi. Beware though that those who only stay in those hotels may not feel pleased to stay here, but those who are looking for short stays, in an exceptionally clean and comfortable room will find this a deal. You can reach the hotel directly via email reservation @musedelhi.com or through their website. "

the park new delhi ,"Avoidable like all Park Properties Like most Park Hotels, this one is full of noisy teenagers and over dressed local people.The hotel website is three times more expensive than any online agent would offer.I would suggest, avoid this so called brand. "
the park new delhi ,"just dont stay there We arrived at Park Hotel at 18.00 on a Friday and we were just shocked. Since we are hoteliers, we asked for an upgrade and they provided us with the super luxurious room which had GLASS WALLS between the bathroom and the room. As you can imagine i could hear everything that was happenning in the bathroom....the bed linen were full of hair stuck on them...the bathroom was very dirty...a lot of hair on the floor and the bathtub...also there was no hand shower..so the water was only coming from the top..breakfast was ok...a lot of variety but still it looked a bit dirty again maybe because my mind was on the hair i found on the bed..the restaurant was fine too. In general this is not a 5 star hotel for me! I have a 3 star hotel in Greece and it s far better than this..just UNACCEPTABLE!!! "
the park new delhi ,"Please find another place... This is NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel - maybe, just barely, a good 3 star. The rooms are very small, the hotel looks well worn, the meals at the restaurants are much-much-much too expensive - as are the drinks at the bar (close to $20 for a shot of scotch - please!). On top of this the room rates are way over priced. I paid close to $230 for a room that should have gone for about half that. Beware, the photos on the web site look good, but do not tell the true story. In Italian we would call it a &quot;bella figura&quot; - in English it would be called putting a good face on ****. I also found the staff to be too pushy. On the good side - the rooms are clean, the upper floors are very quiet, and there is a good selection of breakfast foods. "
the park new delhi ,"Overpriced and overhyped Though not quite as unbearably trendy as its siblings in Chennai and Bengaluru, this establishment is not the right place for a serious working traveller to stay - certainly not at the price charged. Go a bit further from the centre of Delhi and you can get much better value. The room was the smallest &quot;five star&quot; room I've ever encountered, and the bed far from being king size was an ordinary 4'6&quot; double. No fruit, no biscuits, no newspapers. Showering was an exciting experience as the water changed by itself from too hot to too cold with a 9 second cycle. Despite many people being in the dining room well before 7 a.m. (the breakfast start time) there was no effort to speed things up and the two waiting staff were already overwhelmed by the time 7 o'clock arrived. Just sliced bread available, no other breads or pastries. I suggested when I checked out that they respond to the clear needs of their customers for an earlier breakfast but it was brushed aside. If you have to stay there, get a room near the top of the building well away from the awful noise of 'music' from the disco late into the night. I will not be returning. "
the park new delhi ,"OK lot of scope for improvement Having previously stayed at The Park in Kolkata I was eager to visit the Delhi version. Located right in the heart of the city The Park had nothing much to offer. I would rather call it a building with a bar, a bakery and a discotheque with some rooms.The rooms are ordinary, the staff and the front desk personnel behaved in a very snobbish way. For once I regretted coming here. The staff seemed more interested in entertaining the guests at the Bar and the discotheque rather than the room guests.The only thing like able was the Flury's bakery, their coffee and cakes were just yummy and made me forgot the other negative points. I would only recommend it to people who want to walk around in Connaught Place and central Delhi. "
the park new delhi ,"Please when can I go back ? Delhi can be hectic and demanding. The choice of hotel is really important in this part of India , and I am glad to have found The Park. Its brilliant and I would definitely include this hotel on any of my return visits to India . The interior design is very groovy, but not cold. The service and smiles have not been painted over in the decorating effort. The restaurant at the hotel is pricey but briliant. The food is contemporary Indian with odd and unusual splashes from all regions with modern appreciations. Service spectacular. The pool side is really relaxing. Make sure you indulge daily in the breakfast on the ground floor. "
the park new delhi ,"Not worth it. Stayed a week at this hotel. The experience was average at best. You know that something is wrong when your asked to wait in the lobby for breakfast. And then made to share a table with someone because &quot;we are busy.&quot;The place lacks the service of a top hotel, and clearly is a business thats more focused on quantity, rather than providing quality. Simply, dont bother staying here. "
the park new delhi ,"Very average experience- highly priced - low value 1. The car for airport transfer was dirty and very ordinary. The price charged for airport trasfer was around Rs 2000 incl tax one way..The driver's mobile kept ringing all the way from airport to hotel..2. I was the only person checking in..yet thefront desk staff kept insisting I sit down.,. whe you have a long flight you dont want to sit down , you just want to go ahead to your room..low sensitivity..3. The corridors of the hotel rooms were in very poor state - 3rd Floor ..had chipped off tops , lots of finger marks etc'4. The room as such was somewhat of a saving grace..though small yet well appointed...housekeeping in room was good5. The bar is overhyped and over priced6. The Indian food was great ..ordered room ervice and was delicious7. Breakfast was a mess next morning...toast service is vertually not there and there are large queues for toast..Overall very average...for the price paid...I will look another hotel next time "
the park new delhi ,"only 3 star We where dissappointed. The design is excellent but the hotel is already 10 years old.The carpets in rooms and corridors are old and overused. Windows where not clean, only one elevator working. In the restaurant you feel like in a students canteen not in a 5* hotel. Many groups. And at the end they tried to charge one night twice. Rather 3 - 4 * Receptionstaff to young and not experienced. "
the park new delhi ,"Terrible Very Rude Staff Poor Cleanliness Don't Waste Your Money We were travelling with kids and an older parent. Throughout our stay we had several bad experiences, which you wouldn't expect to find with this kind of hotel. You do not get the service expected, for the kind of money you pay. 1) First there were flies on food at the buffet area every day, flying over all open food items. The staff at the buffet area was not very attentive. 2) We got human hair in food three times during our stay. 3) The water from the flush was black, which caused concern of falling sick, if the same water came from the shower, and if we swallowed it. 4) The rooms were unclean too. The rug was dirty and stained. 5) The phone would start ringing at early hours (5 am) and disturbed our sleep, this happened twice, among the 2 nights we were there. It turned out the phone quipment was faulty. This actually ruined our sight seeing visit next day. 6) My father found a scorpion like insect in his room; he had to call staff member to fumigate the room. 7) Above all, when we requested that our parent and kids sit in the reception/lounge area for an hour and half, after we had checked out, while we got some work done. We were refused outright and they were very rude. We could have ordered a drink or food and just left them there, but we were courteous in asking them first, yet we were not treated in kind. Considering their poor hospitality, we wondered if they would have just kicked them out? We reported all of above issues to management, however no courtesy was shown and no actions were taken.In the past, we have been to many five start resorts like Taj, ITC Moghul, etc. At any decent hotel, if there was any inconvenience, the senior management would take care of it in a courteous way. We would never visit any Park hotel in the future.&lt;/textarea&gt; "
the park new delhi ,"great experience and economical very good facilities ,clean and in the heart of city having market at walking distance. "
the park new delhi ,Not a 5 star hotel - maybe a 2 star! Bar outside played insanely loud music until 3 am which could be heard clearly throughout the room. Kept us awake all night. Thin walls - could hear people talking and even blowing their nose. Poor service - both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast selection - cold and lousy. Elevators broken and rooms really small. Would not stay there again! Awful experience. 
the park new delhi ,"Pleased with my stay.... Inspite of some bad reviews on the net, I took a chance and stayed at the park during my last trip to Delhi. Ive stayed at &quot;The park&quot; Calcutta on several occasions, where I found the room, service and food to be top notch - the prices were pretty spectacular too, I must add! The property in Delhi was pretty good and I guess if one is not familiar with the design &amp; service philospy of the park group - the rooms &amp; ambience might seem a tad strange. All the fittings in my room and bath were fine - i was really pleased that my room had atleast half a dozen plug points. "
the park new delhi ,"Ok I can't say too much good about this place, but not too much bad either. Our room was small but fine. The loud streets of Delhi are right out our window and pigeons were sitting on the ledge the whole time. That would be fine except the feathers actually were under the window and behind our bed. Not too sanitary if you ask me. Dogs barked all night on the street, you are in the middle of the city, you know? The restaurant was good, the Fire restaurant was excellent. Room service was really good one night as I had a falafel and hummous wrap, yummy! It's got a cool feel to it, but that's about it. The breakfast was nothing special and the staff were blah... Sorry I don't have much better to say. "
the park new delhi ,Not worth the money Dowdy room and bathroom.Very expensive restaurant.Pathetic staff uniforms. 
the park new delhi ,"mal-functioning and poor service upgrade to club level without all privileges. We had to pay for our Sula wine served in champagne flutes. No snacks.room somehow &quot;cheaply&quot; furnished despite on club level. rain shower very inefficiently working especially getting rid of shampoo and conditioner took ages. The water tempertaure could not be ajusted: remaining only hand-warm. The aircon could not be adhusted: either Hot or FREEZING. The hair blower had powercuts and was of no use at all.The packed breakfast (incl. in the rate and a necessity due to early check-out) consisted or one sandwhich and an apple!The hotel as a whole impressed through unfriendliness, lack of service and malfunctioning features in the room.I particularly disliked the &quot;design&quot; features in the room which were not comfortable at all: 2 tiny tables attached to the couch instead of a decent table which made room service dinner unpleasant.The hotel seemed somehow CHEAP from A to Z. "
the park new delhi ,"Funky glitzy Indian Five star One of the pretenders to being a great hotel in Delhi with an Indian twist.The decor is utterly modernistic (though not arty in my view) with the lobby full of glaring shades. However it just cant match the class of the Imperial or hotels like Intercontinetal at Barakhamba (Total business friendly), Claridges or even the Ashok (Excellent value for Money)The rooms are very small when compared to the large ones i have stayed at Intercon or Ashok.Everything else is quite good at part with any Five star though nothing home to write about. Would recommend this to anybody who has business at CP in delhi though Intercontinental is better in opinion.The &quot;Fire&quot; is a happening Nightspot and pool not heated. Gym is quite good and the staff polite and cultivated - a sea change from the ashok. "
the park new delhi ,"Love the disco-theque I was staying at The park at cannaught place many times. I find the hotel interrior is excellent &amp; good hospitality. They are having the very good break-fast, swimming pool &amp; pub. Try this. Restaurant is very expenssive. INR 2000 for one person minimum for good lunch or dinner. There are recption staff are not helping and asking 150 INR for one print which is unusual in India. Overall the stay was wonderfull. "
the park new delhi ,"Chic and stylish in a central location I'm a fan of The Park chain of properties in india, and The Park New Delhi demonstrates why.The hotel itself features stylish rooms, great service and an excellent location. Wining and dining on the property attracts the famous and not-so-famous wannabees to the range of bars and restaurants, but for the travellers i have to say that the food is some of the best I have found in any hotel in Delhi.The Park New Delhi offers a very contemporary take on Indian hospitality - and one which I am always happy to accept when I am in the city. "
the park new delhi ,ananda spa himalayas stop over it is meant to be a 5 star holiday but is more like 3-4 star more 3 star... rooms are clean and pretty basic - the tea making faicilities are in big round brown box where the kettle does not work properly - i expect it was designed by someone who is not very practical....i think it is hidious....reception very helpful and courteous but the same cannot be said about the after services elsewhere.... restaurant a real disappointment - plates/cutlery not clean and the presentation of the buffet/lunch/dinner not appetizing nor appealling....watch out for the rowdy music though i think this hotel should be marked out for teenagers and club goers who do not worry about cleaniless or other detail...... 
the park new delhi ,"Functional but unfriendly Excellent location, bang in Connaught place, jantar mantar, close to offices of Govt and financial establishments, good clean area of Delhi. The hotel is hygenic, quick but unfriendly. Guests are tolerated because you pay. 5 star facilities provided as entitlement not with a smile of hospitality. OK for a quick business trip. "

the park new delhi ,"Agi Pub Rocks at this Place! Rooms are clean and comfortable. The location is excellent and you are centrally located but inspite of this hotel being in CP, there is no noise in the rooms. Best part of this place, specially if you are a party animal is the pub cum disc - The Agni. The place is live and kicking till 3 in the morning so for all party lovers and thirsty crows, this is the place.You can get good food till late hours "
the park new delhi ,"Over rated This hotel is very contemporary, but not classy. Things don't look luxurious, but rather a little on the cheap side. Room furnishings looked a little tired and worn.Lobby and bar are not large enough.Poolside is okay - nice for morning yoga before anyone gets up. "
the park new delhi ,The park again very good hotel with beuatiful multi cuisine restaurant 
the park new delhi ,"Its a Ok hotel Visited this hotel on a business visit and was the hotel was ok not that great. Can’t have a business meetings inside hotel very loud eating area, rooms are too small it’s a much compact hotel and can’t get clients here for a business deals. Ambiance is not that great but staff and service is very good. Overall for business don’t select this hotel but at a low price if you have work outside and just want to come back and sleep in this hotel then its ok "
the park new delhi ,"Loved the room Hotel park at Delhi , its loacted at New delhi main city , Very close to cannought place and we had taken a Suit which was the most amazing room I had ever seen . I was in the 10th floor with perfect ambience and perfect climate at delhi. It was a magnificient room and the bathroom was very beautifully made. I have stayed their for 2 nights , Hotel also had beautiful restaurant at the top floor with a beautiful view . they have a pub downstairs , shopping is easy as market is close by . Good Food , Good service and everything was Perfect . "
the park new delhi ,"Excellent Location Very clean hotel in an excellent location. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. Hotels own restaurants are very good aswell. Service was what you would expect from a 5 star deluxe. Staff very pleasant &amp; courteous. There is a lot going on around the hotel as it is centrally located.Be wary of locals approaching you &amp; trying to be friendly, i.e &quot; I don't want anything, I'm just a student &amp; want to practice my english&quot;. They are just trying to con you into going to stores that pay them to get customers in.Airport is no more than 30 minutes away, so hotel is very central. "
the park new delhi ,"Better options Available I Stayed at this property for only one night at their standard room.The check inn was a breeze and absoluetely no issues there.The hotel is in need of some major maintainence which u notice while walking towards the room .As u see walls chipping,paint faiding dirty carpet.e.t.cThe rooms though very modern,and upto date.As they were recently renovated(a couple of years back.) The rooms are very clean though a tad smaller in size.Afamily with even a small child will face problem.The bathrooms again were very clean and were of comfortable size.They have a small pool so those who like their pool workouts beter check.The biggest disappointment is their spa,atrociusly priced and not big enough at all.The gym is ok but they don't have any steam and jacuzzi,plus their sauna was a mouse hole.I tried one of their treatments and i was less then impressed.While checking out i kept on waiting for the bell boy for an hour to take my luggage to the reception for my settelemnt of bills,but despite calling twice he didn.t turn up.So with my small child in my lap i had to take my luggage down on my ownThe hotel entrance is very stylish and chic .But overal if u r looking for luxury and leasure there are much better properties available in very close proximity in same prices.Properties which are big and comfortable. "
the park new delhi ,central place The hotel is located in the central business district of New Delhi and hence is very suitabel for busienss travellers. They have very good club rooms and the decor is exceptional.Food at the fire is really innovative and good. 
the park new delhi ,"Very accessible and luxurious hotel The Park is situated in the heart of Delhi and thats the biggest plus for a business traveller... Its a nice luxurious hotel, nothing much to complain about, a typical nice 5 star hotel with a typically nice Indian hospitality. "
the park new delhi ,"Comfortable and prime location The Hotel location is ideal, being in the CBD and just oppsite my office. The hotel tends to be noisy due to a constant influx of tourists at all times. The coffee shop has a good menu at all times. However, the staff is not very efficient. Best part of the coffee shop is the buffet. You have to plan to avoid peak times to get a seat. rooms are very comfortable and well laid out. Cleanliness and house keeping as well as other services are good. The front desk staff is good. "
the park new delhi ,"Lovely place to recover from Delhi Belly I have been surprised by the other comments because I found this hotel, clean, quiet and extremely comfortable - the best bed in India. As I had the room to myself I was not fazed by the bathroom. The service I experienced was superb - there was always someone on hand to help me and boy did I need it!The pool was lovely but unfortunately a little shady. I also had a wonderful facial. My only negative points are the cost of the internet which was certainly excessive and the cost of a bottle of water which I had thought was complimentary while sending emails. "
the park new delhi ,"Bad first impression The Park attempts to fit itself into the W genre of hotels, albeit failing pretty miserably. I will try to make this really short:1. Night club music audible, at least in my room, until 4 am. Not good considering I had just gotten off a 20 hour flight and had an early call time.2. The lobby and front is infested with mosquitoes. 3. Understandably, even though I have long hair and am male, there is no need to be openly making fun of me for looking like a female [at least to the staff I might have], very unprofessional.4. Rooms are nicely decorated, but removing 23 ornamental pillows from my bed before finally being able to go to sleep is no fun.5. Room had a glass case with relic in it, even though it might seem cool at first, really, it doesn't say so much about the value placed on such important pieces of one's history.6. No wireless.It just wasn't that great, especially for the price. If you read my review of the Trident in Agra you will notice I mention breakfast at 5AM. The staff at the Park were only willing to sell us two day old pastries. So much for the complimentary breakfast.I'm sure there's better hotels to stay at in Delhi. Unless you like to party until 4 am and don't want to deal with trying to find your way home, stay here. All in one. "
the park new delhi ,"Not sure about the bathrooms The hotel is of 4 star standard but trying to be 5 star and not making it. The rooms are a good size but I didn't like the frosted glass walled bathrooms which weren'y very private. The rooms were clean and included TV, DVD, hair dryer, kettle. mini-bar etc. The lifts were rather slow and one of the 3 was out of action. The breakfast was good and there is space to sit outside. There's a pool but I didn't have time to use it. The bar is very expensive - 425 rupees (or £6/$10) for a small bottle of beer! I would consider staying here again but I wouldn't drink at the bar! "
the park new delhi ,"Very nice Hotel. Clean Hotel Room fine Bathroom...large bath would take a week to fill...Shower a little awkward to work.. but of no great consequence. Pool is outside we didnt use it as it was still quite cool for outdoor bathing. The Hotel is located at the end of an Avenue oposite a Conservatory (Small park) it is 2-3 minutes away from a busy shopping area. We only went down this street once found it a little overpowering and crowded also everyone wanted to either sell us something or &quot;Be our Guide&quot; (for a fee of course)The Restaurant in the Reception was quite casual and served all kinds of food. The buffet looked very nice indeed, we didnt sample it because it was our first visit to India and we were over cautious at first with regards to food. The Breakfast was very nice- self service. The food we were served in the Restauirant was hot and well cooked. The staff in the Restaurant and Reception were friendly and helpfull. "
the park new delhi ,"Noisy! I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to the service I receive at a hotel, but had to share this terrible experience from my recent stay at The Park.My husband and I needed to be up by 7 am the morning after we checked into the hotel, so we called it an early night and headed to our room at 11 pm. We could hear music/beats inside the room, so I called the front desk and inquired about the noise. They said it was coming from their club, and wouldn't reach above the 3rd floor. They asked us if we'd like to move to a room on a higher floor. We thought was nice, and agreed to change rooms. When we got to our room on the higher floor, we found we were facing the pool area, where a party was going on. Now, not only could we hear beats, but the actual words to the techno songs...clearly. No pillow over my head would make them go away. So I called the front desk again, and again, and again. In all, I probably called half a dozen times. The front desk would say the party would be ending soon, the party would end at 1, the party was just ending, the party would end at 2, etc. I was always polite when I spoke with them, letting them know I didn't think it was their fault, and asking them if they could &quot;please just turn it down&quot;, or &quot;did [they] maybe have ear plugs I could try?&quot;. All I got was that there was nothing else they could do, and that the party would end in some time. By the last couple calls, the front desk staff sounded annoyed at having to speak with me, and I was on the verge of loosing my &quot;nice.&quot; So, my husband called the front desk at 2:30 in the morning, and asked them again to please do SOMETHING about the noise. They said a manager was taking care of it. At 2:45 the music FINALLY stopped. My husband and I got less than four hours sleep.No one asked how our stay was when we checked out. I remember because I was ready to let them know how disappointed I was. I did leave a comment card, though.Even by Indian standards, the hotel was not very clean. There were MANY stains on furniture/rugs, and the rooms were dusty. It felt more like a hostel than a hotel.The door to the bathroom is about 2 feet from the bed. It's a frosted, glass, sliding door that leaves a 2 inch gap between it and the bathroom wall, so there is not complete privacy. The lighting was also a bit difficult to figure out. I've never written an online complaint about a hotel stay before, but felt compelled to do so after this experience. I would never stay at The Park again. "
the park new delhi ,"Never go on a Friday! We spent 2 separate nights at this hotel at the start and finish of our 3 week tour in India. The first night wasn't too problematic although the hotels 'trendy' bathroom was totally impractical - a washbasin that was too high to use comfortably, hardly anywhere to put stuff and opaque glass walls and sliding door which ensured no privacy at all! The last night, however, was something else! I don't know if Friday is the only disco night but be warned even if you are on the 4rth floor, as we were, you will not sleep at all. Not only was the music at full blast but there were also people talking and smoking in the corridor outside our room for most of the night. At 3.30 a.m. I complained to the duty manager who was kindness itself and did tell the people to shut up! The disco ended at 4 a.m. so we got a couple of hours sleep then. "
the park new delhi ,"Barely okay rooms and lobby We spent 4 nights here upon arrival in New Delhi as travel service had chosen hotel for us. We had no problems with check-in or check out, fast and accurrate but a representative of the travel company got us registered and we were upgraded to the club floor. The area rug in the room needed to be cleaned, the whole place felt slightly dirty. But bed and towels were clean. The club floor offered nothing different, internet access was chargeable and so was coffee. We ate breakfast here and it was fine for a buffet which catered to all different nationalities. But service was slow and got fast only after we paid the bill as the waiters were looking for a tip (even if they were not our waiter they raced over to collect it). The maid service was very uneven, vrying from outstanding to poor - no replacement of bath towels without asking, no additional coffee. The decor is an attempt to be contemporary and &quot;hip&quot; but ends up garish and tacky. Lots of small tour groups stay here (especially French). Outside of the hotel gates there are so many hawkers that the first time we had to return as they would not even allow us to walk (they blocked our path). The location of being central made no difference to us as we were picked up at the hotel and driven to the 'sights&quot;. "
the park new delhi ,"Comfortable but not wow Obviously taking its inspiration from the W hotels right down to leaving apples and oranges in the room. It's not luxury but it's a good base to explore Delhi from. The rooms are comfortable and generally clean but not spectacular. If you're a sensitive sleeper, the noise from the nightclub may keep you awake. "
the park new delhi ,"Stylish but expensive if work is not paying. The Park was an unusual choice by our tour group which doesn't really want or expect posh hotels like this but it was a good start and end to the trip. The hotel is clearly upmarket, well designed and stylish in the entrance hall and bedrooms. The staff are very friendly and service was always with a smile although felt a little slow on reception.I can't say whether its good value but the hotel is certainly popular with the local wealthy kids and they seem to have a nightclub on Saturday nights so be warned not to get a room too close to the ground floor as it disturbed a number of people in our group. Given that a coffee cost us £3.50 when we arrived everything was very expensive compared to the rest of India generally and Rs400 for an hour of internet connection shows this is more a business hotel. Water and food is better found outside the hotel unless you have deep pockets or work is picking up the bill. "
the park new delhi ,"Noisy Hotel Expensive Restaurant This hotel is in close proximity of Connaught Place where my husband had dung thrown on his shoes in an attempt to mug himThe hotel is clean, but there are stains on the carpet and a noisy disco. Although the restaurant has a good choice the prices are expensive "
the park new delhi ,"dirty and overpriced; yes a friendly staff but not very professional Two of us stayed here (two rooms, on business) in early February 2009 for six night. During the course of our stay, we also went to three other hotels in New Delhi for meetings. All three were better-- much,much better-than The Park, so much so that we asked for room rates while at each and found that these others (Imperial, Taj, and one other I'm forgetting--Claridges?) were in the same price range. I've never bothered writing a review before but this place cost so much, and the rooms were so filthy and rundown, that I had to warn others. I'm not sure if the other reviews here are from real people or from the hotel; they're just too positive. The staff was all pleasant and the area by the pool isn't unattractive,but the loud,obnoxious and constant music there made even a normal conversation almost impossible. I was certain the sockets in my room would explode, so I unplugged my laptop and other electrical devices everyday. The wait staff was in the hotel restaurant was friendly but there are so many working that they get in each other's way,sitting multiple parties at one table (without knowing they've done so). We will not return. "
the park new delhi ,"Nice rooms but noisy We stayed at the Park for 2 nights. We arrived late on the Friday night and a hotel car picked us up from Indri Gandhi airport - a good call as it's a bit much when you step off the plane!! The hotel itself is nice and central. Security in high force. Room decent size and modern - although not especially clean (particularly the bathroom). The rooms are not sound proofed and the road outside is very busy - lots of beeping (as with everywhere in India!) and shouting - perhaps this was as it was Friday and Saturday night. There was also a lot of pigeons and no nails or anything on the outside window sill to stop loads of them landing and cooing constantly. The bar area is obviously party central for rich Indians - and probably fun if you can join in. But, we had a 5am start so we ate in Fire (very tasty - lovely pepper chocolate truffles with the bill) and headed to bed. When we checked out at 5am (after disturbances in the hallway throughout the night - despite being on the 7th floor) - the bar was just kicking out. Whilst it was nothing compared to London bars - it was still off putting for an expensive hotel and there was a number of drunk men hanging around - even the receptionist seemed embarrassed. On the plus side - the travel centre sorted out some changes in our itinerary and booked some train travel for us - they were very helpful. "
the park new delhi ,"Enjoyed the Park very comfortable Our agent moved us here at the last minute so I did not have a chance to check it out on Trip Adviser ahead of time. I was very pleased. Security at the front door was in full force. The staff was ultra courteous, the room was small but spotless and the bed comfortable. Nice art on the walls and some sculpture, too. Fresh fruit was waiting for us. Service requests were fulfilled promptly. The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast buffet with many made-to-order items. There was variety from standard Indian fare to Chinese and western-style selections. This was our first trip to Delhi so I was a little anxious about the neighborhood but soon learned it was pretty normal for Delhi. We spotted several monkeys frolicking on the roof of a building behind the hotel that looked like a school. After walking around for a while and being bombarded with the Delhi stimuli, it was a relief to return to the peaceful hotel. The exercise room was well-equipped. It was too cold to use the pool but they were cleaning it anyway. Definitely would stay there again. "
the park new delhi ,"Wonderful birthday weekend From the moment we stopped our vehicle, we were escourted to the front desk and immediately received attention. Due to it being our birthday weekend, we were upgraded and treated like a king and queen. The rooms were tastefully decorated. The bath tub, which an entire family could fit in, was the highlight. We enjoyed that thoroughly. The room was warm and comfortable and the bathrooms were tidy and clean. The room service was excellent and food was divine. Our birthday morning, was so special. All the staff wished us. At breakfast we were well taken care off, the waiters, always on the go. Even though it was our birthdays, my husband and I noticed that this is the overall treatment of all guests, which was excellent to behold. Nowhere did we see, such enthusiasm in being so helpful. We admired that about the staff at the hotel. We certainly left with wonderful memories and an unforgetable birthday. "
the park new delhi ,"Not worth the money! Exterior is ugly but in good location. Interior is retro and rather nice, but in need of updating, due to wear and tear.We booked a 'luxury' room and paid a luxury price for it, however, the room was very small and although attractive, there was absolutely nothing luxury about it! The bathroom was also very small and the moldy grouting, dirty toiletries, lack of towels (and not at all fresh smelling) made me very resentful of the price I had paid.The worst part of our stay was the LOUD, THUMPING music that was playing until 6am on both of the nights we stayed at the hotel. Our travel agents omitted to inform us that the hotel has a very renowned bar/club that attracts all the young generation in Delhi. In fact it is so popular that the music does not end until 6am!!!!!! My husband called reception at 6.30am to ask what all the noise was about and he was told that they did not know what he referring to. As we were checking out at 4am the next day we saw for ourselves exactly what had caused the vibrations that had been coming through our pillows!! I was fuming!! As a small boutique hotel they are certainly not equipped to be hosting late night parties and then denying knowing any reason of where noise is coming from when grouchy guests call reception when they are woken up!The service generally was rubbish and we didn't even get a 'goodbye' from the receptionist when we were checking out. The only good thing about the hotel is the location, decent food and moderate decor. Other than that it is overpriced, rooms are too small, staff are rude and the loud music is really off putting when trying to get to sleep! I would NOT stay there again! "
the park new delhi ,"Slick property great location This hotel was under renovation then but parts of it were operational. Conran and partners have done a fabulous job in terms of revamping this property. As you enter you are greeted by blue and pink interiors which they all boutique.On the lobby level there is the MIST coffee shop which served wood fired pizzas. Also they have India restaurant called Fire which serves great food.Room we got was on 4th floor. Size of the room was small but it was comfortable. Decor was good but housekeeping was not upto the mark. If you are two people then the glass bathroom is not very nice.Overall, location is great and service above average. Not outstanding but decent enough experience. "
the park new delhi ,"Bad services rude staff This is another expensive hotel in Delhi....The hotel itself is nice, good, well decorated rooms. But the service and staff is terrible. Got a wake up call at 4am that was not required (later I discover it was by mistake!). Despite telling the operator that I didn't require that wake up call, I got a reminder wake up call at 4:30 (unbelievable). Complained again and, to complete the mess, got someone coming to my room at 5:30 to offer a T-Shirt (from an ongoing convention). My original plan was to wake-up at 7:30 and leave for a working day! While checking-out, did complain to the staff, who was incredibly rude, asking me to wait for the manager...The manager came and, with that face and eyes looking for nowhere said &quot;I'm sorry&quot; and that was it. Maybe that was a very unlucky day for me but I'll never take a chance in this hotel again. "
the park new delhi ,"Poor Management --- money stolen from room by staff The most significant point in this review is that we feel we were robbed by the hotel staff --- literally robbed. When we went to breakfast the last morning we left things in our room, out of the safe (shame on us - we ALWAYS use the safe) because we were only going to be gone 45 minutes and we were re-charging our DVD and iPod. Luckily for us the person who cleaned our room only got into the purse and stole $170. When we left our room with the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on the door (from the previous evening - no one had knocked all night or morning) and the T.V. on so staff (or anyone else) would not come in or knock. Unfortunately our room was very close to the elevator and the person who cleans our room was right there as we left (the only person on that floor who saw us). He asked us if we had laundry to pick up. When we said no he asked when we were checking out. We told him we were checking out that afternoon. Upon coming back from b-fast we noticed that money was missing. I notified the front desk about our missing money and asked if their system could track entries into our room. When we came back to the hotel early afternoon they notified us that the room was entered once and it was by the person who cleans our room. He said he was checking for laundry (?) because our clean room sign was on the door (it was not). He then changed his story (they said it was a language thing) and said he was in there to clean the room ---- but NOTHING had been done. If something had been done it would then have been obvious to us that HE had been in our room. The management assured us that they would investigate and take care of this. Not a single thing was done and never --- not once --- did they even call our room or leave a message as to what was transpiring. I believe this is not an isolated incident and it supports some of the other complaints in T.A. about management here.We were here on a tour with Gate One. Pros: Food was good., location not bad, rooms were clean and modern.Cons: Obviously our stolen money and management's poor/non-existent follow-up, the elevators are VERY slow (one being out of service), the pool was unusable due to construction, "
the park new delhi ,"Interesting and different Apart from the excessive wait to have our luggage delivered to our room - Tip - wrestle the porter and take it yourself - I can recommend.Centrally located and a short walk from Central Cottage Industries ( a must).Gin and Tonic in the bar is good, but at a price that would make you faint...Rooms very modern and lovely bathroom, although the glass enclosure would be rather offputting if you were suffering from Delhi Belly and wanted a bit of privacy from your room mate.Breakfast is not to be missed with a Dosa and Omlette chef and smoked salmon. "
the park new delhi ,"Good Location but poor Decor We have just returned after staying at this hotel for 9 nights . We found the location to be excellent and staffs were helpful. Breakfast was also good.Beside the above there is nothing good to say about the hotel. Rooms are too small and there is no space for your suitcases. When we checked in, our rooms were not particularly clean and I don't think the sheets had been changed. The Towels had stains and the bath Robes looked dirty as well. We immediately complained and they changed our bed linen and towels. We also complained about the size of the room and if we can be moved to another rooms as we had 2 rooms with long stay. Our request was not honoured and we were advised that only rooms available are in their Residence category with high rates. It is a run down hotel with dirty carpets in the corridor. Food in the Restaurant is too expensive. One day we just had 3 portions of toasted sandwiches and 1 portion of French Fries which costed us around £35.00. Our room keys never worked and we had to swipe the card 10 - 15 times . We asked the the reception to reprogramme it and it still did not work. Housekeeping needs to improve as most days they forgot to replace towels.At the Mist restaurant it appeared that residence guest do not have priority as we were refused a table in the non smoking area as they were all booked . Staff at the front desk were aware of our dissatisfaction but nothing was done.In my view this is 4 star hotel and no where close to 5 star in terms of hotel décor, room size and cleanliness . In the past I have stayed at Grand Intercontinental which a true 5 star Hotel. I would not return back to this hotel in future and will not recommend to any friends "
the park new delhi ,"OLD and RUN DOWN. NEED A FULL MAKEOVER IMMEDIATELY! This hotel is very run down. Everthing is old and run down.The lights and stuff is also old and run down and don't always workThe key has to be swiped several times in order to work.Food is too expensive and in fact for the condition that hotel is in, the hotel price is far to expensive and should not be regarded as a five star hotel. Staff is helpful and friendly but slow.Rather stay at the Le Meridien for the same price and get a better new mordern hotel. "
the park new delhi ,"Where are we We stayed here on two accasions between tour on our India Holiday. I must say that from the outset l felt as if we were back in the 70's in Australia.It is indeed different, and somwehat corny. The hotel is fitted out as the 70's, which is OK but indeed different.The drinks and food were excellent, in fact at breakfast whilse we ate European the staff presented us with a dish of varied indian foods and explained it all to us. Greatly appreciated.On our second time to the hotel, we were treated like royalty. Tips do work. We were upgraded, andcould not have asked for better service.Location is good, just watch for the Monkeys.Next time l would prefer a more Indian Hotel, l think. "
the park new delhi ,"Bad Management The amenities in the hotel some how above the average of most of the other hotels in Delhi. However it shows that its getting old and need a complete makeover.But the reason why I wouldn't stay in that hotel again is the Staff,Staff is very very uneducated (including the managers). Give them any chance they will try to fool you and try to make the life somewhat easier for themselves.And the most horrible thing is they don't have any limits when they are asking for the bill. Doesn't matter if you are resting by the pool or exercising at the gym, somebody will come and question you about what you are doing there... "
the park new delhi ,"Convenient We stayed at the Hotel in April - my husband was on business and I was on holiday. The Hotel is tired and needs a refit, we were both a bit disappointed when we arrived as it is classed as a five star Hotel and clearly it isn't.. Our room wasn't particularly clean and I don't think the sheets had been changed. The view from our room was just an awful derelict site. Our room keys never worked and I had to go back down to reception several times a day to get them reprogrammed. The food was good in the restaurant and the bar service attentive, but expensive!! The pool area was okay, but there was a real problem with flies, which made it unpleasant to sit out and the pool bar had a problem with cooling so all the drinks were warm. I had a spa treatment, which was excellent. The staff were very friendly, but desperate for tips, so make sure to take a good supply of lower denomination notes. "
the park new delhi ,"Liked The Park This is a nice hotel. It is in a very good location for walking into Connaught Circus, walking to the Bangla Sahib Temple and is directly opposite the Janta Mantar observatory. The food was good and the rooms clean and quite civilised. "
the park new delhi ,"Bad value for money I stayed at the Park for business purposes. It is a modern hotel (futuristic meets retro) with beautiful rooms -- lots of glass and marble and nice amenities. However the fundamentals of this hotel are extremely week. There is a 24 hour dance bar on the main floor however no matter what floor you are on you hear the pounding beat -- I was on the 4th floor, a colleague was on the 7th floor, and we both heard it. It woke me up around 3 am and you can also hear people from outside. If you want to sleep this is not a good bet. Another poor feature is the lack of expertise of the hotel staff. The front desk is staffed by very young, beautiful locals but they are horribly inexperienced, verging on inept. For example, I was having problems with my room key and went down to complain I could not get into my room. The front desk staff gave me another electronic key, I went back up to find the same problem. I went down again and they asked me if I had the right room. I had to argue with them -- it was quite ridiculous especially at 10pm when you just want to get to your room and get ready for bed.The restaurant is quite nice and it is near some shopping areas so the location is good, but overall I felt this was very poor value for money (I think the room was around 350 USD per night). I would not recommend it. "
the park new delhi ,"Dirty poor service but pretty central This hotel is according to many locals The posh and most Fashionable hotel of New Delhi so we decided to give it a try. We booked via their website and asked for a non smoking room, we got given a smoking room. We managed after an hour of negotiation to get the room we asked for in the first place (the receptionist said she was doing us a favor!).The room was tiny but manageable for a couple. The biggest turn off was how dusty and generally disgusting the room was. Not to mention the sheets that had blood stains on them! The frosted glass separating the bathroom from the main bedroom was covered with unidentified traces…. The hotel is in general bad condition .The restaurant’s white walls are covered with food stains.. .Needless to say we only stayed one night and quickly checked out. I would have believed in Murphy’s Law if we have not met at breakfast another couple that was as disappointed as we were.To add on to our list of negative experience, our bill was not correct and we had to argue it out with the receptionist…and we were not the only ones doing so… it seemed that most of the clients checking out as we did, had something to complain about to the manager…My husband and I have been many times in India and we have gotten a pretty good idea of what to expect for which price range but this is by far the biggest disappointment. For the same price you might as well stay at the Claridge even if it is a bit out of town it is worth the 10min longer cab ride to the city center. "
the park new delhi ,"A 3-star trying to pass for a 5-star I should have known better to stay at the international hotels but my travel agent told me that this is one of India's finest. It is not. The hotel lobby has a stench that is not pleasing and there were quite a few (about 10) Indian men just sitting in the couches in the lobby which gave me the creeps. I did not try the food, instead I dined at the Shangri La which was superb, but I can say that the spa at The Park is great. The price was pretty good but the therapists were superb.The room was okay, it was modern, very boutiquey style, a little small. Besides the room and the spa/gym, I would not have stayed here esp. since their prices are comparable to either the Le Meridian, Shangrila or Hotel Nikko. "
the park new delhi ,"A relaxing end to a hectic fortnight... We stayed here for our last night in India, having travelled on the overnight train from Kathgodam. We arrived at the hotel at 6.30 a.m., and within fifteen minutes they had a room ready for us at no extra charge.The staff were friendly, and the rooms were clean.Yes, it wasn't cheap, but it was a relaxing last day in India. We found the taxis a few yards away from the hotel better value than the ones that were at the door, and we used these for our final journey to the airport. "
the park new delhi ,"Tacky and sub-standard - Not good enough to be a 5* IT WAS TERRIBLE! I was at the hotel in April '07 for one night. Me and my mom we're actually staying at the Imperial for 6 nights, however on the 3rd day Im[perial was overbooked and so they transfered us to the Park for one night.At the proch of the hotel you have staff dressed in shabby uniforms (v-neck velvet type tops and trousers), once inside the unorganised front desk took ages to have a room for us and made us wait around even though we had a reservation. The lobby is small - is decorated to give a modern and contemparary feel but fails and ends up looking cheap!To the rooms - its COMPACT - i'd call it a capsule room. The bathroom was tiny reminded me of the little toilets you have in an airplane. The bathroom was actually a part of the room - frosted glass walls was only what separeted the two and there was no lock on the bathroom sliding door. IMPO - At one point someone was knocking on our door - we were a few seconds late in answering and this staff member thought he could just use his card to get access to our room. We complained about this - wanted to know who this staff member was and why was trying to get into our room - nothing helpful could be said by the manager. Being two women in the room, I found this very disturbing knowing that anyone could just try barging through the room. We did not feel safe at night.Few PROS: DVD player in the room, with free DVDs to watch available from the library in the hotel. Breakfast was good, even though we were hassled by a staff member on where to sit in the breakfast hall. In the end I was relieved to be out of their and back into the Imperial which felt like a different world!!And the fact that the Park cost Rs 12,000 and is rubbish compared to Rs 13,000 at the imperial its really worth spending that little bit extra. "
the park new delhi ,"Park Hotel in Delhi close to the airport We had an extra night in Delhi and were given the Park. It is a very nice, clean hotel. However, it did not have that much character and was overall a little cold atmosphere. The bathroom is huge, nice to have the TV in there. Too pricey for what you get, however, "
the park new delhi ,"Nice Hotel Expensive I liked this Hotel. The hotel is themed is earth, wind, fire, water and sky. This is done in a sophisticated way and makes a change from standard hotel chains. All the staff I met were very helpful and were eager to make sure my stay was good.My room was lvery clean, arge and spacious with a huge bath and a big LCD TV, DVD player, internet connection and IPOD dock. The best feature of my room had to be the wheat grass growing in trough across the width of my room.The food was also very good and I really like the bar.The only downside of this hotel is the price! Watch out for the luxury tax on top of the rate. I paid 16,000 INR a night with taxes on top. "
the park new delhi ,"Really comfortable stay I feel many of the reviews here are unfairly harsh on this hotel. Whether that's down to inflated expectations of Delhi I don't know but we found this hotel to be clean, very comfortable and offered good service. OK, so it's not St. Martin's Lane hotel in London but you can't expect that because they don't charge the same kind of prices. All in all about the only mid-range place that we could manage to get availability in and I'm happy that we landed upon it.It's conveniently located for Connaught Place with a cab and auto rickshaw rank right outside the entrance, which is superb for visiting Old Delhi, the rest of the city and of course onward travel.Great points to note - we got upgraded to the top floor rooms, which have a private bar and dining area, with excellent happy hour from 6.30-8.30 at time of writing. The pool area was great and the fitness room and spa well equipped with the latest machines. Breakfast also included in that top floor area, which was a real bonus.Points to watch out for - we always check the bill like a pair of hawks wherever we go and noticed they had squeezed a couple of minibar items that we didn't have. Despite upgrading us, they had added more to the normal 'luxury tax' that you have to pay. Our point was that in effect we hadn't chosen to be upgraded so thought it was unfair that they should make us pay for that bit of the tax. They removed everything we questioned with little fuss. Secondly, on our experience and that of other guests we spoke to, there is minimal chance that you will get to check in before noon if you arrive on an early morning flight so either book yourself a rest room at the airport and arrive later or be happy to leave your cases with the porter and do some exploring until your room is ready. The hotel was happy to check us in and charge us a reduced rate for the previous evening but considering that we had only six hours to wait, we passed on the offer.Finally, although they looked good, we passed on the restaurants in the hotel and ate dinner at the Banana Leaf - basic but excellent veg South Indian restaurant in Connaught Place and stuffed our faces for under 500 rupees! "
the park new delhi ,"A Crazy Place with Some Hope The hotel is not worth the money. The staff was very good and very helpful and my room on the 10th floor was pretty awesome. Marble floors (no mats) in the bathroom with a large marble bathtub and flat screen TV. Pretty nice. But that was contrasted by dirty carpet in the hallways, a dingy front entry and dirty elevators. To use the pool you have to walk through the main restaurant... which is awkward when you are wearing swim shorts and no shoes.The spa and work out room are very good. So the rooms on the 10th floor and the spa are great but the value and cleanliness of the hotel are pretty lacking. Only stay here if there is nothing else available... which is what I did. "
the park new delhi ,"Overpriced but likeable Hotels in this category are, I'm told, geared toward the business traveler; hence the price tag. The price to value ratio has little meaning for the nonbusiness traveler. All hotels in this category are severely overpriced, and you'll have to look long and hard for a less expensive place that does not have some kind of unhappy or scary story attached. We stayed with a small tour group, so I don't know what we paid, but I'm sure it was a significant price break.That said, we liked the Park. We stayed three nights. At check in we asked for an upper floor room, got one on the 6th, and it was just fine. Yes, its a bit shabby and worn around the edges. The hallway floor creaked and bounced, and carpets were, well, amusing. The staff was friendly, eager, and helpful. I had no problems at the front desk as mentioned in other postings. It's supposed to be a &quot;designer&quot; hotel, and I guess it is. Pink, burgundy, and baby blue, hanging beads, cloud photo mural in the elevators. It's no &quot;W&quot;, but so what; a sense of humor is helpful.The location is ok, within walking distance to Connaught Circle, reputed to be a major commercial district. Well, I guess so, and it is the major/luxury hotel district, but keep in mind you're in New Delhi, not London or Paris, New York or LA. It's very noisy and crowded. Like everything in Dehli, it's shabby and worn-out. Anyway Delhi is very spread out, lots of different neighborhoods, so convenient placement has less meaning.The restaurant was pretty good. We had a few light meals, and they were tasty. We did not try the more expensive, fancier restaurant to the right of the front desk. Service was a bit slow, but not unusually so for India. The breakfast buffet was pretty darn good. Very extensive. Even more than passable dim-sum (with commercial sauces). Some of the western entries (cold cuts and cheese) were pretty strange. And what's with the baked beans anyway (all over India at breakfast). Eggs are very good and tasty. Try the little white rice flour cakes that you sprinkle with ghee and spice mix...yumbo. Bacon is fatty but good, and chicken breakfast sausage is a place you may not want to go (I did and lived).All in all, I'd stay there again if I could afford it. But, next time I'll search out smaller hotels and b and b's, an up-and-coming category. "
the park new delhi ,"Acceptable quality very expensive The Park was the official hotel for a conference I attended. For some reason I expected to get great value for money in India, and indeed outside the hotels you do. But the Park is very over priced and I would not pay their rack rate if returning to Delhi.A friendly and polite driver met me from my flight and weaved through the amazing traffic system to the Park (took about 45 minutes)Check in was polite but very slowRoom was OK but not special given the price. The rooms pictured on the Internet seem better than the one I was allocated.The electronic door lock was annoyingly temperamental.Generally staff were very helpful.The food was the best feature of this hotel.The bar was pricey by local standards.At checkout an Indian guy pushed in front of me but despite my protests the receptionist served him first.Although I was happy to tip during my visit, the staff at the Park were certainly active in demanding their gratuities, given the high cost of staying there I found that unacceptable. "
the park new delhi ,"Not what you would expect The Park hotel is situated pretty far from city center, at least if that’s what you call it in New Delhi. Part of the rooms has a nice garden view, visitors of the other part can enjoy nothing but construction works all over around. I’ve been to Delhi on a business trip with some important colleagues and had to choose a good place to stay in. Considering my experience I can say that The Park is definitely not a 5 stars hotel. On one hand it is supposed to be stylish, has all sort of bathroom compliments usual for the level requested, bathrobe and slippers (which I myself was afraid to put on), pretty big room and night service. On the other hand, what you’ll have in reality is dirty towels, shabby furniture, muddy carpet and very old bathtub. Since I had one evening left from business diners, I tried the local restaurant, which turned out to be a buffet. It was eatable, but not tasty. While leaving, one of my colleagues paid for the minibar. For the first time in my life I became a witness of staff checking your minibar in case you lied while leaving. The reception guy told me that one member of our group didn’t pay for cola or something, I paid it myself. Later on it turned out to be that everything had already been paid, my colleague even showed me the bill with that cola mentioned. Be careful while checking out!All and all, this was a 3+ hotel. As I understood, it’s a common situation in New Delhi. There exist luxurious hotels, like Tadj Mahal hotel, for example. But the average price would be at about 600-700 dollars per night. You can use the Park hotel for the short business stay in Delhi, although you would definitely be disappointed considering 500 dollar per night you’d paid. "
the park new delhi ,"Marginal Not worth the Money This hotel was obviously very hip and clubby. Lots of youngparty people in the restaurant and in the club. It seemed tobe a popular spot for European tourists as well. The room wasclean and the accomodations were ok. I expected more for the ridiculous prices they charge. Due to a family illness wecould only stay one night although we had booked for 2. Whenwe arrived there was a man having a problem with settling something and he was talking to the manager. I thought he washaving a problem but later realized of the 4 times I was in the lobby, each time a guest had a problem with the hotel staff. I found the service in the restaurant ok by Indian standards, the food was good. Breakfast was the best part of the stay. Themost gracious employees were the bell hops. We had difficulty settling our bill early while checking out. It took a very long time(about 1 hour) to finally decide we were not going to get anywhere with this hotel staff (manager finally) and so we gave up. If you have to, this hotel is in a good location. Just expect to pay way too much, not get any value for your money and possibly have trouble getting a refund if you plans have to change. "
the park new delhi ,"Think before you stay here We stayed here for 3 nights.The customer service was appalling until we complained bitterly to the duty manager.We arrived at 10pm the first night, had to wait until 12.30am to access our room and the sheets were dirty and also the carpet.We ended up staying on the 2nd floor. Dont do it. It is right above the nightclub. You will not sleep at all until after 3am. We complained 3 times from midnight and they kept saying oh it wont last long and it does not happen often. At 2pm they offered us another room, we had to be up for a tour in 4 hours!We were moved up floors 2 days later and we thought we might as well join them in the nightclub and guess what!? We left at 3am, make sure you stay very high in this hotel.The breakfast and Fire restaurant were the good elements of this hotel. "
the park new delhi ,Wierd and not designer Its not the same to design your hotel in an inane way and put objects which have no relevance to hospitality in your environment and claim to be a &quot;designer&quot; hotel...hello its not funky just wierd!!! 
the park new delhi ,"Great location but a bit shabby around the edges We loved the location of this hotel - really enjoyed exploring crowded Connaught Place (make a trip to Fab India), had a fun dinner at DV8 watching cricket with the locals - and it's close to most sites, but it's a bit shabby. The public spaces were a little dirty and the room had a hint of grubbiness to it. The linens have seen better days. I do want to mention that the housekeeping staff was very friendly and always asked if we needed anything when we greeted them in the halls. The rates at this hotel were similar to others in its category, so if you are considering a larger hotel like The Park I would recommend you choose another in this area. "
the park new delhi ,"Rooms Vary I stayed at the Park two nights as part of a tour. The rooms vary; my room on the fifth floor was quite nice but those in our group with rooms on the third floor went sleepless because of the noise and reverberation from the disco. The included buffet breakfasts were acceptable. If you dare to leave the hotel you will be surrounded by taxi drivers, rickshaw drivers, kids, vendors, etc. This is the worst city I have ever visited. (I didn't go to Kolkata). Delhi is a 24 hour traffic jam "
the park new delhi ,"The Park is a disappointment I stayed there for four nights and was almost continuously disappointed by this hotel. Service turned out to be highly inconsistent. Housekeeping was poor: no complimentary bottled water was provided after my arrival, and I had to chase down the staff every day to get the complimentary bottles promised by the hotel. One day, three of the four towels in the room disappeared and were not replaced until I went after the staff. Toilet paper wasn’t replaced either. The mini-bar was never re-stocked throughout my stay. The air-conditioning unit was unable to produce anything other than cold air, regardless of which settings were selected, a nuisance during chilly winter nights. It was also impossible to raise the blinds to let in some sunlight. The bath-room did look snazzy but had its own problems: there was no discernible means of ventilation, and the flimsiness of the shower curtain made it impossible to use the shower without flooding the entire room. The public areas were fairly cramped, especially the lobby. The breakfast buffet was adequate but unexciting; one morning the staff would not turn on the lights in a large part of the breakfast area for more than half an hour, leaving guests to eat in the dark. Admittedly, the unreliability of the staff had its benefits: on one occasion the waiter refused to let me sign for a coffee and piece of cake which as a result did not show up on my final bill. Even so, I would have gladly traded this freebie for greater consistency of service overall. The attached restaurant “Fire” is quite pleasant and the food is good, but the incessant self-glorification of the staff and their obsession with questionnaires are enough to spoil anyone’s dining experience. The airport pick-up was a major rip-off: the hotel charges the equivalent of USD 40 for a pick-up from Gandhi International, a multiple of what even the most ruthless taxi driver would dare to ask for. (It deserves notice that a genuinely classy classy place like The Imperial a block away offers free transfers from and to the airport.) All in all, I got the impression that The Park is keen to create a superficial impression of classiness that is not backed up by an effort to provide consistent service and marred by brazen rip-offs. It is hard to think of a reason to choose this place over others. If you are willing to spend several hundred dollars a night, it makes much more sense to pay a little extra and stay at a genuinely five-star hotel such as the the Oberoi or the Imperial. Otherwise, save some money by choosing a decent place without the feeble five-star pretensions of The Park. I would not stay there again. "
the park new delhi ,"One of the best hotel experiences I ever had I stayed in a deluxe room for 3 nights. The hotel staff has been the friendliest I have ever seen in any hotel I stayed. The Breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner buffet are absolutely amazing. It is a very chique hotel with good looking, young employees, a stunning bar that is packed with young people during the weekend and a very nice pool (not too big though)I can only recommend this place and if you wanna go party in Delhi this is a perfect place to stay "
the park new delhi ,"Dissapointing The hotel was booked some time before our arrival at 2.30 after a long flight from London. The staff appeared to be more concerned with paperwork rather than helping us to our room.The hotel though was clean and had all the amenities you would expect from a designer hotel. You also got the feeling that Delhi's fashionistas visited this place for drinks and so on.Sadly, on our second night we discovered that the hotel has a night club on the ground floor, which would be fine had we not been jet-lagged. After long and heated discussions with reception we were moved from the second to the eighth floor, only to be woken up by an &quot;after party&quot; next door.It transpired that the hotel had no staff to deal with this and did not care enough to send people to sort out the matter.We left feeling quite disappointed and know that if we were to visit Delhi again we would not stay at The Park. "
the park new delhi ,"Good location but definitely overpriced I stayed in The Park in Dehli for 4 nights in October 2007 on a holiday tour through India. The hotel is located near Connaught Place, which is great. However, the hotel is seriously overpriced and the service is just average for Indian standards. (i.e we booked a pick up from the airport and I received two confirmation e-mails. Of course there was no driver expecting us and neither was an apology offered at the hotel. The rooms are rather small and the bathrooms are meant to be &quot;designed&quot; unfortunately - the designer forgot a bit about functionality ......so they are rather wet rooms made of glass!. Food is also rather mainstream and the breakfast is terrible with very limited variety, unless you fancy a curry in the morning.Because the hotel is very central in Dehli, it is quite noisy too and the hotel certainly contributes with some loud music around the pool at night, too. "
the park new delhi ,Much better than expected I had read some negative reviews of this hotel but my wife and I - and our two friends - were most impressed - and particularly by the excellent attitude of ALL the staff we met. Smiles and helpful suggestions were standard. We arrived at 1 a.m. but were checked into high quality rooms quickly and efficiently. The breakast room is very large and bright and one can also eat outside in the large garden. The range of breakfast foods is good and eggs/omelettes are cooked to order. The pool is great and the bar round the pool stays open till well into the evening. Drink prices are quite high - but this is the case in all the hotels in Delhi. The only negative in The Park is the noise from the disco if your room is near it. (The hotel is rated &quot;the most happening place in town&quot; we were told). Our room was immediately above the disco and I (but not my wife) found ear-plugs necessary on one of the four nights we stayed. I made a casual comment about the noise to one of the staff the next day and we were surprised that we were immediately offered a room change - but it wasn't worth the bother of re-packing! 
the park new delhi ,"Carry Your Own Bags If you are looking for the following from a hotel then the Park in Delhi is for you:1) Noise all night, including weekdays2) Lifts not working3) RECEPTION who say they have called porters to pick up your bags, BUT DO NOT COME, so advise is build up your muscles before booking 4) RECEPTION constantly baggering yopu to enquire when you will leave, when the know you are there for one sleepless night anyway5) Poor breakfastSo if this what you desire in a hotel then the Park in Delhi is the one for you. "
the park new delhi ,"Badly Managed ""Design Hotel"" My business partner &amp; I were in Delhi on a 3 day business trip and wanted somewhere that was central &amp; offered us all the details and luxury of a &quot;Design Hotel&quot;. Doing business in Delhi is tough ,with long days that can sometimes be rewarding but other days which just seem so frustrating that you want to jump on the next plane out of there.As with most Hotels in India it seems that the housekeeping is done by men. As a woman traveler we have noticed that there always seems to be an invasion of privacy at some point of your stay and at The Park there was a real feeling of staff over staying their welcome in your room, very pushy for tip's and filling in comment cards. Security staff would take your bags to your room instead of the porters and then promptly ask for a tip.Room service trays were not taken away and stayed outside our room for 2 days. Carpets in the rooms &amp; corridors where very dirty. Elevators had a mind of there own and you would spend 15 mins trying to get back to your room!There seemed to be a real lack of visable management &amp; when a rather large problem did occur it was handled very badly which left such a bad feeling that I would never want to return. Receptionist had a very unwelcoming approach and were not very efficient with follow up on details which again I think comes back to Management.The food was however very good. We had the buffet breakfast and room service which we found some of the best food in Delhi. Believe you me we have now tried a lot of the Hotels in Delhi and are still searching for the right one that we can feel comfortable to return to on our business trips to India. "
the park new delhi ,"Not that great My husband and I stayed in this hotel after staying in the overpriced Qutab Residency. This hotel was $300US a night which is also over priced. All hotels in Delhi seem to be overpriced.The outside doesn't look like much, but the lobby is quite intersting with a velvet ladies washroom, beaded curtains, etc. The front desk staff are quite nice and speak good english. However, it does take awhile to check in for some reason.The pool is very nice.The rooms look just like they do on the website, complete with a plasma tv and frosted glass walled washrooms. The shower is really nice with a lot of pressure. The bed is extreemly comfortable and the room is clean and modern.The breakfast is really really good and I believe is included in the price. We had supper here and it was terrible. The restaurant was called &quot;aqua&quot; I believe.Everywhere in India is expensive to stay. One really bad thing is our last night in this hotel we heard the thumping from the night club all night long that is on one of the first few floors. I actually had to wear ear plugs to sleep. We had to leave the hotel at 4am for our flight and the music was still blasting at that time. We liked the hotel, but didn't like the price, but all hotels in Delhi are expensive and you don't get value for the dollar. However, at least it is clean. Just try to get as far from the nightclub as possible. It is also pretty discouraging to look out your window and see the poverty from your glamorous suite below. "
the park new delhi ,"Way overpriced Hotel is waaaaaay overpriced for what you get. The Park Hotel was a minor step-up from a hostel. I will say that I think this is the case with many of the supposedly 'nice' hotels in Delhi. There are just very few (if any) mid-range hotels. I paid approx 250 USD, for a room that in the US would have cost less than 100 USD. For what I had come to expect in Asia, this place should have cost less than 50 USD.Decorations are simple and pretty, and the hotel looks clean and fresh, but the room is tiny, and the water quality is bad! Water did not seem clean, and after showering, I always had a satly residue film on my entire body. Towels were dingy, and floor was not sparkling clean.Again, this was not a bad place, but for what I paid, I wish I had just gone to the Taj. The hotel seems to be in a safe area. I am a female, and I was traveling alone. There are a lot ot men that loiter around the hotel, just not on the property per se. There was a bank/ATM next to the hotel, I was able to go there with minor harassment. I was also able to walk over to the mini-shopping center, again with some harassment, but not too much. Breakfast buffet was nice and flat screen tv had a nice picture, but too few channels. Hotel charges ridiculous fees to use their internet. At these prices, at least 1 free hour should be available to all hotel guests. "
the park new delhi ,"Beware - hotel tax SCAM At checkout - all guests find out that there has been a 12.5% luxury tax applied to their bill which is standard in India. The SCAM is that The Park applies the 12.5% tax to the RACK RATE not the room rate that we were charged. Our nightly rate was $168, but the luxury tax applied was based on a $300 room rate. For two nights, this was more than $75. This tax situation is never mentioned when you book your room or when you check in, you find out when you check out. We also stayed at The Imperial Hotel in Delhi - and they are doing the same SCAM to their customers, but in their case we were charged 12.5% of a $450 rack rate (over $100 for two nites), when our room rate was $189. This proves that the RACK RATES are randomly assigned and have no basis in reality. The hotel staffs say that everyone who checks out has the same bad reaction. Who wouldn't? This is unacceptable from any hotel, especially on this level.We will be reporting this unacceptable situatiuon to New York Times, Conde Nast Traveler and Travel &amp; Leisure magazines. "
the park new delhi ,"Funky We began and ended our trip in India at The Park. So, we stayed in two separate rooms. Both rooms had a funky, 60's feel to them. There was fresh fruit provided in the rooms - we ate the oranges --- dry and inedible. But, since it was an unexpected bonus, I wasn't really disappointed. The bathroom &quot;walls&quot; were frosted glass. So, modest people might be somewhat uncomfortable &quot;doing their business.&quot; Also, the light from the bathroom can be seen through the walls disturbing other sleepers.The lobby is small and was frequently crowded with tour groups.The breakfast buffet was included with our room - it was large and designed to appealed to international tastes.The lobby bathrooms, as with many in India, have attendants that expect baksheesh.Dinner was very good. But, smoking in restaurants is still the norm in India - and non-smoking areas were not available. With closely spaced tables, smoking was disruptive to our evening meal.Drinks were also unchanged since the '60's. Manhattans and Rob Roys are available. Requests for more recent concoctions such as Cosmopolitans or Mojitos are greeted with blank faces. But the staff also expressed a desire to try new things and was more than willing to make something that they never had before. "
the park new delhi ,"Loved the restaurant pool and staff! Park Hotel had a cool swimming pool area, which is lively on Sunday's. The rooms are contemporary, small but filled with all mod cons. The two restaurants are excellent - we went to Fire three times and were treated like royalty by the staff - the chef even came out with a complementary specially made desert for us on our last night. Staff go out of their way to help you have a great holiday. "
the park new delhi ,"Modern The Park is a very modern and trendy hotel. It does have a far eastern feel to it. the rooms are small, but comfortable. The staff attentive and very helpful. The only negative is the bathrooms which are v v small ,with a sliding door = with zero privacy. No bath tub pl note.The breakfast buffet was very good and its a good place to stay for a single corporate traveller.Definitely not for families . "
the park new delhi ,"Looks great in a magazine I'm sure! Average to stay at. The Park Hotel in Delhi must look great in some magazine. It must have won some design awards for its hip and trendy interior.Which is reason enough for normal people to STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM THIS MESS. Now, obviously as a luxury hotel, this is better than staying in a van by the river. and, truth be told, the rooms are quite good (we had a luxury suite or whatever). And, it's not exactly the hotel's fault if nouveau riche indian cybertreneurs insist on advertising their coolness by making a habit of standing in the hallway and talking loudly on their mobile phones.however, some things are the hotel's fault. For one, the lobby is an unmitigated disaster. it's loud as hell. it's chaotic. when i asked to schedule a trip with the concierge, i was taken into a smoky and junky back-office. the front desk staff is overworked and lacks a good communication system - they needed many things repeated (our check-out date) several times. people are standing around with luggage everywhere - it's cramped. it's just a bloody mess. fair enough - the 'new' park was built inside the concrete carcarss of an older hotel. but, it should have been done with people, not design awards, in mind.the restaurants are overpriced. I was charged US $150 for a bottle of wine that would cost MAYBE $15 at a wine shop - though the service was indifferent at best. the food at the outdoor restaurant was hardly worth the price - $15 cold pizza. Other food (room service) was better. The pool is made for looking good in some magazine - not for actually swimming. Considering that our bill with food was over $2000 for 3 days, I'd say you can do much, much better. A good hotel at this price would have us enjoying all of its amenities comfortably. Instead, we found ourselves hiding in our room from the rest of the hotel.Next time i'm in Delhi, I will try a different hotel. "
the park new delhi ,"Tricked by false website images... The website shows a really cool modern hotel with neat restaurant and bar. The truth - It's a run down old hotel with a modern lobby. We ate in a converted banquet room that felt like &quot;The Shining&quot;. Our room was darker and dirtier than a 1906's Howard Johnson. After complaining relentlessly about the false advertising, the manager let us stay in the 1 and only room that was &quot;designed&quot; as the prototype and used on the website. Granted, that room was cool, but the whole experience was a joke. "
the park new delhi ,"Very Modern and Chic! Stayed here for 2 nights split across a tour of northern India.Overall the Park is very clean, the interior and theme throughout is modern chic. The rooms are on the small side but still very nice and well equipped, all that you would expect. This is not a 5 star hotel as claimed, but would definately give it a 4 star status.The staff were friendly and helpful, and I was upgraded to a superior room on my second visit.The hotel is also in a good location and very central, Connaught place is a few minutes walk away. The only minus is that the bar is very expensive!Overall a pleasant experience. "
the park new delhi ,"Chic but small We just returned from two weeks travelling around India and were unsure where we would be staying our last night in Delhi...we were pleasently surprised to be at The Park...just steps away from the shopping of Connaught Place and the Government Emporiums...after an eight hour car journey down from the mountains we walked into a hip and bustling modern design lobby and were greated by young friendly desk staff...the room was also very modern and fun, even though we had one of the smaller rooms it was great...the only complaint, as other people have mentioned, was that the bathroom did not offer much privacy (and since we both had a touch of Delhi belly ....) Having spent the prior three nights in an old world Raj type hotel moving to the Park just highlighted the complex and beautiful spectrum that is India...with its maginifcent history and its current place as an emerging modern powerhouse...India seems to be all about extremes....since elections were going on and the shops were closed during the day and we had done our sightseeing on a previous stay in Delhi we had a chance to relax at the great pool with the giant disco ball and enjoy the outdoor space...definitely would stay here again! "
the park new delhi ,"Quirky and fun but... Stayed at Park for 4 nights at the beginning of March 07. On enteringthe hotel you are confronted by a bustling lobby that would look moreat home in an art gallery. Very modern, very chic. And this modernisttheme continues throughout all of the facilities on the ground floor.From the Fire restaurant (which I didn't eat at but is said to be very good) to the pool bar with its huge disco ball illuminating the goings on!The rooms are very pleasant and well equipped. Dark wooden floors, LCD TV, DVD player (library of discs apparently available on request). Strangely the bathroom wasn't up to the standard of the rest of the room and whilst OK, did look a bit out of place. The hotel location is great for exploring central Delhi but does suffer from being a bit noisy, as you would expect.I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and couldn't do enoughto make my business trip as pleasant as possible. Overall a very enjoyable stay. "
the park new delhi ,"Experience in Delhi Park - Awesome!!!! Soma, Would like to thank your team for their exceptional support that we received at DelhiPark!!!We had a terrible / horrifying experience at DelhiAirportpost we missed our flight to Bangaloredue to late arrival of flight from Jaipur. Will explain the details when we meet next time. We were stranded at DelhiAirportat about 8:30pm without any flights being available or any hotel booking. I tried reaching you but your cell was not reachable. The only thing that came to my mind was HotelPark, although I dint have the Delhicoordinates. I called Park Kolkata and spoke to Rajeev (The Lobby Manager â€“ on duty) and explained the situation we were in. He immediately contacted your Delhi Office and in 10 mins I got a call from Ritesh (Lobby Manager â€“ on duty). He immediately heard me out and confirmed a room for two of us and also helped us with the transportation bit.Post the kind of terrifying experience we two went thru and the way The Park Team helped us out was very reassuring!! I thought I should keep you informed about such a customer focused team, they just made our day after all that we went thru. Rajeev and Ritesh: Thanks a ton for your support. You just made it for us!!! "
the park new delhi ,"Good Experience Finding a hotel room for 25 people in Delhi is a challenge. We were very pleased with the Park, both in terms of the room, restaurant, location, and service. When a complication arose in our schedule, the hotel management went out of its way to accommodate our group. They even hosted a reception for the group to thank us for our patience in working through the scheduling issues. "
the park new delhi ,"Good base for a few days Plus: good location, smart staff, more realistic price than the 5*s if booked via the usual web agencies,Trendy interiors (flat screen TV, LED bulbs). Nice pool area deck.Cons: Glass walled bathrooms not completely private. Rooms not particularly spacious. "
the park new delhi ,"Overpriced but comfortable and conveniently located This is a very comfortable hotel, but like all Delhi hotels, seriously overpriced. This hotel would cost half the price in most other parts of the world. That said, the staff were very helpful and responded to all requests for service promptly. The location is good, with a park across the road allowing a peaceful walk and only 100 metres to Connaught Place. "
the park new delhi ,"Deserves a positive mention There is an obvious difficulty rating a property such as this when for the previous four weeks accomodation in Rajahstan has been generally of a much lesser standard. Having said that, it was overall a positive experience.The negatives - expensive food and beverage (but what's new?); generally overcrowded lobby; bathroom not adequately soundproofed from the bedroom (generally a problem with sliding doors); aggressive taxi drivers just off the forecourt (but likely beyond the control of the hotel).The positives - lots of staff who were uniformally efficient and courteous; good location; great beds; spotlessly clean; dinner by the pool; a spacious residents' lounge.We would go again. "
the park new delhi ,"Okay but Overpriced We spent 3 nights here in two separate segments, and it is a pleasant, 4 star place, even though it prices itself as something much better. The odd-numbered rooms (on the side facing the street)were much better designed than the others because the bathroom door does not open drectly onto the WC. Breakfast was okay if you were willing to wait ages to get a cup of tea or coffee: self-help was discouraged but was often the only option available if you had less than an hour free! "
the park new delhi ,It grows on you We stayed at the Park on the first and last nights of a group tour.First impressions of the hotel were not good with a brash foyer absolutely packed with tourists arriving and leaving-chaotic.However the room was super modern and spotless with space-age facilities.The english buffet breakfast on the last day was superb and very welcome after 14 days of curry.Would recommend highly but re-organise the reception. 
the park new delhi ,"They charge a lot for what you get You cannot criticize the hotel for the rooms. Although they are a tad on the small size the overall impression is very good. The hotel location is really good, within easy walking distance of the Tourist Offices and all the fancy shops in Connaught Circle. We also walked from here down to India Gate and the Parliament buildings without any difficulty or hassle. The problem with the Park is that they just charge too much money for what they offer. This is a good hotel, but not a 5 star hotel and they want a lot of money. The breakfasts are very good but you will find the bar prices to be absurd. The latter is quite common all through northern India by the way. 250-300 rupees is common for a beer whereas in Goa the price is 45-50. Funny thing, Goa is crawling with tourists but you will be surprised at how few tourists you see in the Golden Triangle. Anway we found that the Park liquor prices were higher than the Imperial which is very definitely a 5 or 6 star hotel, go figure.Don't fail to go for dinner at the United Coffee Shop which is quite close. Best food in India and very cheap. The Imperial has an incredible restaurant but prices are way up there.The heavy set tuk tuk driver who will press you a little bit as you leave the hotel is actually very good and quite helpful. 50 rupees goes a long way with these guys in Delhi. Beware the touts lurking around Connaught place. Virtually everthing they tell you will turn out to be a lie. "
the park new delhi ,"Really liked the Park Hotel We stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of a tour of Rajasthan. Contrary to reviews that I have seen, we found it to be excellent in most respects, the only exception being that in the evening we heard some drilling and banging from the floor above us - presumably where rooms are being rebuilt. We found the ambience, including ultra modern furnishings, pleasant and relaxing. The room was more than large enough, with the largest bed that I have ever seen - over 3 metres wide ! The staff were anxious to please and invariably smiling and pleasant - if there have been service problems in the past then the management must be working hard to address this.We did not eat dinner here but found the breakfast fresh and comprehensive.I would definitely recommend this hotel. "
the park new delhi ,"Better than the reviews suggest I have to say that I am quite shocked at all the negative reviews of The Park Hotel, it is in my opinion a great place to stay. Its possible that some of these reviewers are expecting the Shangrila or the Imperial, but I doubt if they will find a room at the same rate in one of those hotels. The Park is quite different to the standard Indian 5 star hotel. They have completely renovated the hotel to a very modern, but kinda funky style which is IMHO very refreshing. I'm not an expert on interior design, but its kinda like what a science fiction writer of the early 1970s would envision a hotel in the year 2006 would look like. If you've ever seen &quot;Sleeper&quot;, or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; you'll understand what I mean. RoomsThe rooms are admittedly a little small compares with other hotels in Delhi, but in all honesty, it really doesn't bother me, although I do understand why it might bother some. If you are looking for big rooms, this is not your hotel.The rooms are comfortable, although they are lacking perhaps a nice comfortable armchair, but thats probably due to the space factor. There are plenty of pillows on the bed which is perfect for me - saves me having to constantly ask housekeeping for more.There is a wide screen LCD TV in every room which is a nice touch, and there's also a DVD player, so bring some movies with you from home. I undertand there are films available from the hotel, but I didn't try.The bathroom is a very nice design, though as mentioned in previous posts the door is opaque which might bother some. Restaurants and BarsThere are 2 restaurants and 2 bars - Fire is an excellent Indian restaurant and Agni is a very hip bar. Mist is the standard hotel 24 hour restaurant (though very funky) and Aqua is an outdoor poolside bar. Breakfast is in Mist and is typical hotel buffet breakfast and very adequate.LocationCan't get much better for location - its right in the center of town, 5 minutes from Connaught Place. Its not set in acres of parkland like some other Delhi hotels, but those hotels aren't walking distance from shopping, restaurants etc like the Park is.ServiceThis is where I REALLY disagree with the other reviews. I find the service at the Park to be as good, if not better than other Delhi hotels. for example: I got a phone call at 8pm one night from the hotel sales manager who invited me downstairs to the bar for complimentary cocktails. He met me in the bar and introduced himself, and explained that he likes to meet with the hotel's guests. He was an extremely pleasant fellow, and was very open about the high cost of rooms in Delhi at the moment, and offered some advice on how to get better rates - not just at the Park . He also arranged a 6pm late checkout at no extra charge for me. Its treatment like this that will gain my repeat business, and that is what I call good service. Beyond that, all hotel staff is in my opinion extremely courteous and friendly. All in all, The Park is not super luxury, but it is still a very good hotel, especially if you appreciate things a little bit different to the ordinary.One thing to take into consideration - The Luxury Tax that is levied on all hotel rooms in Delhi is charged at the rack rate, not at the discount rate. This is a goverment regulation and has nothing to do with the hotel. "
the park new delhi ,"A mediocre hotel with terrible staff and service We booked for two nights on the hotel website. However, due to unforseen delays in India, we had to shorten our stay to one night. When we called the hotel to change our reservation, the manager on duty was arrogant and flatly told us that we could not change our reservation and we would have to pay for both nights. Inspite of being charged for two nights, when we checked in a day later than our scheduled reservation at 3pm, our room was not ready and we had to go for lunch to wait for our room. When we did finally made it to our room, a massive renovation of the corner floor was underway. The grinding noise and hammering was simply unbearable. When we called the duty manager to complain, she wanted us to understand that as the hotel was full, they had no choice but to give us the room next to the ongoing internal renovation. She appeared miffed that we could not appreciate her dilemma and assured us that the work would stop by 7pm and only start again the next morning at 9am. We had to call again to complain that the work was still going on past 7pm. The rooms albeit stylish and tastefully furnished with designer furniture and pastel color bathroom, were very small and designed with little regard for space maximisation. The food in the restaurant was mediocre for the prices. The staff at reception was disoriented and unfriendly. For all our trouble, no one cared and inquired as to how our had been. I would not stay at this place again. "
the park new delhi ,"Overpriced by at least 50% Overpriced 4 start property pretending to be a 5 starWhat strikes you the moment you enter THE PARK, NEW DELHI 's lobby is that the website fooled you into believing what it said! This place is definitely not 5 star. It qualifies for a good 4 star status. But for sure, not 5 star !The lobby is small, but clean and modern art-deco types (not my type for sure). The staff I found was prompt, and the lady who escorted my family to the room took pains to be courteous and pleasant. Good. The porter who brought the luggage to the room looked menacing, don't know why!The walls in the pathway (isle) of my floor were having stain marks which I first mistook as marble design!The room I paid for was deluxe premium, and it turned out to be quite small. They could have definitely made it much bigger than this, at least considering what I shelled out for it.The furnishings in the room are good, but you really can't enjoy it as the size gets to you. The semi-transparent (translucent)bathroom walls are a radical idea, and may not gel well with families.The food is way overpriced. I guess prices could be slashed by 50% to make it feel reasonable. We were not happy with what we got, and felt uneasy.Another important points : remember to ask if the hotel is undergoing renovation ? The lady who escorted us to the room when we checked in gave me 2 bad news --- Gym etc. are all under renovation, and there is repair going on through the day (so be ready for some noise). Why don't they mention it on their website? I may not have booked in this place had I known that the Gym will be closed!Overall, a plush 4 star property, way overpriced. At leat from an Indian point of view. "
the park new delhi ,"A very disappointing stay It was a very very terrible stay for me and my colleagues. There was absolutely nobody at the reception counter to guide us. We have been given wrong rooms. The staff was not at all friendly and some of them really misbehaved with us. Being a female, I was often taken for granted and even few staff tried to sexually abuse me. Over all avery bad experience. I will never return to this hotel anymore nor would recommend anybody to stay at The Park New Delhi. "
the park new delhi ,"Overrated - don't be fooled by the website I booked The Park on the basis of some positive guidebook mentions and the cool, contemporary rooms featured on the website. On arrival we were shown a boring outdated room in drab brown &amp; when I complained was told that only 2 floors have the updated rooms. I was then shown a contemporary room, it was tiny and the soft furnishings were stained. After protesting again that nothing I had seen so far was worth the rate I had paid I was finally transferred to a suite. This was glitzy (leopard print rug and gold headboard!) and v. large but not what I had originally hoped for.The staff were courteous and did go out of their way to accommodate us. On the upside the public areas of the hotel were elegant, it has a lovely pool area and bar and the location of the hotel is good. "

I walked in and though wow this is a interisting hotel, concept design inscents burning lovely. But then i went to our bedroom it was tidgey!, plus the porters took about 2hrs 30mins to get our luggage to our rooms, the food is rubbish, the service is extremly poor, the lifts don't work and the pool isn't even vaguely warm. Overall a very poor hotel which shoudl't claim itself five-star. "
the park new delhi ,check the bedding stayed here at beginning and end of tour of india.loved the food and the service in the restaurants was excellent. BUT on both occasions I checked the bedding prior to going to bed and found the sheets were soiled. The second time the soiling was of a masculine nature. I think you get the picture. Ladies be careful. 
the park new delhi ,I totally agree with Neil form London I totally agree with Neil from London concerning the service at The Park in New Delhi. I think he gives a perfect description of what it is like. 
the park new delhi ,"Disappointing!! The only positive aspect about this hotel is the location. It is a short stroll to connaught place but the place is surrounded by unscrupulous taxi drivers and touts (people who get a commission for bringing you to overpriced tourist shops) who make walking a bit of a nightmare. The room was clean and comfortable but very overpriced. The glass shower is ok for couples but can be a problem when used by a family. The serice is terrible most advertised services are unavailable. The travel desk is a joke, do not use them as they charge almost Rs3000 for a full day city tour when the going rate is around R700 in an ac car. I will definitely not be ripped off by staying in this place again. "
the park new delhi ,"Great hotel! This hotel is a haven in the madness that is Delhi! We spent 3 nights here and really enjoyed ourselves!The rooms are immaculately clean with lovely decoration, the bathrooms are modern and well fitted, with lots of freebies and a great power shower.The pool area is small but well kept and well designed - but be warned, the pool is VERY cold! There are 2 restaurants and a poolside snack bar - we tried all of them and were not disappointed. The food is of good quality, as isnt badly priced considering this is an expensive hotel. Obviously it is cheaper to eat outside the hotel - but definitley give the 'Fire' restaurant a go. Has a great bar too.The staff were lovely to us, nothing was too much trouble and we were always met with smiles!I'd say this was the nicest place we stayed in India - we were there for several weeks all around the northern region and goa.

the park new delhi ,"A little diasppointing On first impressions, I was a little disppointed since the lobby looked more like a glorified 3-star hotel rather than a 5-star hotel. However the room and bathroom were clean.On returning to the Park after an overnight stay in Agra, we had to change rooms twice on checking-in. This was not due to any fault on our part. The reason for this was that despite specifically requesting a non-smoking room both at the time of booking and at check-in we were given a smoking room. Although the room was changed we had to change the second time due to another problem with the room.Unfortunately for us this delayed us and we missed our engagement for the evening which we missed out completely since we were leaving Delhi the next morning. This was a little stressful for me.I have stayed in quite a few 5 star hotels around the world and I appreciate that mistakes do get made. However I was a little taken aback that there was no gesture made by management to acknowledge their mistake for example at least with a complementary basket of fruit.While the staff at the Park are very pleasant and helpful, I don't think I will be rushing back to the Park on my next visit to Delhi. "
the park new delhi ,"Surreal experience Quite a surreal hotel due to its ultra modern sterile interior. Great service, lovely pool, good food. However I couldn't help feeling that I could have been anywhere in the world due to the bland interiors. I suppose it is great is you want to escape the chaos of india outside its walls. Denim clad waiters, glass bathroom walls, Terance Conran interiors. If you like the above ambience then this is a great hotel. "
the park new delhi ,"Plenty of promise but poor service and staff attitude disappoints... This hotel really has so much promise - but I'm afraid I'm unable to write a positive review due to the poor attitude of the staff and resulting low levels of service. From the moment we checked in, the service was very average - rather than greeting customers with a smile, it seemed to me that everything was a bit of an effort for them. The staff at reception did not genuinely want to help - for example, when I called up with a question about their Internet service, they were quite unhelpful - instead of putting me through to someone who could help, they seemed more keen to get me off the phone.Unfortunately it's not only the reception staff who need some urgent training - the service at breakfast was equally as poor. The hotel appears to employ so many staff, however most of them were just milling about talking to each other, rather than serving the guests. On some days, we had to wait for a table, as whilst the table was free, it had not yet been cleared and re-set. For the rates charged by this hotel, the breakfast quality was extremely poor with not enough variety in the menu each day. Many items ran out regularly and were not refilled quickly enough.The room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and whilst it was generally comfortable, I'm not a big fan of the nouveau styling. The sliding bathroom door doesn't have a lock, and whilst the bathroom looks nice, the strange shaped washbasin isn't particularly convenient to use. The LCD TV in the room is a nice touch, but signal quality wasn't up to scratch and quite grainy on most channels. Also, the hotel won't provide an extra bed in the room - only a mattress. We managed to convince housekeeping to provide two mattresses stacked one on top of the other, however it's still not particularly comfortable.So, my overall opinion of this hotel is poor given the fairly high room rate. They really need to make some urgent improvements in the area of customer service! "
the park new delhi ,"Perfectly Fine Hotel My son and I stayed at The Park for two nights and thought it was a fine hotel - although a bit pricy. It's definately over-the-top as far as modern decor goes including glass-walled bathroom and art in our room. In the bathroom, both bars of soap had ONE flower pedal layed carefully on top. Good shower, but the matress was typical (hard) for India. Great pillows, though. We ate in the casual restaurant for dinner and had very good food (pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven). Didn't get to take advantage of the pool area but it was beautiful. No issues at all with noise. Service was fine. We found that English is not spoken as fluently in Northern India, and this being our first stop up north, we thought it was the staff (some had a hard time understanding what we were asking for), but that's just the way it is (as compared to Southern India).

the tivoli garden resort ,"Cheap mentality management - Tivoli Garden This is bull (----) resort, their spa doesn't work, swimming pool is in bad shape, they offer membership at a cost with certain facilities like 50% discount on food and when you go their they say the same has been withdrawn. One of the worst ever experince of my life. They charge membership fee and then go back from their words. Bloody cheap mentality management. These kind of people can not grow in life, who cheat people. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"room's decent..service non-existent It's a fairly large property and the main reason to stay there was because i was having an event there. The room's are pretty decent in size, bathroom is fairly spacious with a shower cube and a bathtub but the bathroom fittings are pretty bad. Hot water isn't always available especially at odd hours. Air-conditioning works but my colleague who was in another room wasn't so lucky. Room service is ordinary. My cable didnt work and i had to get a technician in for that. The same 'technical' problem was there with the key card access. The good part is the closet space which is good, bed was comfortable, it had plug points by the bedside so easy to charge ur phone thru the night and yet have it next to u. Restaurant isnt that great, b'fast is ordinary and like i said..the service..forgettable. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Great if you like cold showers.... First impressions (of the room) were good, but after an hour or so you notice the shine has gone. Couldn't guarantee hot water, the sunken batch in the bedroom is literally a waste of space. People kept knocking on the door early in the morning too making a lie in impossible (didn't have a &quot;do not disturb sign&quot;.OK for business trip perhaps, but found it way over priced (even with the discounted price as it was the same venue as the wedding we were attending.Ho-hum. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Good clean hotel with great staff perhaps could do with a bit of a revamp We stayed in this hotel for two nights as part of a Golden Triangle tour around India. Was very impressed with the security at the hotel and the foyer and outside areas were really nice. Service was great throughout our stay. The rooms were very grand (we had a bath in our bedroom), although there was a rather thin sliding door which opened the bathroom up to the main bedroom (therefore little privacy!). The hotel was incredibly clean and the restaurant served very good food (although at UK restaurant prices). The rooms were very spacious and comfortable but maybe a little dated, I prefer the modern 4 star hotels we get in the UK, and this was more like a traditional uk hotel that perhaps could do with updating - but still very grand. There was a wedding whilst we were at the hotel and reading the other reviews this appeared to be a problem for many, we however were not disturbed by this at all and in fact really enjoyed watching it as it gave us an additional insight into Indian culture. "
the tivoli garden resort ,Terrible hotel worst service and staff We had a wedding at the Grand Ball Room at Tivoli in December. The hall was unclean and the stage had very dirty carpet and a broken couch. Please avoid this place at all costs - if you need more info then contact me at this email address - TivoliGardenDelhi@gmail.comThe Accountant Sudipto &amp; the Caretaker Kataria just dont know their job. The whole property is poorly managed and the toilets are blocked and there is no water. The access to the hotel is so congested that it may take you 30 minutes to just cover couple of miles. 
the tivoli garden resort ,"Not quite value for money We have just returned from a couple of nights at theTivoli. The hotel is new and the service is reasonable. We stayed in two rooms for a family of 6 with 4 small kids. The restaurant serves reasonably good food and a buffet breakfast is included.The pool is lovely but small. The pool attendant and staff were good with kids and generally quite helpful.We paid about £130 per night .There were double beds and a large sofa bed so a family of 4 is easily accomodated in each room. The details in the rooms were disappointing for the price. The showers didn't work properly, neither did the a/c and our airport pickup didn't show up.Overall I would say this is not quite worth the money and airport access is poor due to local congestion.Alwyn. Leicester UK "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Awful; avoid at all costs Where to start? The rooms aren't clean, the bedding is rough and uncomfortable, the pool is filthy, the food is mediocre-to-poor, the front desk staff are rude, and it's in an awkward location. And because it seems to cater to the wedding crowd, the music and running of feet down corridors goes on till the early hours. What makes it worse is that it's not even cheap. With tax I paid about 7,800 rupees (around $200) for the one night I stayed here, and that didn't include breakfast or transportation, or even a bottle of mineral water in the room (only two opened bottles of filtered tap water in the fridge). Unless you're a guest at a wedding there, avoid this hotel like the plague. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Mediocre Hotel not a resort GOOD POINTS:Beautiful lobby, nice looking &amp; clean room, nice poolBAD POINTS:Often noisy when there's a wedding or other outdoor event. May be difficult if you need to sleep.Breakfast selection is spare.Unfortunately, foreigners can expect to get the third degree at checkin. Supposedly, the 50 questions are due to FRO office security requirements. They're just doing their job but it's not a friendly.Hotel location is considered the outskirts of Delhi, so some tour guides want to charge extra for the distance. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"I liked it I liked this hotel. Hotel is very beautiful and clean and rooms were big enough.Hotel staff was nice and polite.Food was clean and delicious. The hotel arranges parties (fore example weddings, birthday parties and business meetings). So it´s not peaceful at the weekends, but if you wanna see beautiful Indian gowns and see how Indian people celebrate, it doesn´t bother you.The hotel is not a typical tourist hotel. There is not anything for children and mostly visitors spend there just couple of days. The hotel is suitable for adult tourists, who are not searching for a quiet and peaceful time, but want to get to know Delhi.The distance between this hotel and Counnaught Place or Old Delhi is quite big and there is lots of traffic. So it might take 45 minutes to get to those places.I was a tourist from Finland and enjoyed the time in this hotel! "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Avoid at all costs First impressions were not good,the hotel is about 40 minutes drive from the airport and a long way from the centre of Delhi.If you aren't used to India beware it is in a very poor area on a dusty smelly and very crowded main road..We stayed here for 10 days and our problems started from the moment we walked through the door.I was asked to sign a credit card slip for over 45,000 rupe(over £500)despite the fact I had already paid by credit card to the hotels booking agency the month before.Trying to explain this to the reception staff who spoke poor English proved difficult and despite the fact that I had seen the debit on my credit card before I left for India they refused to believe I had already paid.We went for a meal in the restaurant while they sorted it out and I was served the wrong meal and told my chicken on a skewer would be with with me in no time at all.They kept their word but the only problem was that the chicken was raw inside and inedible.We returned to reception and although nothing had been resolved with the booking agency we were shown to our room which was very small compared to previous rooms we had stayed in on visits to India.The toilet is also connected to the bedroom by a louvre window which is not very hygienic and offers very little privacy.The window does not open and felt very claustrophobic.Being jet lagged we decided to have an early night and were woken up at nine thirty by what sounded like a loudspeaker at full volume in the bedroom.A wedding party had started and it continued until gone 2 o'clock in the morning.The guests continued milling around the hallway and talking loudly until well gone 3 O'clock.The cleaning staff start work at around 4 O'clock in the morning and make no effort to be quiet.We recieved a call from reception at 8 O'clock asking us if we were going to breakfast.We staggered bleary eyed into the restaurant and had 2 fruit juices,a coffee and two slices of toast.As we left we were chased by the waiter who told us we needed to sign for breakfast.I aked him why as breakfast was included in the price.he said I was mistaken and presented me with a bill for 750 rupees which is over £8The booking agent had informed us that breakfast was included in the price and we went to reception who refused to acknowledge this despite the fact that I showed them the booking confirmation clearly stating that breakfast was included.We wasted a good hour at reception trying to sort out breakfast and the hotel refused to budge.Normally in India this would not be a problem,breakfast for two is no more than £1 at most,but as there was no where to get breakfast locally this pesented a major problem especially at £8 a time.We were told that the only day we were entitled to breakfast was on our last day (which was the first of October because we had paid £100 for that night).As we had to leave at 3 am to get to the airport this wasn't much help.We felt like 2nd class citizens during our stay at the hotel.and felt like they believed we were rich westerners trying to fiddle them.The sheets were only changed every other day and that was after we complained to reception and on one occassion were blood stained.We never recieved our free cookies or water either.I suffered from a bad case of Delhi belly towards the end of the holiday.We had returned at midnight from a trip to the taj and after 18 hours on the road we both just wanted to have a shower and go to bed.I turned the shower on and nothing happened.I phoned reception and was informed the main water pump was broken but would be fixed within the next twenty minutes.An hour later still no water,two hours later it still wasn't fixed.When you are suffering from a really bad case of gastro believe me the last thing you need is a hotel with no water.Not one of the toilets in the hotel would flush.There were wedding parties seven of the 10 nights we were there and getting a good night's sleep was impossible.The hotel puts it's commercial customers first and as I mentiond earlier we were made to feel like 2nd class citizens from the moment we first walked through the door.We finally resolved the problem of the credit card payment and it transpired the had overcharged me by about £40 and ended giving me back money.I've stayed in 2 star hotels where the service was beter than here and unless it's a last resort dont stay at this hotel, especially as it's very expensive by Indian standards at £100 a night. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Take note - not all it seems We have just returned from a holiday in India which included two stays in this hotel, at the beginning and end of our trip.The hotel is set in beautiful grounds, with large rooms BUT it is not really a tourist hotel. Its main business is in catering for large scale functions especially Weddings and they have been know to have as many as 7 Weddings going on at one time! This in itself isn't a problem but it does mean that there were often areas which were off limits to residents. Of the 5 nights we spent there the &quot;Pub&quot; was being used for private functions on 4 of them. The restaurant was closed on one occasion( but the Pub was open)! The food was good, the staff were lovely (with a couple of exceptions) but......Our contract with the Hotel included Breakfast but at the end of the first stay we were charged for Breakfast and despite all reasonable attempts to sort this out one of the management was adamant that we had to pay! His attitude was not very pleasant and on our return 11 days later he neither apologised or made reference to the matter despite it being dealt with by the agency we booked through. The room details also included cookies, along with the tea and coffee but these never materialised. Additionally bottled water had to be bought - the hotel supplied water in bottles but as these weren't sealed you couldn't be sure where the water came from. This was not a major expense but every other hotel provided at least some sealed bottled water. Another point which wasn't clear when we booked was that the hotel is a minimum of 45 minutes from the centre of Delhi and a taxi is the only way to the centre.So if you're going to India and thinking about staying in this hotel then bear this in mind - nice place but do you want to be the only tourist in a hotel? "
the tivoli garden resort ,"We loved it We were nearly put off after reading a previous review of this hotel. However, we found that it was clean, and well maintained. We loved the pool which was clean. The staff were helpful and we enjoyed the resturant. The chef even cooked a special curry not on the menu. There were functions taking place every day and night and for us it added to our India experience with wedding and engagment parties. Although there were so many people milling about we were not disturbed at night at any point. It was slightly out of the City Centre but the hotel Taxi costs us approx £15 to hire for 8 hours so if you want to sight see then this was a great way to do so.We would recommend this hotel, the price was excellent, middle of the road which is often difficult to find in Dehli. "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Great hotel been back twice We stayed at the Tivoli Garden Resort for 1 week during end December 2005. This was our 2nd trip there and we love it. It is a boutique hotel/resort. This resort is primarily a banqueting place with many weddings, functions, conferences being held. They have about 40 rooms - so it is a small-ish hotel in terms of # of rooms. The rooms we've stayed in are beautifully apointed and done up.The food at the restaurant, Marbella is great. All kinds of Asian, American,Italian and Continental cuisine is served and the quality is good too. There is a very nice nighclub at this resort called Trafalgar Square. There are very nice, beautifully manicured lawns. Very personalised service. The best part of this hotel is that you feel you are out of Delhi (i.e away from the pollution etc) yet you are centrally located and are close to the most happenning/hip shopping places. Overall, both our stays here have been very good and we definitely plan to return "
the tivoli garden resort ,"Terrible time at the Tivoli Garden Resort I would avoid this &quot;resort&quot; at all costs. We stayed for a week, and based on the fact this is advertised as a 5 star resort expected a high level of service. Things were bad for so many reasons I will bullet point them in order to keep it short:- This is more of a banquet hall than hotel... there are 4 separate function rooms that seem to be constantly booked, and the noise is unbearable. Indian parties don't tend to start until around 9 pm, so don't plan on sleeping before 2 am. And you better be ready to be up at 5 am when clean up starts. Granted, it depends on where your room is located, but this is unacceptable in ANY room.- The front desk staff had trouble understanding basic questions in English. - The pool, located next to one of the banquet areas, had a layer of greasy film on the top (from the food service) and cocktail sticks on the bottom. Additionally, it looks as if the pool bar has never been used. And we were excited about the pool bar.- The room construction is shoddy. We could hear the people next door to us pushing their chairs back/forth on the hardwood floors. Also, the showers didn't drain properly and constantly soaked the entire bathroom floor.This place was simply awful. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone. "

uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Poor service and overpriced We booked a &quot;day room&quot; at the Uppal Orchid in order to have somewhere relaxing to crash near the Delhi airport before a 4 a.m. flight for the U..S. Though Uppal reservations had told our Indian travel agent at booking that we could stay in our room until we needed to leave for our flight around 2 a.m., once we checked in about 9 p.m., they reneged. Instead, we were forced to check out at midnight and sit in the lobby until our airport transportation arrived, which was not a lot of fun.In addition, we found Uppal's restaurant Bonito's to be overpriced and mediocore. Cannot recommend. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Satisfying Experience This hotel is near Airport providing complimentory Airport Transfers if Room/package is booked. Hence, its good for Air travellers who end up paying very high charges for transport in Delhi. Staff is very co-operative. Initially, I was allotted a room where A.C. was not satisfactory and upon requesting the staff, they alotted me a room o higher category and with better A.C. Cooling. During my period of travel, hotel's some part was under renovation that has effected menu of the coffee shop. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,Ideal hotel near Delhi airport Was perfect for my overnight stay to catch a flight in the early morning. Good relaxation. Prices are possibly high but not unexpected for a 5 star hotel. 
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"The place is a plain and simple Rip-Off. I stayed here for two nights. The food choice was terribly limited, food was nothing to write home about, and food prices were exorbitant. The food quality and service was bad too. In the price of laundering a day's set of summer clothes, you could buy a fancy cotton-linen shirt! The place is poorly connected, and miles from a public area where you can find transport. Their official travel desk is again horribly expensive. On the second night, there was virtually no water in the hot water taps - just a trickle. The fake-period bathroom fittings are so bad that if you open both the hot and cold water taps, the cold water starts backing up into the hot water line. I'd stay away from this place. Yes, and please go over EVERY item of your bill and double-check. In my case, the travel bill was added twice. The staff made a commitment about complimentary pickups and drops, then denied it and only agreed with great reluctance. "

uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Great Hotel This is one great eco friendly hotel located very close to IGI airport New Delhi. The entrance and approach of the hotel is very nice. The service is also excellent. The only problem was theat my Airtel mobile was not getting signals except in the lobby. It was not working even in the restaurants. Secondly for a business traveller is it quite far from the city center. However, over all its an experience in itself to stay in this great property. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Nice and Quiet a few difficulties I stayed here on a business trip for a total of 7 days (4 days, left for 3, then returned for 3 more). The hotel is very quiet and well kept given the dusty area and closeness to the airport. Every morning there were several workers sweeping the floors and watering the plants. The gardens and pool area was beautiful, though not very enjoyable in the extreme heat. The few difficulties I experienced were:The first room I stayed in would only play the sound from the tv through the speakers in the bathroom. When I asked the hotel staff, they said there was nothing they could do. Also, the internet access was extremely difficult to access (though I found it was similar at every hotel in India) as it took several phone calls to the front desk and 2 employees visiting my room to get met connected. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Terrific airport hotel What a pleasant surprise! A quiet airport hotel, very close to the airport, with the most beautiful gardens and swimming pool and an excellent breakfast too. We very much wished we could have stayed to enjoy the pool and gardens which contained a wide variety of trees, shrubs and plants. Walking in the gardens after breakfast was a total delight. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"A green haven in the centre of Delhi. Arriving off an overnight flight we needed a place to rest before taking an evening train. Our Agent suggested Uppal's Orchid would suit us as it has ten acres of grounds and a pool. He was spot on.Despite arriving 04.30 our room was ready and we were made very welcome. The bed was soft and welcoming and sleep then ensued. Refreshed, we enjoyed the 10 acres of gardens with its pool and plentiful birds etc. The whole experience was seamless and pleasant. A light snack by the pool was our only opportunity to judge the cuisine but it passed with flying colours. Later we bought some snacks to take with us on the overnight train and they were also very wholesome.Our only regret was that this was only a day rest and we did not get the opportunity to sample the Restaurants and other facilities.Just 15 minutes from Indira Ghandi airport this place is highly recommended for a peaceful stay away from the bustle of Delhi centre. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"convenient airport location Good rates available if you book via the website.We used this hotel as it's a stone's thrown from the airport. We arrived at the crack of dawn and booked a room so we could do straight there at 5am and sleep until check-out time. It was great in this respect, especially as there are free airport pick-ups and drop-offs. It saves you lots of hassel when you're arriving early.The facilities at this hotel are great - the restaurant is suprisingly good (Chef &amp; I) we were quite taken aback by the quality of the cuisine.The pool is huge and really nice - we went for a swim late afternoon and had the place to ourselves.I was disappointed that I'd paid extra to have a room with a balcony. We arrived on our way out of India for 2 nights stay here to find the door to the balcony couldn't be opened until 24 hours after we arrived. When it was opened it was covered with mess from the pigeons. Housekeeping did clean it while we were out but it was still unusable. The hotel manager came to find us while we were staying and I did mention this to him but he didn't suggest compensating me for the inconvenience. I also mentioned it on checkout (at 6am in the morning) and the woman at the desk said she'd mention it to the manager but still charged me the full rate. I will definately email them and follow this up but am disappointed that the staff weren't pro-active about it.The rooms are comfortable, spacious and clean and it's definately worth booking in if you arrive on an early or late flight. We left a bag here while we travelled in India, which they were happy to store for us with no charge. We used the hotel on the way in and out of Delhi. If it's in your price range I would definately suggest it's worth it. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"excellent Fantastic stay, we were only there for such a short time and really never got to enjoy the grounds....about 1 km of gardens and a great spa with gym access. If you are staying it is a nice resort. The restaurants were really good too. Rooms were nice. It is really in the middle of no where....near to the domestic and international airprot and that was our reason for this hotel.People were very friendly, ...also remember one thing they all expect huge tips....We also rented a car for the day, which worked out just fine. We got a driver by the name of Jitu he was great. Enjoy! I would recommend this place. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Three Weeks in New Delhi I just returned home from a three week business trip to New Delhi. My stay at the Uppal's Orchid was rated as above average solely based on the kindness and courtesy of the staff. Although there was a language barrier, often times taking two or three tries before communication was clear for both parties, the pleasant personalities and willingness to try, made the experience a positive one. Every staff member I met in those three weeks was friendly and helpful (with one exception...always one rotten apple, right!). They all learned my name; they learned my schedule... so if I was late to breakfast one day or home late from the office, they knew it and showed concern for me. That is a good feeling when traveling alone in India. The room was nice with two exceptions... The bed was rock hard and the shower was set up so that you had to climb in, literally, and turn the shower on while in the tub... the cold blast of water each morning was ... well, more powerful than a cup of coffee. At least, the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The climb out of the shower was quite challenging also, slippery and I always pictured myself breaking my leg or head on the hard marble floor of the bathroom... take it slow, if you go.There was always, at least, two bottles of complimentary water in the room, one in the fridge and another given with turn-down service along with some nice chocolates. Try to request a room overlooking the pool. My co-worker was on that side and enjoyed peaceful nights... I, on the other-hand, had the court-yard side of the building... Well, on the positive side, I got to see two beautiful India weddings and what I believe to be a huge, Bollywood party... but as for sleep, I had a few occasions where some event was taking place and music was blaring through-out the room. It didn't really bother me since my hours for the office were late anyway... and the weddings were an interesting experience.I had issues with the food in India generally... In the beginning, I enjoyed the local cuisine but it got too hot &amp; spicy for me and when I just wanted the basic American style food, there was nothing that really satisfied me. Even the basic Club sandwich at the hotel, was not you average American Club sandwich... I guess I knew that it would be like that, but three weeks was too long for me to go without the comforts of home. All of the service people in the restaurants and room service were wonderful and efficient and so friendly, so meals were enjoyable in that way... and the India food was good for the most part. I learned about chicken Tikka in the third week which was prepared mild and tasted like basic roasted chicken... I ordered that a lot of the time towards the end... The Samosa's were not too bad, some spice but tolerable... and the Bruschetta with a side of fries, was just enough to satisfy me most days!The breakfast buffet was good. They had an omelet station that made eggs to order and pancakes, too. That was good for me... they also had both continental and Indian breakfast items in the buffet. I did not really use the pool and other facilities but everything looked nice. The grounds are beautiful and quite pleasant to take walks... and as their hotel guide book says, they have &quot;foggings&quot; twice a day... I didn't really find insects to be an issue. The pool was quite large and had a swim up bar.... And the spa facility had reasonably priced services but I did not partake. It was a little Garden of Eden. and if you are a first timer to India, as I was, you feel guilty after driving around Delhi, with the tent villages, and beggars, dust &amp; pollution, etc only to return into this little oasis of a hotel. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Serious problems -- book cheapest rate not a 'Leading Hotel' Booked this hotel through Leading Hotels of the World site, and so, paid close to $400. Huge mistake! Front desk staff person was rudest I have encountered, treated my wife and I as if we were going through an airport checkpoint. No &quot;hello, welcome to Uppal's Orchid,&quot; just &quot;passport!&quot; &quot;business card!&quot; &quot;how will you be settling the bill!&quot; Granted, we didn't look like Bollywood stars after just getting off a plane from Goa, but money's what's supposed to talk in a five-star, and our reservations were made a month in advance. Also, if you book through Leading Hotels site, you pay top dollar but in return are supposed to get fringe benefits like automatic room upgrade, late check out, bottle of wine, free gift, etc. At other hotels, we've been given everything from two free one-hour massages, to 6 p.m. checkout, to an Italian leather portfolio, to fresh flowers. Or all those things, plus more. We don't view them as entitlements, but Uppal's Orchid clearly isn't taking the program seriously -- we were shuffled straight to closest room off the lobby on first floor and assured it was a &quot;superior room,&quot; with no upgrade. Air conditioning didn't work, teapot didn't work, staff refused to open our (locked) private balcony for us at 8 p.m. (the next morning, when we wanted to eat our breakfast out there, we discovered why -- it hadn't been cleaned in weeks and was covered in pigeon dung and feathers. We had to make two calls to maintenance to clean it, and even then, all the guy did was whisk a duster over the table). Finally, we were begrudgingly given a one-hour late checkout.All that said, the room was small but nicely appointed. The pool and swim-up bar are nice, and we enjoyed them the morning we left. The grounds are lovely. And when, after paying the full bill, I asked to see the manager to discuss our disappointment, I had a half-hour discussion resulting in some compensation.So -- would I stay here again? Yes, but not via the Leading Hotels of the World system. Uppal's Orchid doesn't qualify. If you want LHW treatment, go to the Taj Mansingh (Taj Mahal) in the city. I would book Uppal's through an aggregator like Priceline or Travelocity and try not to pay more than $200 a night, especially because of its location in the middle of nowhere between Delhi and Gurgaon. And enjoy the pool and restaurants -- the Chinese one is spectacular. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,Very very nice quit hotel During the beginning of February 2008 I did stay at the Uppal's orchid. I was very happy with the service/food and specialy the very friendly staff. The people at the restaurants do an excellent job. They make your stay extra nice. The food at the two main restaurants is very good. After 12 years visiting India I did not have a single problem with my stumic.The hotel is absolutely on 5 star level. Some people where negative after they stayed at the Oberoi in Agra. This is something you should not compare. The Oberoi in Agra is close to six stars and very expensive.One point of comment. At the lobby (coffe bar with nice sweets) the is a small band playing. Normely you give them something when they play. This band is not touching any music notes. So I give them some roepies when they agreed in stop playing.I compare this hotel with the other 5 stars in Dehli. Absolutely OK.try also the small golf court nice......!!I will go back there... 
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Nice Quiet Hotel The main reason for my decision to stay here was its proximity to the airport, but actually, it was not that close to the airport. But the shuttle service was free. The hotel itself is not located on a main road like most other large hotels, so it was very quiet. In addtion, my room was facing a courtyard, which was nice. My room was clean, and reasonably sized.Women who frequent India might have noticed this, but the shampoo hotels provide (even at a nice hotel like this one), will completely strip oil from your hair. I carry my own shampoo and conditioner when I travel in India.Since I arrived after 10:00 pm, checked out early in the morning, I didn't get to see exactly what the property has to offer, but I did utilize their fitness center in the morning. It was very mordern, and had nice treadmills and weight machines. They also had a nice looking pool outside. For 5 star hotel in a big city, the hotel was reasonably priced. I would difinitely consider staying here again. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"good place for families with young kids We had a very pleasant stay here at the end of a month-long trip to Nepal, Bhutan and Delhi+ environs. Nice way to finish the trip. I almost forgot I was in Delhi!! Room was modern, clean and quiet. Grounds are peaceful, with lots of room for the kids (both aged four) to run around. Great buffet with something to please everyone. The children's pool was excellent.... just the right temperature. The staff were very welcoming of, and attentive to our little girls... gardeners picking flowers for them, etc.If I was pressed to say anything negative, it would be that the staff doesn't have quite the grasp of English that you would expect for a hotel that clearly sees a lot of foreigners.... e.g. we would have to repeat ourselves three or four times very slowly to get across a fairly simple point, and likewise we would have to ask the staff to repeat themselves so we could understand. But this was a very small issue.... a great stay overall. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Outstanding property near the airport We stayed here for our last night in India because of the location close to the airport. This is a lovely hotel, set in large grounds with every amenity you could need. A huge swimming pool, gym, choice of restaurants and nice bar. The room was lovely, well appointed, great big bed, air conditioning that worked, nice bathroom with a lovely shower. They claimed that the tap water was drinkable but provided plenty of bottles anyway. The bistro type restaurant had a buffet in the evening with many different types of Indian food (and non-Indian too). The quality was excellent. The hotel has a car and driver service if you need it. every bit the 5* hotel they claim. They also claim to be an 'Eco' hotel, although I am dubious about that because it did not seem to be any more eco than any other 5* hotel (and importing Evian water from France certainly isn't!). That aside - highly recommended. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,Quality Property This is a beautiful property. Our room was well appointed and in line with 5 star rating. Only regret is that we only could experience it for one day. 
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,An oasis in India Amazing service and friendly staff. Loved the property!!! Especially the &quot;Chef &amp; I&quot; restaurant. Thanks for a great two weeks!! 
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Close to the Airport The main reason for staying at this hotel is its proximity to the airport. Most international flights arrive and depart in the wee hours of the morning. Being just 15-20 minutes from the terminal is convenient whether you're arriving or departing.The rooms are centrally air conditioned, are large enough, and are well appointed: TV, mini-bar, desk and chairs, small sofa. (About half the rooms look out on the hotel's nice garden/courtyard.) Bathrooms are good-sized, have all the toiletries found in better hotels, and provide ample hot water for showering or bathing.The restaurant is nothing to write home about; but its breakfast and lunch and dinner buffets are ample and an a la carte menu is also available.The business center has several computer with high-speed connections.Check-in is quick and efficient as is room service.Unlike other luxury and near-luxury hotels, Uppals Orchid rarely has taxis or tuk-tuks lined up waiting for fares -- and one can wait a long time on the road in front of the hotel for an empty vehicle to come by. The concierge, however, will call a taxi and one will appear 15-30 minutes later. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Rubbish After a magical week of staying in the Taj properties in Rajasthan and the Oberoi in Agra, our final night before our flight home was spent at this hotel. This was a huge let-down - desk staff weren’t particularly friendly and were just going through the motions, pool staff looked miserable. As we had an early morning flight we were given a room right next to the main lobby. All night in the run up to our 2.30am departure you could hear banging doors and neighbours talking loudly in the next room - the noise would appear to travel through the air ducts. At 2am there was a bunch of guests in the lobby just wandering around aimlessly, talking loudly and slapping the piano keyboard - infuriating if you happen to be right next to the lobby especially since the reception staff didn't seem to care even when we pointed it out to them.Thanks to the energy saving light bulbs - the room looked dark and as cosy as a garage. But of course you can live with that in the name of eco-friendliness! However, the eco-friendliness didn't seem to apply throughout the hotel. For instance, the air-conditioning unit in the restaurant was set unreasonably low, happily pumping more greenhouse gases than strictly necessary.You could sort of turn a blind eye to the above if you were staying in a 3 star hotel and not paying very much. However since the hotel claims to have five stars and to be a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, I feel the comments are justified.I would not recommend staying at this hotel. If you have an early morning flight you will probably be able to get to IGI from the Taj Mahal hotel in Delhi relatively quickly and will be well looked after and get some much needed sleep before you travel. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Good hotel Stayed at Uppal's Orchid for 10 days on a business trip March through to April. Overall the hotel was very good, rooms where very nice and clean, serviced every day and they turn you bed down at night and leave chocolates on your bed.The restaurant's were also good, overpriced for Delhi, but cheap compared to UK prices. The food was of a high standard with a varied menu, the only criticism I have would be the service could sometimes be a bit slow, you would wait quite a while for your starter and getting your bill could be a bit of a nightmare.The pool area was really nice, gets quite busy at the weekend as families from the area come here, they have memberships for non hotel guests.Getting the complimentary car arranged to pick someone up from the airport was hard work and they charged them for it so watch out for this. Some of my colleagues also had some bother with their rooms, they put them in a deluxe room as they did not have any other rooms available even though they had booked. This would not have been a problem but they could not unpack for 3 days as they had been told that they could be getting moved any day to the normal rooms, they told them after 3 days they would be staying in the deluxe rooms. The hotel is not far from the Airport and about a 20 minute drive from Gurgaon.My company has regular trips to Delhi and I would recommend any other colleagues to stay at this hotel. Some of my other colleagues stayed in the Raddison and Uppals was much nicer its a lot smaller than the Raddsion and quieter. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Good hotel excellent service good food above average price I stayed here for almost two weeks on a business trip March-April 2007, with several other colleagues. The Uppal Orchid is about 20 minutes from Delhi airport and another 20 minutes from Gulgaon, which is host to a lot of off-shored and outsourced operations, including corporates such as Microsoft, Citibank and Sapient. It's no surprise then that you see a lot of business people here, air crews and airport transfer passengers. So not exactly the place you'd stay as a tourist. It's 1-2 hours to central Delhi, depending on the chaotic traffic, and- I'd question your reasons for staying here if you're not on a company expense account. That's probably the reason for the high prices. The Hilton further down the road costs the same or slightly more, and caters to the same kind of traveller.Having said that, if you're here for a business visit, this is a comfortable, well maintained hotel. Staff were falling over backwards to please, and to the Western traveller the attention is almost startling.Here are some pointers for you, if you're considering staying here:1. Internet connection - costs about USD20 / GBP10 a day, but has been very reliable and never let me down. There will be a network cable in your room that you plug in, and once you are given your access code you're up and running.2. Environs - not a lot to do around the hotel, which is an oasis of greenery in the midst of dusty suburban neighbourhoods. Even so, if you're a keen shopper, you're a 20 minute taxi ride away from the malls of Gurgaon, where you can find cheap bargains of almost anything. If you're back from a busy day at the office you're much more likely to stay in and have a nice meal or sit by the pool. The 10.5 acres of grounds are also very well tended and green - and you'll have a good jogging trail if you're after one.3. Food and drink - the restaurants in the hotel are excellent, and the bar provides a good selection. Prices are more Western than Indian - so not at all a cheap eat, but quality is very good. Their Sunday brunch buffet is excellent, with unlimited alcoholic drinks, at about USD30/GBP15.4. Rooms - there are premium rooms facing the poolside with little garden balconies (some of my colleagues got those) and standard rooms (I got one of them). I have no real complaints about the standard of the room. There's a safe, a TV with plenty of channels and the usual international provisions, such as mini-bar and coffe making facilities. It could have been a hotel room anywhere in the world for all I know. Beds are comfortable (and firm).5. Monster mosquito alert: this is not specific to the Uppal but beware: if you leave your windows open mosquitoes will get through, and you may be eaten alive. Being paranoid about Malaria I kept mine closed, some of my colleagues still have bite marks several days after... This is especially true for the pool-side rooms, where close proximity to water sources is a godsend for mozzies. The hotel sprays the grounds every night at dusk, to try and help a little.6. Electricity - my Indian colleagues tell me that they are used to power cuts in Delhi, every day, sometimes for prolonged periods. The sheltered guests in 5-star hotels here (including this one) only experience a mere second of a flicker, before the generator kicks in. 7. Water - the hotel claims the water here is safe to drink, but I haven't tested this claim. You are still provided with a free bottle of mineral water every day. 8. Gym - there's a small gym next to the pool. I wouldn't say it was cutting edge, but did the trick for a workout.9. Getting around - at Indian prices, it will probably make sense to book a car with a driver for the day, or if you're a corporate guest, get your hosts to arrange it. It seems ok to get a cab to take you away from the hotel, but not so trivial to get back. Drivers will often not know where the hotel is, and will have to ask random rickshaw drivers several times on the way. Addresses are not straightforward in India, and saying that it is &quot;On National Highway 8&quot; is not too helpful either. If you're in Delhi proper it's even worse, because most yellow/black taxis don't have a licence to travel to Gurgaon - so you may find yourself a little stuck. If all else fails and you can't get back - get to the airport and find a taxi that will definitely know the way. And whatever you do - don't drive here yourself. Unless you're suicidal, that is. 10. Eco credentials - The Uppal Orchid claims to be an &quot;Eco-hotel&quot; with much fuss about how it is environmentally friendly. It does recycle its water and tries to encourage its guests to save energy, but the general impression I got was that this is more a marketing spiel than a mission statement. All in all I enjoyed my stay here. It is worth remembering, as you drive down the dusty roads to take you wherever you're going from here, that maintaining this kind of Western make-believe standard must be hard in all the chaos around it. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Near the airport - OK(ish!) 4 stopovers 10 days traveling in India, staying in 5*+ Oberoi's etc, our travel agent dumped us in this dump for 2 nights before we left Delhi. I forgot to check here if this hotel was OK.The rooms are tremendously overpriced (US$362!) and not clean. They were noisy (outside traffic + neighbouring room) and felt 'run down'. Very depressing after a glorious 2 week tour I can tell you. We upstix'd and stayed in a downtown Taj hotel for &lt;US$200. Negotiated directly with hotel.As another reviewer said, the only redeeming features are the airport's proximity (but then again if you have an early flight, transfers from most hotels are &lt;30 mins); and some of the staff are genuinely service-oriented.Avoid unless you have a good $ deal and need somewhere to freshen up for a few hours before jetting off. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Wonderful place We turned up at this hotel after having booked a 3 star hotel somewhere in the depths of Delhi that was terrible and that I couldnt bring myself to stay in.I must say that on arrival at this hotel I was left without doubt that this hotel is 5 star in everyway possible. The grounds are beautiful and the swimming pool and pool area are perfect to relax in and unwind. Our room was very beautiful and the shower and bath both immaculate and with good water pressure. All staff were so nice and polite, I actually found they tried too hard! When walking down a corridor in the hotel one day there was a staff member vacuming. When he saw me he turned off the vacum and almost stood to attention as if I was some form of royalty. I cant fault this hotel.After reading some of the reviews I am quite shocked that people have found so many negative things to say.The TV had a good range of channels, we exprienced one power outage for a couple of seconds but thats India! The food was good, room service very good!Its location was fine and we were tourists and we managed to get about perfectly well. The hotel has high charges for tours to the Taj but then what 5 star doesnt!I dont feel that there was anything poor about this hotel at all and after staying in about ten 5 star hotels this year I would definately say this was the best without a doubt, I loved it! Its definately 5 star luxury! "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Excellent experience I was surprised to read some of the negative reviews of Uppal's here, as my experience there was nothing short of fantastic. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly, rooms were well-maintained, and the restaurants were above my expectations. As an example of the quality of the staff: I stayed here for two weeks on business and the restaurant staff offered to make meals for me off the menu so I wouldn't get bored of the food. Also, when I suggested that they add breakfast items to the late night menu, this was taken care of within days.As mentioned before, the hotel is convenient to IGI Airport and most of the office parks around Gurgaon. Probably not where to stay if you are a tourist, but perfect for anyone doing business in Gurgaon. The gym is basic but rarely crowded, so would meet most needs. There is also an outdoor tennis court, very nice pool, and the small 9-hole putting course. The business center offers internet or there is broadband in the rooms. Showers had good water pressure and hot water availability. Short power outages were fairly common, but that is pretty standard for India and they only last about 10 seconds, so it wasn't a big deal to me.To address an earlier reviewer, the TV has quite a few English stations (BBC, Star Movies, HBO, Star World, ESPN, Discovery, etc), so no complaints there.All in all, this is a fine place to stay where you will be well looked after. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Not worth the price - Not 5 star I stayed at Uppal orchid on business for 2 weeks in January 2006. First room they assigned me was overlooking the highway and loud. I got it changed to a inner room which was acceptable except for the elevator noise in the nights.There are two restaurants, one chinese and the other one essentially Indian/Western. Items on the breakfast buffet (breakfast available only in the Indian restaurant) were usually dry, especially the south Indian dishes. You could however order eggs cooked to your style and freshly made. Indian dinner dishes were quite oily. The food was definitely not 5 star, it's more like 2. Service at the restaurants was very disorganized. There were 4 or 5 waiters asking you the same questions (what would you like to drink, eat etc) and taking orders again and again, very annoying.Room service was very prompt, so was laundry service. Cleaning crew did an ok job in the toilets, I had to ask them to clean the tubs a bit more every now and then. Couple of mornings the water pressure in the shower was down to a trickle, I was told it was something to do with the power failures.Don't book travel through the agent at the hotel. The guy would not refund my money ($100) I paid him for a trip to the Taj Mahal. The trip was supposed to be in a luxury coach, but in the end it was a very small, shaky and loud diesel van. I cancelled and rented a mini-van. Extremely uncomfortable. Also, the tour van/buses don't pick you up from the hotel. You have to go to one of those real 5 star hotels (like Taj Palace) to board the bus. And they charge almost $50 just for a ride to those pickup locations. The whole thing is not professionally run.The hallway leading up to the gym stunk like a cheap motel, even though the gym itself was alright. It's nice to walk their small garden, at least the part away from the diesel generators. The putting green is really small.Cable TV was mostly Indian (hindi) channels. BBC and Deutche Walle were the only western ones.It's close to the international airport. But the drive to the city center may take upto 2 hours depending on traffic. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Problems at Uppal'sOrchid I used to like Uppal's Orchid because of nice facilities, friendly staff and competitive rates. However, since luxury visitors to Delhi have increased by leaps and bounds, all hotels are always overbooked. So they can afford to command a higher premium because visitors are desperate to get rooms at whatever price. Uppal's has unfortunately embarked on this tendency and is getting as expensive as the Oberoi Grand in Delhi but not as nice. What's worse, they are doing such price gouging with loyal repeat guests, as in my case. So, if I must pay a higher rate, and if rooms are no easier to get at Uppal's than at the Grand (usually means booking months in advance during winter peak), I'd rather stay at the latter with the satisfaction that yes I've paid through my nose but I'm staying at the very best. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Modern Hotel Close to Airport We stayed at Uppal's Orchid upon arriving in Delhi. It is a short drive from the Indira Gandhi International Airport and is located in a secluded estate. The hotel has the feel and atmosphere of a modern, four-star Western hotel. Our room was lovely, with a spacious bathroom. We had dinner at the Indian restaurant in the hotel's lower level -- excellent entrees with the choice of a buffet as well. Breakfast the next morning was also very nice -- a very well-stocked buffet, although the eggs were a little cold.If you are staying in Delhi for several days and want to be close to the city's center, this may not be the hotel for you -- you may want to try hotels at Connaught's Square. (Note, however, that Delhi is a very dispersed city and you are never really close to anything.) However, if you are arriving from or departing from the airport and want to stay close by, this hotel is an excellent choice.Our only complaint involved a lengthy wait for a cup of coffee at the hotel's cafe next to the lobby.NOTE: Try to avoid flying into or out of Delhi in the latter half of December and the first half of January. The city is afflicted with heavy fog that creates major flight delays and cancellations. We had to adjust our schedule and lose a day in Delhi on account of the fog. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Good service but missing the basics We had 2 rooms at Uppal's Orchid during our vacation to India in Jan. 2006. Both rooms were upgraded to a Club Room with jacuzzi jets in our bath tubs. However, not many people must use these rooms. After our first night, we woke up to no power at all in our room. No lights, no heat. After a call to the front desk, it appeared to be fixed, but then the power was off again for a short period of time before power was finally restored. The 2nd room had no hot water. We were in a hurry to catch a flight at the airport and this did not start our day off right. After waking up the 2nd day, both rooms did not have hot water. They sent in a technician into our rooms and fixed the problem. Before I went to bed, I set the thermostat for 23 degrees celsius when it was currently at 19. I woke up to the thermostat reading 17 degrees. Another technician was sent into the room to fix the problem. One of our phones was not working and they had to replace the phone. All of this for a supposedly &quot;5 star hotel&quot;. I've done a good amount of travelling and I've never had to have a technician have to come into my room ever to fix something. Basic things like power, heat, and hot water should have been tested out and fixed prior, especially since they were club rooms at a 5 star hotel. We were not given any consolation for our experiences, only an apology from the manager on duty. Despite all of these issues, the food at the restaurant was good, the service was very good as the staff tried their hardest to keep us happy, and the pick up and drop-off at the airport was fairly smooth. I would recommend going to one of the chain hotels like Hyatt, Radisson, or Intercontinental instead. We had also stayed at the Intercontinental at Nehru Place previously on our trip and had a very enjoyable experience. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Location the only selling point What's good about Uppal's Orchid is that the room and its contents behaved as advertised; the food in the buffet restaurant was pleasant and offered good variety; and most importantly, the commute to the airport is mercifully brief.Otherwise, I found the hotel wanting in several key respects. At about US$150 per night, one gets an environmentally correct US chain hotel e.g. a generic Marriott or Sheraton. In India that should cost you about 1/3 less than it does. If you are happy to pay that extra cost for the feeling of environmental correctness in a country that sorely needs it, you may not feel pricing to be as inflated as I felt it to be.Another major issue was transportation. I requested a taxi to take me to the airport for an early (5:30 AM) check-in. I was first told to make my way to the front desk to arrange this; a few choice words then convinced the staff member that in fact I was paying for somebody else to do the walking for me. In India, full service is quite standard. There would not have been such back-talk at the Oberoi, it would simply have been done.When it came time for me to board my taxi in the morning, the driver quoted me a price nearly triple the standard fare for what is about a 15 minute ride at that time of the morning. Upset at such a crude attempt to price-gouge, I went storming up to the front desk. It was then that I found out this taxi was in fact not for me, but had been ordered by another room for a drive outside of Delhi. But the hotel clearly didn't care enough to help me make sure I had the right car, and the driver of course was happy to swap customers as long as he made his 300 rupees. About 15 minutes later, a second taxi appeared and the sleepy driver bundled me off to the airport with meter running.Uppal's seems to have acquired enough steady business flow to skimp on its service while maintaining something of a room price premium. If you just want a clean place to sleep near the airport and you don't care about taking a DIY approach to everything else, you might like this place better than I did. I was expecting some value for money, and the value was gone by the time I finished dealing with staff laziness. "
uppal s orchid an ecotel hotel ,"Attractive Hotel---BUT------ When we checked in, we were told that transportation to airport and &quot;early breakfast&quot; were included. The early breakfast consisted of a greasy muffin. We had settled our bill the evening before since we had a 4 amflight. However, we were accused of &quot;using a computer&quot; in our room and the manager was demanding additional cash--all this while we were awaiting our &quot;free&quot; transportation which turned out to actually cost $12US extra. We finally convinced them that we had no computer to be using in our room. Outside, we waited and waited for our driver. Finally, the driver arrived at a time to suit him because he was on his way to the airport anyway to pick up some people coming to the hotel. We barely made it to the airport, security, and customs for our flight home! "

velvet apple ,"Good location clean but noisy Location : nice, 20 min from India gate. Safe area, quite green, and not on a main street . The overal area is mostly residential.Room : relatively large (around 20 sqm), and clean. Wifi is a great advantage. Hot water and electric supply at all time, which is an advantage in India. Includes safe, iron, air conditioning, ...Price : around 50 EUR/night, including breakfast (by the way really nice and sufficient in quality). A daily bottle of water is also complimentary.The major issue I encountered is noise : rooms are well isolated from street and from neighbour room. BUT the doors are extremely thin, which makes that you can hear anything that happens in the corridor, or inside the room right in front of yours. Really incredible... I had to use hearplugs to sleep, which is unpleasant.This is really a pity, as the staff is quite helpful, and rest of the accomodation fine.Smaller disadvantage : rooms on the ground floor have strictly no view (on a dark backyard), so far from website pictures "
velvet apple ,"Velvet Apple - A good stay We stayed at the Velvet Apple hotel for 6 days in early October 2009. The hotel is located in one of the better areas of New Delhi and is close to the M Block Market (500M walk) and other small shops.The staff were very obliging and very pleasant for the duration of our stay. The room that we stayed in had ice cold air-conditioning and a really fast ceiling fan. The hotel is located in a very relatively quiet part of GK1, New Delhi. This is due to the fact that there no intersections within close proximity of the hotel. This is an important consideration in your hotel choice as people constantly use their horns in New Delhi, especially at intersections.There were many channels available for viewing on the in-house TV channels. We especially liked the Australian Network channel. One one the outstanding features of this hotel was the complimentary Wi-FI offered by the hotel. This proved to be a God send as calls from our mobiles cost approximately $6.60 per minute. We used this service and communicated by email for the duration of our stay. The WI-FI connection was fast and reliable at all times. The breakfasts and room service in the hotel were good. In summary, the hotel was good value for money and we would stay there again if we needed to go back to Delhi. "
velvet apple ,"Great hotel in Delhi perfect for both business and leisure travel We spent 3 nights at this fabulous new hotel in a convenient part of Delhi, near enough to shopping and restaurants, but far enough to be feel like we were going 'home' at the end of a busy day. The staff is courteous and prompt. Because Velvet Apple is a small, boutique hotel, the staff gets to know you and is very willing to meet your individual needs (they made us custom breakfast and lunch daily). The property is clean, with tasteful room decorations and all the right amenities (small fridge, flat panel HD TV, great bathrooms). Right across the street is a local park which gives you a glimpse into how 'real' people live. Although we were traveling for fun, plenty of business travelers seem to make this hotel their regular base, given how familiar they were with the staff. It is definitely close enough to the downtown business areas. Seems like a much better alternative to the large, impersonal chain hotel options. "
vivek hotel ,"Bad start at the Vivek We arrived in Delhi at around 4am and were picked up by the Vivek staff. On arriving at the Hotel we asked to see our room before paying. We were shown a horrible, dirty room. The bed was a short, misshaped double with a thin bit of grubby foam for a mattress, a window was hanging off, the bathroom looked awful. We had booked a standard, not economy room, on the strength of photos on the website. We expected te actual room not to be as good as the photo, but this bore no comparison. We were shown another room that was much better, a (worse) variation of the photo on the net but was told this room was 1200R as opposed to the 650R agreed online. We managed to argue the manager down to 800R for the better room but felt we had been conned. It wasn't a good start to our first India trip after 24 hours travel, it made us expect to have similar problems at other hotels, luckily this experience wasn't repeated. The resturant was quite nice. Staff were friendly, food fine, relaxing atmosphere. "
vivek hotel ,"Indeed the worst hotel in India I agree with mharley86 - the hotel is awful! The staff was not friendly, we arrived at 1.00 am and the check in was a real absurd - we had to pose to pictures holding our passports by our faces :// All the rooms we have been shown were dirty and sordid, before we entered the man from the hotel kicked off bags with rubbish. I guess they have various rooms, but the ones we saw and the one we already took were horrible... When I saw a new Vivek webpage, I thought I was going to die from laughing - it seems to be at least 4 star hotel!Last year I heve been had... "
vivek hotel ,Value.. Travel to delhi often and not on a very high budget. Its basic and clean I think they are refurbishing so ask for the newly renovated rooms.. Its got a nice restaurant and is centrally located.. cant ask for more for the amount I paid..Cheers.. 
vivek hotel ,"Worst hotel in India Really, this hotel was completely awful. We arrived in Delhi at 4am, and were met at the airport by someone holding our names on a sign, as we had paid the hotel for a taxi pickup. However, all the guy with the sign did was call a taxi for us, which took nearly 30 minutes, and it was a complete rip-off as it was more than double the price of our return taxi to the airport. Having to wait for 30 minutes after travelling for 20 hours at 4 in the morning wasn't great either. The hotel was a complete dump, with the manager insisting we had to fill out all the forms there and then despite how tired we were, not letting us see the rooms and insisting we had to pay up front for our stay. We were so tired we decided to chance it, which was a massive error. The rooms were absolutely filthy, unquestionably the worst we found in India (we travelled in India for a month). The 'air-cooler' didn't work, the shower was non-existent, in one of the rooms the toilet didn't flush at all, and there were bugs everywhere. When we complained we were met by shrugs and indifference by the manager, who clearly did not care at all what we thought of his hotel. The rooms were so hot and disgusting we gave up trying to sleep and got the earliest train we could find to Agra that day. I'm pleased to stay that every hotel in India after Vivek was much better. I've travelled to Morocco, Australia, and throughout South-East Asia, South America and Europe, and I've never encountered a worse hotel than Vivek. I could not more strongly recommend that other travellers avoid it. "
vivek hotel ,"Great for backpackers... We stayed in a so-called luxury room which was ok to stay at. It was clean, had tv, a fridge and a/c. You could also use the internet (for a few rupees) and book a tour to the Taj Mahal in the hotel's travel agency for a good price. The hotel is located in a busy market street near Connaught Place. There, you can get anything what a tourist's heart desires - from saris to henna tattoos. However, I would recommend not to eat at the hotel's restaurant and instead look for an alternative e.g. at Connaught Place. "
vivek hotel ,Good for a cheap central stop over The location is good and we were picked up by taxi as promised. We had a club room with a quite new bathroom (room 103) but it did not have a window. The check in is slow but the staff were helpful. Sam's cafe on the roof was a good place to eat and it is being made bigger. I think this hotel is a safe bet for quick stop overs in and out of India (I stayed for the first and last day of my trip only). If you want to chill out in your room go somewhere with a window but pay more. 
vivek hotel ,Indifferet views but a good hotel.. Indifferent views but a good hotel..I was a bit apprehensive before booking this hotel because of the indifferent reviews I read but I took the word of a friend who stays there a lot. I arrived and my room was booked and the check in was smooth. Then in the morning I ordered room service and it was slow but the food was good.I really liked the restaurant its clean and serves up a few good dishes.. I suggest this place to my friends an the readers .. Cheers.. 
vivek hotel ,"Value for your money A number of previous reviews seem to be very upset with this hotel and i think that is mainly due to people not expecting what they find in Pahar Ganj --- a wild whirling mass of people, smells, shops and food!!! It sounds fantastic but be warned, this is most densely populated part of Delhi (in a city / country with existing population problems!).The Bad news : Almost all the hotels are old and score very low on cleanlinessThe Good News : The entire area is geared to the foreign tourist so you shouldnt have any problem getting things to eat, wear and show-foff :)Also, you have a lot (hundreds!) of choice in this area. So if you have the time, book into any hotel for 2 nights and then shop around and you'll find something perfect for your budget.Oh wait, i forgot that this is supposed to be a review of the hotel. The hotel itself has seen it's days, but if you can afford one of the newly furnished rooms (Rs 1200) then you should be quite comfortable.The rooftop restaurant is very good as long as you stick to good ole Indian fare... although they do have a wide choice of palatable western dishes too.And despite the previous reviews i found the service to be warm and friendly. In fact, I had booked online for 4 nights but arrived 2 nights late. I thought the money was down the drain since it was too late to ask for a refund, but they quite willingly upgraded me to a better room!I think the previous reviews have made them change what they can.... for the better. "
vivek hotel ,"Vivek hotel do not stay in this filthy dump We arrived late at night at delhi airport and were met at the airport as arranged by someone from the vivek hotel. Then things started to go down hill. The man who had been paid to meet us was constantly pestering us for a tip. When we arrived at the hotel it was filthy and the room we had booked was nothing like the pictures on their website. It was filthy, dark , dingy and damp. So damp in fact the camera lens was misting up each time I took a picture. The corridors were full of old sinks and bits of rubbish. We were offered a better room but at double the price. It was 2 oclock in the morning so they had us over a barrel. We stayed one night and found another hotel the next morning. I have stayed in a lot of budget hotels all over the world and can in no way be described as fussy. This hotel can best be described as a filthy rip off dump. "
vivek hotel ,"Just ok We booked the Vivek online from home and brought a printout of the email confirmation with us, but still got cheated on the price! We arrived and they took us to our room. When my husband went down to check-in and pay, they told him the price was much higher than our email agreement. They explained that we were in a better room. We never asked for any particular room, or course (and this one wasn't great, believe me!). He bargained them a bit lower, but we still ended up paying more than agreed to by email. Welcome to India, I guess, but it was frustrating. They hotel is well-located and fine enough, but we found a much better place in Cottage Yes Please just down the block a bit, which has an amazing veggie South Indian place across from it (Malhotra's Dosa Please) that is much better than the restaurant next to Vivek. "
vivek hotel ,"Terrible rooms - good location Really interesting to see how different people rate this place. We were clearly not expecting much, but compared to the other hostels we stayed in during our holiday in India, this was the worst place and actually closer to a 1-star than 2-star rating. If there are renovated rooms as described in other reviews, we certainly did not get one. The staff was quite uninterested in our well-being, and the food was below average. Better visit the small restaurant 50m down the road where the Indians eat too - much better food for half the price! "
vivek hotel ,"Value They gave me one of their renovated rooms and I loved it. Spacious, clean and well furnished. Service is good and the Hotel houses a cafe called Sams, exceptional food. You would be pleasantly surprised. Thumbs up! "
vivek hotel ,"Good basic hotel with great restaurant I had read a lot of bad things about this place on here, but it was the only hostel recommended by both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet. I was pleasantly suprised with the hotel. It was basic, but the service was friendly, the room was good and clean (we went for deluxe), and the beds were perfectly comfortable.The restaurant was good and you got nice views over the rooftops. "
vivek hotel ,"Simple but Clean Hotel Vivek was recommended by a friend since I was traveling into New Delhi and needed to catch a train the next day. It was simple, clean (by Indian budget guest house standards) and was reasonably priced for the room.There was some confusion at the front desk as to whether or not I paid when I arrived (which I did)- so keep the receipts they give you, just in case. It's in Pahar Ganj (aka the hell realms), but the food in the roof cafe (Sam's) is safe to eat and there's a variety of foods.I wouldn't vacation here, but it was fine for just passing through New Delhi. "
vivek hotel ,"Better than many of the reviews We stayed at the Vivek Hotel 3 weeks ago (April 2009).After reading many of the reviews we were pretty skeptical, but as it turned out, despite pretty hard beds (which are common in India), we had nothing to complain about.We arranged an airport pick-up months ago. No problem.The pick-up price was what they said. We booked a CLUB ROOM that was clean and the bathroom was fine.As regards the criticisms, don't book any standard under a club room, or you will get what you pay for from what I hear.Sam's bar on the roof makes the whole thing worth it, believe me.It is a real oasis. Ice cold beer. Great service. Good food.The location, right in the middle of Pahar Ganj on the main bazaar was exactly what I wanted for my first time in Delhi. Exposed and in the middle of the madness.No, it is not the Ritz.The hallways and stairwells are still undergoing a developmental process (don't worry, it was still quiet) and it is not a standard comparable to decent motels in the west, but, if you just want a decent, clean, air-conditioned, and what we felt was a safe lay-over for one or two nights in the middle of Delhi it was fine, especially with Sam's Bar/ restaurant on the top. "
vivek hotel ,"I thought it was ok.. Ok fellow travelers..this hotel is a ok.. its clean and the bathrooms are CLEAN ..(hard to find a clean bathroom in budget hotels in India). The restaurant is ok too its inexpensive and the kitchen is an open one so it seems clean too. I have been traveling for 3 months in India and would recommend this hotel. I paid about 800 Indian rupees for my room for a night. Nice market outside and the metro station is around the corner, but beware of people coming at you to sell you stuff you don't need... oh and there are cows on the road too.... "
vivek hotel ,"Don't trust Vivek hotel I was budget traveling for 7 months and the Vivek hotel, by far, was the worst place that I stayed. They cannot be trusted...period. They never showed up to pick us up at the airport. They gave away our room that we had reserved months earlier. (They had one room left that was so beyond gross and miserable that we were unable to even sleep the first night). They claimed we did not pay for our room. They were trying to make us repay. I finally found the receipt they had given me. They did not make any apologies but instead said that I was a good girl. (What does that even mean?) This place had a variety of room from pretty nice with A/C to something resembling a Thai prison. Just because you make a reservation for a nice room doesn't mean that is where you will end up. Their word mean nothing. Also, even though the rooms are nice, everything else about this building is pretty grimy and gross. I have spent a few months in India and anywhere else is better than this. Please avoid and do not support these people that are unsavory bad people. "
vivek hotel ,"Don't stay here. A rip off, unfriendly, untrustworthy, unwelcoming, lacking of any charm place to stay.We had booked a pick up from the airport which was not there when we arrived. There was no record of our booking even though I had emailed and called several times to confirm. When we got a cheaper pre-paid taxi to the hotel we had a very unwelcome greeting and a man who showed us 3 awful rooms which we picked the nicest at 1500inrs. I wish we had stayed elsewhere. Sam's cafe was ok and had a good view of the main bazaar but was also really unfriendly. Food was average.When we checked out, the receptionist had the cheek to try and make us pay for the taxi which didn't turn up and they had no record of the numerous conversations/emails I had made/sent. He even went through the name cards from that day to prove he had been there but couldn't find it!Stay elsewhere! "
vivek hotel ,Unfriendly Upon arrival on January 1st all the staff could offer two people was a small room with no window - at 900 rupees. Asking for a room with a windomw the next day just gave us a cold shoulder and upon checking out we had to haggle for a refund of the deposit paid for the second night. 
vivek hotel ,"A complete rip off We booked a room at 400 rupees by internet because our plane arrived at night in Delhi and we wanted to make sure we had a room. When we arrived, the owner insisted to make us pay the taxi. Just after he announced that he only had a room with AC, for 1400 rupees ! We told him we had sent him several emails to make sure he kept a room for us and that he said he would, but he did not even apologize. Another girl was in the same situation. He finally agreed to lower the price to 1200 (already extremely expensive for the kind of room !) but we left, very angry. It might be a good hotel, but the owners are not the kind of persons you want to mingle with. "
vivek hotel ,"Good value budget hotel Booked a room with them weeks before, with several emails between us, but when we arrived they didn't have a record of us and our room. But we were able to check into a double room on the third floor for 1000rs - a/c, fan, TV, double bed, clean towels and toilet paper, new bathroom which was very nice and clean - but hot water had to be arranged with them rather than just turned on with the tap??!!. They are doing up the hotel, so the hallways are full of wooden doors being varnished, and pots of paint. It needs decorating as in parts looks very old and run down, but our room looked good. Only had a tiny window in it so didn't get any views, but it was light and smelled ok.Hotel had room service, and a restaurant upstairs - food seemed ok and cheap. No alcohol, but the man in the hallway would offer to go and buy you some for a small fee and then bring you back a warm beer 20 minutes later!!There is an internet room downstairs, which takes a copy of your passport before you can use it, as part of the security due to bombings in the area and the link to internet cafes. The check in also includes copies of your passport and a photo of you on their security video.Location of hotel is good, on the main bazaar, with some very cheap shopping. Its close to the station, and they can arrange a car to the airport for 250rs (other places in the area will do it for 200rs). The main bazaar has a strange security system at either end, with police will make you walk through metal detectors and then search your bags, but if you are in a rickshaw you just drive straight through. It really depends on how they feel that day whether they can be bothered to search you.The hotel was a good one for the one night we stayed there, in the right location and cheap enough for an a/c room. "
vivek hotel ,"Clean rooms and great location Having left the Rak International we moved into the Vivek hotel on the Main bazaar. We were shown various rooms of various prices on the first floor. We were shown cheaper rooms on higher floors but went for a nice room with A/C. All of the rooms seemed recently renovated and had clean bathrooms. In fact this was one of the cleanest hotels we saw in India. However the A/C had a strange smell, possibly because of dirty filters.The hotel is right on the Main bazaar which means it’s close to the New Delhi train station where you can catch the all important trains to Agra (to see the Taj Mahal) and Jaipur. Both trains leave early morning, and this hotel is literally minutes away from the station. Incidentally go straight to the international ticket office on the 1st floor to buy these tickets. It opens 8am-8pm (2pm on Sundays), and ignore the people that tell you it’s closed down/being renovated, and direct you to their friend’s/brother’s travel agent.The hotel has Sam’s Café on it’s roof, with great views of the city. It serves various dishes, including breakfast but beware the “hash browns”, they are not the American version, but boiled potatoes cut into cubes and mixed with onions and peppers. Also recommended is the Kitchen Café not far away on the same street.Hotel staff ranged from polite and helpful to surly and business like! They did arrange a taxi for us to the airport for 250 rupees. They also have internet.We paid 1200 rupees for a double room with A/C and en-suite bathroom. There was no breakfast included. "
vivek hotel ,"Vivek - untrustworthy The a/c rooms are nice and the food decent and cheap. There are minimal creepy-crawlies, which is a bonus in backpacker Old Delhi. It's a good location near the train station and the market. However, we don't trust the owners. They seem out to make a buck rather than take care of customers. We booked through their website, including a ride from the airport. The ride never showed (we heard another couple complaining that they were being charged for a ride that never showed). Also, they didn't have our reserved room; instead, we got placed in the sketchiest room on the top floor. We eventually got upgraded to a nicer room, but they also raised the price on us from what the website said. When we reserved the same room for our return trip to Delhi 12 days later, they didn't have that record either, even though we gave them some money up front. Until we showed them their own hand-written receipt, they didn't believe that we paid them in advance. Then we got a smaller room for the same high price. I just get the impression these guys take reservations but allow anyone to stay when they arrive and would charge you again unless you can prove otherwise. We are seasoned travelers and have our cultural expectations in check, but when people smile at you and say something, and then turn around and do something else, you can't trust them. And trust is all you have when traveling. I have no idea how this hotel has been in business for so long. By the end, we unfortunately trusted no one there. "
vivek hotel ,Loved the WiFi in my room.. Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights..They have a wide range of rooms ov different cost..had a nice stay the staff was friendly. I had issues with the Taxi i took from the airport to the hotel the staff was helpful enough to deal with the overcharging the driver for me..The food is nice you can catch a bit ov sun on the roof...The have WIFI which was nice i used my laptop in my room which was a plus.All in all it was a good experience.. I would recommend the hotel for a cheap place in delhi.. 
vivek hotel ,"vivek hotel avoid it! We stayed at the Vivek hotel in Pahar Ganj in November last. We chose it because we wanted to be in the middle of the busy bazaar area to experience the atmosphere of Delhi. All I can say really is avoid it unless really desperate. We emailed our booking and had requested an airport pick up which they claimed to offer- it never materialised.When we arrived they didn't seem to have our booking but that was ok because they had vacancies...... with good reason. The room we stayed in was filthy, noisy and did not feel at all safe. There were men hanging around on each floor and in the reception area constantly for no apparent reason. My husbands sandals were stolen from the room! need I say more. We moved after one night to the Ajanta which was much nicer but also much more expensive. We consider ourselves accustomed to backpacking and staying in rough and ready places all over, but could not possibly recommend this place even to seasoned travellers!ps the restaurant in the Metropolis hotel up the street was great! "
vivek hotel ,Loved the restaurant.. Friendly staff.. a decent enough place to stay in .I stayed there 3 nights..paid rs 350 per night .Room was clean and had an outside window.They have a nice terrace restaurant which is not to be missed...all in all a pleasent stay... 
vivek hotel ,"Give it a miss Hi all, i have just stayed in the Vivek Hotel but checked out the next day. i went just up the road to Hare krsna Hotel which was way beter for a cheaper price. Vivek was a little expensive and the rooms are just filthy. Not maintained at all. The bathroom walls are grimey. There was even some clothes left in the bathroom from the previous tenant. Where as where i am staying now, it is so much better and clean.My opinion... avoid Vivek until they start cleaning their rooms. "

york hotel ,"great I couldnot forget my stay with hotel york. I had a good time over there. I felt myself so much comfortable during my stay over there. All the staff are nice and polite and hospitable in each and every way. I have visited so many hotels in my life visiting the mostly all places in India. But never been such kind of amenities and services what I found in hotel york.Indeed, I will definately recommand my relation and all my colleages to visit hotel york at least once in a life Girish parwar "
york hotel ,"Terrible Place I had the misfortune of staying in Hotel york a few days back.. by far my worst experience ever.The rooms do not have a fan.. not do they have individually controlled AC.. the AC was controlled centrally at the whims of the owners. Most of the times, it was turned off, as a result of which the room was very very stuffy. The night was really really bad tho.. thinking that the guest would have been asleep, the hotel turned off the AC at abt 11:00 P.M. and despite repeated complatints, refused to turn it on making excusses such as power cut in the entire area, local power cut, fault with the AC etc etc. Finally went to sleep at 2 after been fed up. the guys did not even have a table fan!!The rooms were pretty sad too.. matress was ok but the place was dingy.. too too little light.STay away form this place! "
york hotel ,"Superb restaurant The rest has a bit of catching up to do. Reception staff did not inspire confidence - don't land in late at night or you are fair game. Room staff friendly and attentive. Room itself ok for R300 - ask to see room, bring bag + haggle there. Make to leave if no joy at first. Agree price, leave bag + get written quote(I just paid cash) at reception as staff can change day on day and they feel honour bound to try it on. Check out central Delhi then eat in restaurant. Food and waiting staff exemplary. Central location best + worst bit, convenient to a lot but lively and noisy. It was much the same 20 years ago, apart from prices! "
york hotel ,"Hellhole Arrived late at night and accepted room in a bit of a hurry. Big mistake. Found a small lizard scurrying around the room, what looked like bedbugs in one of the beds, dust bunnies under the bed, battered walls in bathroom, dirt on many surfaces. Neighbor in next room was blasting TV at 1:00am and walls were quite thin.Gathered up my stuff, returned the key to reception and got the hell out, walked into the street at 1:00am and hailed a rickshaw for Clark International. "
york hotel ,"Cheaters and too dirty - Not recommended Arrived late and tired in this hotel. We read the review in the Lonely Planet and thought it would be a nice hotel.There where no rooms left (they said), but the Suite was free. Price: 6000 rs. We brought it down to 4000 incl. taxes. After we agreed, they asked us to pay 4000 rs + tax. We didn't agree anymore, because we agreed 4000 rs including tax.Then -out of nowhere - there was another free room. We where too tired and just took it. The price: 3250 rs excl. tax.They told us all the rooms where like this room. So we agreed with the price, but told them it was too high for the room. Soon we where regretting taking this room. It was dirty everywhere. The chairs, the bed, the toilet and the shower. Everything was really dirty. The shower was cold and there was a lot of noise at night from the personnel around the room.The next day we discovered that the other rooms where different and that they cheated on us to pay this amount of money. (We just walked into another room to check)We made a complaint, but there was no way of getting any discount or excuse. We where not allowed to speak with the manager (by phone). I saw his number on the telephone display and went across the street to call this man.He told us that we agreed with the room. In fact we did. But we did not asked for the noise from the personnel, the dirt in the room and the stained matresses, the COLD shower etc... Telling us that all the rooms where the same was a great lie.We paid the full amount and left.Have a look at the pictures... The cleanness of the rooms is on the same level as similar the service they offer you.(By the way: they offer breakfast, but you cannot have it in the York Resaurant downstairs, you have to eat it in your room (bon appetit :-( or in the LOBBY!) "
york hotel ,"Decent place by Delhi Standards Before I start this review, let me tell you something about myself. I was born and raised in India, allthough have spent the past 7 years in the US and travelled to many countries. So I am used to certain things while in India and have certain expectations in other countries - so my review may be a bit skewed (but not really). First of all, if you intend spending something below $150 for a room in Delhi - expect the worst. Delhi is expensive and every hotel is looking to cash in on tourists. To expect western standards for something below 150-200 bucks is almost impossible. If you go to a 5 star (or sometimes a 4-star), you will get what you expect. Any hotel that says it is 3-star is generally a sham as there is no clear demarcation on what is a 3-star or 2-star in Delhi (or for that matter in india).The reason, I chose York was for the location. - It was on the Outer Circle of Connaught Palace -- right in the heart of Delhi -- so there was always a lot of Hustle Bustle. Close to the railway station and almost central to everything that you would want to see. Pricing is a bit Expensive $87 (including tax), but most things were ok. The room was clean, the sheets, towels, blankets were clean. The mattress was worse than a $40 mattress. The room service was decent -- the waiters do not keep knocking on your door, asking if you need anything. They only come if you call and that too promptly. The hot water was good, pressure excellent, bathroom overall reasonably clean. The area is safe and plenty of restaurants around. Overall, I had no complaints. Just remember - most $50 motels in the US would have far better amenities. But this was Delhi -- and I had lowered my standards before I even started looking for a place. If you hunt well -- you can probably get a cheaper place with better amenities. I was a little lazy and this was only the 3rd motel i looked at.Just as a note of caution, do not book any hotel in Delhi before hand unless it is 4-star, 5-star and unless you are going during peak season and chances of finding a decent hotel room are bleak. Take a pre-paid cab from Delhi airport and keep hunting till you find a good place.Pay the cabbie a couple of 100 bucks (around $4-$5) and he will oblige. Look at the rooms before you decide on the hotel. The cabbie will generally take you to a place where he gets a commission for taking you there, so be careful.Overall, York worked well for me, since I had to stay for 2 nights. If you are going to stay just one night, just bight the bullet -- and go for a 5-star.Hotel Vikram is another good hotel (alltho more expensive) which was recommended to me by a couple of friends. The only reason, I did not choose it was because it was in South Delhi and travelling would have been a pain. "
york hotel ,"Disgusting! Dirty! Expensive! Rip-Off! Thiefs! On our way to Agra from Chandigarh, we where forced to spend a night in Delhi. As this was not planned for, we ended up having to search for a hotel at 11pm in the night. We where looking for Nirula's as that was highly rated by our &quot;Let's Go India&quot; guide, but that has closed down so the nearest was York Hotel.TRUST US, DO NOT GO THERE. It cost us Rs 3,700 (ZAR 650 / US$ 90), the first room we got was all musty and smelt damp. As we thought it was only for a few hours we thought we could survive the room. We tried the shower and it flooded the room. So they moved to another room that was dirty, no hot water and the bath tub had rings. Dirt rings. We decided to just suffer it out as we would be out in a few hours time. The next morning we didn't even take a shower as it was so disgusting. We just took our bags and headed for the train station.Disgusting! "
york hotel ,"Raised rates at checkout When I checked out, the hotel raised the rates by 50% over what we had agreed on when I checked in. So I got screwed and obviously will never return. "
york hotel ,"for budget stay only The hotel looks more like a motel than a hotel. Was expecting at least a 3 or 4 star hotel due to the price i paid (booked online) and the lonely planet put it as midrange. What a dissappointment.Overall it's okay and clean (although looks a bit run down) - friendly staff and an overally helpful tourdesk to wakes you up in the morning while you're having a peaceful sleep to ask ifyou would like a car for the day! The place is safe and located at the heart of budget shopping. Just 5 min down the road is Costa - thank goodness!Tips - bring your own toiletries!So if you're planning to stay there, remember to be modest in your expectation! "
york hotel ,"Basic We stayed here in January with our two children (15 and 11) for 6 nights as part of a round the world trip. It was my and our children's first trip to India (my wife had visited when she was young), and first experience of a developing country.The staff were friendly and helpful (tipping is mandatory), and the hotel is quite central (which was a key feature for us). The hotel was very basic though, and Connaught Place is generally fairly run down (except for inside many of the shops).The hotel is situated in K block, which is in the northern part of the circular Connaught Place. The nicer hotels in that general area tend to be on Janpath which runs south from Connaught place. There is a brand new metro station in the middle of Connaught Place.When we arrived at the hotel we found that our room only had one queen sized bed and one single bed (despite clearly setting out by email when booking that we required a room for 4 people - and being quoted a price on that basis), with not enough room to fit another bed. Rather than pay for two rooms (if we had known we may have to do that we would have chosen another hotel in the first place) we ended up having to sleep three people on the queen sized bed.The room did have a TV, hot water, a shower, and a toilet that worked, but apart from that it was pretty sparse, and was fairly dusty (as is most of Delhi). The hotel has room service, but the choice is very limited. The sheets were clean, but the blankets were very old and dirty (with Delhi dust and cigarette ash).The hotel has a man who organises tours/drivers, who was fairly helpful (although a bit on the pushy side). We booked a driver for a day trip of Delhi through him, which was okay but it would have been better to have a guide (or to do a guided tour) - we did a guided tour to Agra through Ashoka tours (a government agency situated in Connaught Place) - which was much more informative and enjoyable.The hotel was renovating its facade while we were there, as well as doing up the adjoining restaurant (which was closed). Even so, I don't think we would stay there again. On reflection it would have been better to pay more and stay in something a bit more upmarket in a nicer area (eg on Janpath) for our first experience of Delhi. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"worst hotel in delhi dont stay here ,even if they pay you,dirty ,smelly, noisy, dusty, insecure, uncomfortable.do not touch anything in this hotel as it will break,if not already damaged.plasma tv in lobby is only thing that works.worst bathrooms,wash hands after touching taps, beds dirty uncomfortable. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Reasonable hotel We spend few days at Yuvaraj Delux and stay was pleasant though the hotel is located in a not so good place. The roads are narrow and congested.The hotel management and staff were well mannered. It was worth for Rs.1100 per night. Donot expect the kind of facilities and ambience that you would expect in a Budget or long stay hotels in US in any Budget hotel in India. The travel desk people were good, but I learned that their role in arranging trips are limited to collecting their cut on the trip cost and they have no role for rest of the trip. I booked 2 trips with them, one for a city tour and another one to Agra and was not satisfied with either.Single day City Tour: The places they include as part of the tour cannot be completed in a days time at all. An advise for anyone visiting Delhi is to travel by Delhi Metro and get down at nearest tourist point. Delhi Metro is a stones throw from Yuvaraj Delux ( at Ajmeri Gate) and for that matter from any hotel in Paharganj or Arakashan Road . Metro does not have a reach to all of Delhi but can take one to the nearest point and from there other conveyance say a taxi or auto can be availed. I think metro is operational from 6 AM to 11 PM. Metro takes you to places within Delhi cheaper and faster and it is clean and well maintained. The max ticket in metro from one end of city to other comes to around Rs.20. There are tourist passes in metro which comes at one day pass for Rs 70 and 3 days pass for Rs 200. With these passes one can make infinite travels for one day or 3 days in metro. These passes are meant solely for tourists.Single Day Agra Tour: This was horrible. They charged Rs 450 per head. Never ever avail of this tour to Agra. 12 hours will be consumed commuting itself. The bus operators donot know how to operate tours. For lunch/dinner/break fast they stop at the worst restaurant (where the bus staff gets the best cut) . You start at 6 AM from Delhi and reach Agra by 12 noon and will be taken to Red Fort and will get hardly 1/2 hour there. Then they take you to some Handicraft emporium which is a waste of time.(If you buy something from the emporium the bus guys get the commission). Then you are driven to TajMahal . TajMahal is too crowded (during Dec-Feb) and it takes around 2 hours in the queue to get into the Taj. Avoid a trip to Taj during Dec- Feb if possible. You get hardly 1 hour in Taj and by then its time to start off to Delhi. The bus will next take you to Mathura and Vrindavan which are holy places of birth of Krishna and then to Delhi. By the time you reach Delhi its around 2 AM next day. Its a tiring trip where you spend hardly 2 hours seeing places and is NOT AT ALL WORTH IT. A better option is to book a Hotel in Agra, take a train to Agra from Delhi,(New Delhi railway station is walkable distance from Paharganj/Arakashan road) stay for a couple of days in Agra, see Red Fort and Taj. Never take the one day trip option provided by travel desk of any hotel in Delhi. Its a waste of money and time and is tiring. All in all I would recommend Yuvaraj Delux to anyone looking for a budget accomodation in New Delhi. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"what a mess! I arrived at midnight. The staff are not so welcoming. After waiting at reception for 10 mins with my backpack, the bellboy asked for it only when I was given the key for my room! And I did not hear a thank you for the tip.. All the staff tried hard to sell me some drinks even tough my refusal many times.There are no pillow covers. The bed sheet was so dirty. There was no towel or soap in the bathroom. It is very basic. This hotel is the worst I stayed in India! "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,Nice Service! Thank you for your hospitality and support. I feel very comfortable all staff were very friendly. 
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Awful place! We stayed in the Yuvraj for four nights. There was nothing &quot;Deluxe&quot; about it: the room and bathroom were dirty. the bed was dirty, the staff was rude and it got even worse when we refused to book a tour. We noticed that they went in our room while we were gone - at least they didn't touch anything of our stuff. But they did't take they rubbish out or changed linen either. It was also awful loud: from morning till 11 at night they were repairing stuff around the house and there was a phone rining in the hall even at night.The shower was not working and warm water was not available.The pictures we saw in the Internet were totally misleading. It din't look like this at all but all shabby and dirty.I would recommend staying somewhere at Connought Place. It does not take long to get to New Delhi Railway Station from there and it is so much nicer there. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Total misrepresentation and disgusting Firstly my booking was supposed to include a free airport pick-up but the hotel owner insisted I paid 400RPs. I booked a room for 3 adults - my son, myself and my husband so naturally expected a double and a single bed or 3 singles but there was only one double bed. When we asked what had happened to the bed the porter arrived with a damp mouldy stained mattress and plonked it on the floor at the end of the bed - needless to say my son refused and sat up all night. I also sat up all night as i couldn't bring myself to sleep in the dirty bedding. The outside of the hotel doesn't look too bad but the rest is like rising damp. The room was disgusting and bore no resemblance to the photos on the internet, infact I do not believe it's the same interior. It was grimy, curtains hanging off the rail, paint peeling off the walls and a filthy antiquated bathroom with no hot water. I would love to know where the recommendation by Loney Planet came from and love the bit about &quot;deluxe hotel at budget prices&quot;! If I had stayed here at the beginning of our travels it would have put me off India for life. This was a very bad end to an otherwise lovely holiday. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Really bad hotel in a bad part of town Looking at some of the previous reviews, I do not see how anybody could use the word &quot;excellent&quot; to describe any aspect of this hotel. It was among the worst places I have ever stayed. The difference between the internet description and pictures of this hotel vs. reality is like night and day. The bedsheet (yes, that's bedsheet, singular, because there is no top sheet) looked dirty and the towel was worn and dirty looking. The hot water in my bathroom did not work. A room with a western toilet was not available. It was an extemely noisy area with constant horns honking. I did not find the staff friendly or helpful. My advice to anybody staying in New Delhi is to splurge and go for one of the better hotels (even if it means breaking your budget) because the low-end hotels are worse than you can imagine. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Do not stay here!! This hotel is dirty and noisy, the staff are rude and the in house 'travel agency' will not leave you alone until you have bought one of their tours.While we were glad for our car and driver who we booked there we did spend the rest of the holiday feeling completely ripped-off, as did just about every other tourist we met.Do yourself a favour and do not stay in this hotel or anywhere in this area, instead I would recommend that you book a homestay.I have a strong suspicion that the glowing reports on this site were written by the hotel, or customers forced into it - as we were when told to write a recommendation for our driver! "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"What do you expect for $15 This is basically a budget hotel and it would seem that budget in India costs more than anywhere else! As with most of the hotels in this area they have spent all of their money on making the reception look nice and have forgotten to renovate the rooms. Our room was dark but pleasantly quiet, the carpet was old and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in about 50 years. Oh and the bed was hard! At first we were highly annoyed but when you consider that all the hotels in this pricerange/area are the same we probably got a reasonable deal in terms of how quiet our room was. The reception staff seem to leave you alone but the &quot;in house travel agency&quot; was very pushy. We did not use them. Internet good value at 20 INR per hour. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"Don't believe the two previous reviews! We booked into the hotel after reading the two very positive reviews on the Trip Advisor site. Not only were the rooms dirty, run down and loud but then the staff was loathe to let us check out the next morning - we managed it after one hour. The harrassment in this hotel was definitely on a level with some of the worst we encountered on our India trip. "
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,Value For Money Hotel Yuvraj Deluxe is an excellent hotel. The staff was friendly and helpfull. Connaught Place and Janpath are 15 min. walk away. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel 
yuvraj deluxe hotel ,"best value for money along with best friends I had a very pleasent and enjoyable trip to india recently. I not only enjoyed the indian food ,also liked the city of Delhi very much. I had a very wonderful experience at the hotel Yuvraj Deluxe where i stayed. "
