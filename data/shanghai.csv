88 xintiandi executive residence ,"LOVELOVELOVE THIS HOTEL!!! Have stayed at 88 Xiantiandi three times now and it is always a treat. Huge rooms you hardly want to leave. Curtained bedroom area. Fabulous bed, great pillows, spacious and stylish lounge/suite area, fully equipped for the business traveler, great lighting and electronics. Delicious breakfast buffet. Now, if only the hotel could make sure it woudn't rain when I come to town. It is also a 5 minute walk to Green Massage and YPlus Yoga, which are both fantastic and make for a perfect day. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Fantastic Hotel but comes with a premium I stayed at Xintiandi last December to watch the new years celebration. This hotel is pretty fantastic, the rooms are spacious and well maintained. The rooms with the view of the lake were a great place to watch the fireworks from. The hotel was impeccably clean with contemprorary furnishings and the hotel staff is extremely helpful. The location is also ideal, since it is right next to a main shopping area. While the hotel was a little more expensive, it was worth it for the view. This hotel also has executive residences for the frequent business traveller. I can’t imagine a much better place to stay if I were travelling for work. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Best area in Shanghai We spent five days in Shanghai and went all over the city. We felt very lucky to come back to the 88Xintiandi at the end of each day. This is the best area and neighborhood. Very convenient to everything. We walked to the Yuyuan Gardens, the Peoples Park and the French Concession. The two blocks around the hotel are filled with great cafes and restaurants, including a wonderful bakery. Unlike large, busy hotels this hotel is a quiet, peaceful place. Our room had a large living area with a separate kitchen and bed area. The best part of the room were the large windows and glass door that opened out to a balcony overlooking a beautiful park and lake with the city skyline in the distance. What a great view! It was so interesting watching all of the park activities with people coming and going. The room was very clean and comfortable with free internet, a music system, leg&amp;foot massager, a bowl of fruit (that is filled each day), comfortable bed with all the different pillows you want, and free water bottles. Also included is a great breakfast buffet with Chinese dishes and Dim sum that was delicious. They also had typical American breakfast foods (cereal, fruit, eggs cooked anyway you want) and European foods (meat &amp; cheese and other salads, with the best homemade bread and jam.) We did use the pool and fitness center and were the only ones there. The workers were very nice and helpful and most spoke English. They had no problem getting us a taxi whenever we needed one. We would definitely stay at the 88Xintiandi again. If you want a great experience in Shanghai you should stay here! "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"great location great service Have stayed at 88 Xintiandi three times in past year and overall had a good experience. The rooms are great with cool design and furnishings. For a boutique hotel, it is a very good place for business travelers as the desk accessories and fax / phone communication system are first rate. Breakfast is pretty basic in terms of selection of items but the dinning area is nice and they do a happy hour type thing in the late afternoon. Some reviewers say the hotel needs more of a restaurant and a bar. i disagree. There are more than 40 bars and restaurants in the Xintiandi complex alone.....all you have to do is walk 20 -25 meters and you are there! Plus concierge is quite helpful.Only drawback to the hotel is that many taxi drivers don't know the exact hotel location. You can get a card with the name of the hotel in Chinese characters or you can just say &quot;Xintiandi&quot; and they'll drop you off near Starbucks ( about 3 minute walk from hotel).This is a very nice hotel in a fun part of town. Definitely worth a try. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Upscale Alternative This hotel property in the much acclaimed Xintiandi area of Shanghai is owned and operated by the very developer that developed Xintiandi Shanghai. As a very high quality hotel product this &quot;boutique&quot; property is so extrodinarily located it forgets a few of the fundamental needs of a high daily rate hotel such as a bar and full service restaurant. Kind of a shame. The room experience however is magnificent as long as you are not facing the Xintiandi &quot;mall&quot;. Ask for a room facing the road so that you won't hear the pounding of the late night disco all night across the mall. The rooms are designed beautifully with a raised bed area enclosed with sheer drapery making for a true zenful experience. Music is provided in the room as well which does take one away from the hussle of the Shanghai street scene. The desk area is huge and very accommodating for working all day if necessary. Anyone would want an office away from home like this.The staff is very courteous and multi-lingual. One of the nights I was there I was invited by the management team to join them in the 3rd Floor meeting/concierge suite to partake of a bit of happy hour. Wonderful management staff along with local patrons of the hotel were on hand to share some complimentary wine and hors d'ouevres. A very nice evening before a dinner out.All-in-all, this hotel is a very charming, restful and elegant property that well suits the location and a discerning guest. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"An Oasis of Calm and Elegance in bustling Shanghai This 50 room, 7 storey boutique hotel is an Oasis of calm and elegance amongst Shanghai’s bustling skyscraper blocks.Strategically placed on the edge of the fashionable Xintiandi shopping and restaurant precinct and across the road from a beautiful park and lake.My wife and I walked comfortably from the hotel to view the impressive collection of artefacts in the Shanghai museum. On another occasion we strolled from the hotel through the beautiful Fuxing park (laid out by the French in days past), into the old French Concession area. Here we viewed the homes of Chou En Lai and Sun Yat Sen, the founder of modern China.Our room at 88 Xintiandi was extremely spacious and very tastefully decorated, in a modern style but using many traditional Chinese elements. Free Internet cable connection in the room, plus free Wifi in the hotel enabled us to keep up to date with e-mails – even when eating breakfast, overlooking the park. The hotel personnel, led by resident manager Jocelyn Yu, were all most attentive and helped us with all our varied requests concerning, places of interest, shopping, tailoring, Mandarin tips and “where to buy muffins”. (A plate of freshly-baked assorted muffins magically appeared in our room a few hours later!).88 Xintiandi will definitely be our home again when we are next in Shanghai. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,great hotel fantastic hotel - rooms are awesome - ask for lake facing room though as back side gets noisy from niteclubs.breakie is basic perfect location thoughalways stay there when i'm in town 
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Great modern boutique hotel This is a really nice place to stay in Shanghai.Small enough to feel special but big enough to handle all of your needs. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are larger than average, modern with plasma tv, free Wifi, foot massager and juicer (yes, fruit included) but the rooms still have a warm feeling to them. The elevated beds are really comfortable and the colored lights are a fun touch. You are not near the Bund or old Shanghai but they are just a 10 min cab ride away. You are in an upscale shopping area with some unique shops. nice walking. You won't go wrong booking a room here. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"It was just OK Maybe I had higher expections than I should have.I had arranged for hotel airport transportation in advance. Perhaps it was an omen, but the driver didn't show up. I called the hotel, racking up more $$ on my cell phone, and finally, the driver hurries over and says he was waiting for us at another gate. He could have smoothed things over if he had apologized, but instead went on and on about how he waited at the international gate. I explained to him that it was his error, cause we came from Beijing (domestic gate) , not San Francisco. I had submitted all the airline info to the hotel in advance. Whatever! I was aggravated.Then when I checked in, I was told I had only 1 room. I had originally asked for one 2 bedroom suite, but they e-mailed me to change it to two standard rooms. So when I questioned it at check-in, and was told indeed was only for 1 room, I assumed the hotel changed it back to the 2 bedroom suite. Of course, when we got to the room, it was just a standard room and clearly couldn't accomodate all 6 of us. I had to call front desk, to clear things up. They did quickly sent up another key for the 2nd room. I have no complaints about the amenities. The rooms were nice enough, the location was great if you like trendy ex-pat friendly restaurants. The staff was friendly. The breakfast though had lots of choices, were not the best quality.More problems occured after the first night when my room had no hot water. We had to use another room to take a shower. Then, when we returned to the hotel in the same afternoon, my brother's room had no water at all! So, they had to move him to another room. When I went to the front desk to complain, they assured me that the replacement room was larger. It wasn't. My brother then had to move to yet another room.The staff was very apologetic, but water problems in 2 separate rooms were simply not acceptable for how expensive the rooms were. I'm starting to think I should stick to American chain hotels instead of these independent boutique places.To the hotel's credit, the manager did call me personally and offered free airport transportation to the airport for our return trip, and sent over some fruit and gifts. It was nice of her, but I would have rather have a problem free stay than freebies.Had we not had any problems, I would have been a very happy camper. I wonder if my experience is that out of the ordinary though having water problems in 2 separate rooms would indicate otherwise. Would I stay there again? Probably not. I think I'll try another hotel. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Exceeds all expectations 88 Xintiandi is a truly wonderful boutique hotel. It excels in all aspects: service, design, room size, and location. More over there is a &quot;generosity of spirit&quot;, nothing feels mean nor cost saving. The staff are lovely and very helpful. Everything we asked for was provided in a relaxed and no fuss manner.For breakfast one can sit out on the terrace and look over the old roofs of Shanghai. They could improve the coffee as machine espresso, but then I have never stayed in a hotel in China that did wonderful coffee? Our room was huge and very nice too with wee balconies. Beautiful flower arrangements adorn the hallways that are decorated extremely tastefully with Chinese antique furniture.Also free and working internet. Fabulous. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Good value good location good surroundings Well-situated in the Xintiandi district and designed with both taste and functionality, 88 XTD is a nice place to stay. I think it beats the average for its price point in China, not in the least because everything works properly. For a short vacation stay, my traveling companion and I agreed that it was entirely suitable.For longer stays, the sink and microwave looked handy but no substitute for a proper service apartment. I also think that the Xintiandi location is a stronger positive for tourists than for business people. But for China, the functional and decorative aspects of the room made a tremendous difference in our comfort level. The breakfast room and balcony were quite enjoyable amid a spell of nice weather, and the buffet breakfast was in line with the generally (surprisingly?) high standard of joint-venture/foreign hotel breakfast spreads in China.Several of the staff were pleasant in their greetings and even helpful. But compared with some of China's best hotels, the level of professionalism was not quite there. Nobody looked like they were ready to jump in and be helpful without prompting. Ten years ago, that might have qualified for special recognition given the dismal standard of service that prevailed. Today, a little more effort would make the difference between a decent enough place to stay and one to keep coming back to.We're glad we stayed there. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Awesome location Great location in a very pretty part of Shanghai, with excellent shopping and restaurants/bars. The staff were very helpful, and spoke good english. No external noise due to quadruple-glazed doors/windows overlooking the plaza, however internal noise from rooms next door and hallways (why do people bring noisy children to stay in hotels like this and ruin the experience for others???). The room was lovely, and the huge king sized bed was very comfortable. Extras like a proper coffee maker and juicer were appreciated. Only strange thing was no milk for the coffee/tea was available, either in the room or when requested from reception (yet was available for breakfast).So unless you are stuck in a room next door to inconsiderate parents and their offspring, you will find this hotel to be a lovely place to stay. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Boutique alternative to 5* Tourist Traps - Loved it. 5* facilities, rooms with kitchens, lounges and no crowds. In the lovely French quarter, not more than 15 minutes walk or taxi from anything you want to see. We spent 5 days here and happily spent 2 in the room reading and relaxing. If you don't want a western chain hotel near the tourist traps with 1000 rooms, stay here. The breakfast and executive club are more than adequate but not quite at 5* level on variety. Cannot fault the quality and cleanliness and service. We had a &quot;lakeview&quot; room and suspect the rooms overlooking the shopping centre are less attractive (and less costly). Bed a bit small when you expect a king size but quite comfortable. Great amenities. If I had to come back to Shanghai for business (probably the only reason I'd go back) I'd stay here. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"my new home in shanghai I just spent the weekend (or one night) at 88 Xintiandi and I am happy to report I have found my new home in Shanghai. The strange thing is that I decided to stay here almost by accident. I am in China for the entire month of December staying at a town that is a two hour drive from Shanghai. When I flew in last weekend I stayed at the Four Seasons thinking that after a 16-hour trip I’d want only “the best.” For my second stay in Shanghai I wanted to save a little bit of money and was originally going to book a night at the Okura Garden Hotel b/c I had heard that the French Concession is the happening place to stay in Shanghai. At 1430 RMB a night – a rate I found on the LHW site -- the Okura was considerably cheaper than the Four Seasons. However, the reviews on Tripadviser for the Okura mentioned that the rooms were not exactly of the highest standard and a quick look at the Okura website confirmed my suspicions. In the photos, the rooms looked pretty basic. I decided to take a look at the CN Traveller site to look for other recommendations. First on the list was 88 Xintiandi. I clicked over to the website and found a quoted rate of USD 283, which is roughly what the B&amp;B rate at the four seasons comes out to. Still, I thought I’d check their online reservations system for availability. To my surprise, I found a weekend rate of USD 210++ which, while not as cheap as the Okura, was definitely a savings from the four seasons. I figured I’d give it a go.I can happily say that I’m thrilled that I did.I should mention that I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with “Boutique Hotels” – I usually find them hit-or-miss. I often find that they do not have enough staff, lack proper – often basic – facilities, and are not a good value for the money. When I first walked into the lobby of 88 Xintiandi, my heart sank. It was small and looked a looked like it could use a fresh coat of paint on the walls and a refinishing for the parquet floors. I figured I’d been dooped again. Oh well.When I made it up to my room on the 3rd floor, however, all was very quickly forgiven and forgotten: Very, very nice indeed! This room is HUGE. With a Huge king size bed, king size desk, 42 inch plasma and DVD surround sound, and did I mention the huge king size bed? And comfortable too! Maybe not four seasons mattress caliber, but trust me, it’s more than sufficient. WOW. All for the bargain price of USD 210++ -- Fantastic! I don’t know why the poster below mentions that the room felt cramped. To me it didn’t feel cramped at all, but I was alone and s/he mentions staying with 2 friends so I wonder if that has anything to do with it. Perhaps if you add a roll away bed, it takes up a but of the living area. Still, this is one of those hotel rooms that I wish I had more time to just sit and hang out in. it’s a totally livable space. I cant tell you how many hotel rooms, large and small, often leave you with a feeling that they are only good as a place to crash and store your belongings while you are out and about. The rooms at Xintiandi are the total opposite of this – and I was staying in the lowest category room. I can’t even imagine how big and livable the true suites are.The room’s decor was done in what I’ve heard is Japanese style – lot’s of wood paneling, circular pillows and a curtain that separates the sleeping area from the living area. There is a kitchenette stocked with a microwave a blender (with suggested mixed drinks and smoothie recipe, and a few bottles of Xintiandi branded wines. Again, full marks for presentation! I don’t want to mislead anyone in to thinking that these rooms are anything more than they really are. To my fairly untrained eye, my room seemed to be roughly 550 sq ft which I think is pretty large by hotel room standards. I don’t have the technical specs of the room, so I cannot say for sure. When I say the rooms are huge, I don’t mean that they are presidential suites. But they do fit a king size bed and still have room for separate sleeping and living areas. So that should give you an idea of the size.Meanwhile, even the lower category rooms have balconies facing the Xintiandi courtyard. I guess this is considered undesirable b/c of the noise at night, but in terms of the view, I thought it was great.More importantly, you really could not have chosen a better location. I’d say 70% of the restaurants and bars that are on most shanghai guides happen to be part of the Xintiandi complex. I would say that if someone really wanted to, they could spend a weekend in Shanghai and not even leave Xintiandi. (not that I recommend this, I’m just saying its totally possible.) The hotel is a 15 minute taxi ride to the Bund and other centrally located attractions, and in general a great base of operations from which to explore shanghai. I would echo the warnings of other Tripadvisor members regarding the noise at night. Xintiandi is a shopping destination by day and a bar and club destination by night. I was aware of the noise factor due to the other reviews on this site but had intended on staying out late myself on Saturday evening and thereby missing the noise. In the end, however, I spent the entire day running around shanghai sightseeing and I was so tired when I got to my room and didn’t have a chance to really rest. At around midnight I decided rather than head down to the bars below I’d might as well just try to get some rest, even though I thought given the noise it might be a problem. Thankfully, I was so tired I simply conked out and work up rested and ready the next morning. I’m not what you call a “light sleeper” but I definitely have trouble sleeping when there is noise all around, so keep that in mind before you book. Or maybe pay a little extra and that will get you a city view room which may be a little quieter as it doesn’t face the courtyard. I was on the lower floor but whatever –in the end it didn’t bother me one bit. Hopefully on my next stay I will make it to one of the bars.The included breakfast was acceptable – pretty much the standard buffet-breakfast you get at most hotels. It was included in the price of the room which was nice. On the website there are pictures of this out door lounge-like area which happens to be a large balcony outside the breakfast room. The weather is of course too cold to stay outside right now so it was not in use, but I imagine in the spring and summer time this would be a great place to have a cocktail. I also spent an hour at the fitness centre that is across the courtyard in the Alexander City mall – it was very nice, although I did think the 100 RMB charge was a bit excessive for my one hour workout. I was also very, very happy with the service. Again, not zillions of staff members busing about but more than enough to accommodate guests’ needs – and did I mention the affordable laundry service (which I unfortunately didn’t have enough time to take advantage of.)I guess my only complaint – and it is a minor one – is that the common areas look a little worn. The hallways have wall to wall carpeting that looks like its been tred on a bit too much and the lobby could use some sprucing up, but this is a minor – and actually pretty negligible. I only mention it because it was part of my fist impression of the hotel and it was a negative one.All in all, I hope to / intend to return to 88 Xintiandi. I can not think of a better hotel value for the price and I doubt that there is another hotel in Shanghai that can match it for value. This hotel exceeded my expectations in every way and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in Shanghai. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"convenient location stayed here for one night after wanting to stay here before (but it's above our corporate &quot;city cap&quot; rate) had 2 friends in town from Miami and we all loved the location, the rooms feel a little cramped but in terms of location &amp; etc, you cannot beat this place in terms of conveniencethis also is a cute boutique hotel and has a bit more soul then the typical hotel chains, all rooms have their own little kitchen in case you don't want to eat at the restaurants right outside (there are tons of choices), definitely worth trying "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"My two cents... I only have two things to add to the previous reviews:1. I've been a frequent guest at 88 Xintiandi for the past three years and can say that the great service mentioned in the other reviews is very consistent. In fact, the service gets better over time as the hotel staff gets to know you. If you're thinking about staying there again, go for it. Don't bother with the other &quot;luxe&quot; properties in Shanghai.2. There is a terrific Chinese restaurant called Villa du Lac that is just up the street. Go left out of the hotel entrance on Huang Pi Nan Lu--toward Huaihai Central Road. It is across the street at the corner of the park entrance in one of the old concession buildings. Just ask the front desk staff at 88 Xintiandi--and make reservations.Villa du Lac serves the old Imperial Court cuisine--Huaiyang. There are a handful of this style restaurant in Shanghai, but they aren't nearly as good. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"First Class Excellent Location This is excellent hotel. Number one: it is in the best section of Shanghai, in tourist section on walking mall with blend of Chinese and western style restaurants, pubs, and clubs. Famous shopping nearby, 4 blocks off, and Nanjing Road can be walked to in about 16 minutes. Hotel is modern and elegantly styled, detailed woodwork, detailed trickets in room, mini kitchenette, high speed internet, impeccably clean, bathroom very nice. It is a small boutique style hotel, not a monster chain hotel. The only draw back is noise through windows at night as this is tourist walking area, personally I slept very good, but I can see if you were trying to go to sleep at 9:00 pm there may be background noise [you could always put on cd, they provide many cd's in room]. I have now staye twice, and am booking again for October trip. Very nice breakfast buffet included. Highly reccomend, especially due to location, I have stayed at very nice hotels in Pudong area, but isolated, you need to take 20 minute taxi into City, here you just walk out your door. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Very highly recommeded Decided to stay at 88 Xintiandi after months of research and deliberation. Our first visit to Shanghai, part business part pleasure, and wanted a hotel that was well located but with character, atmosphere and a sense that you were in shaghai; afterall, who wants to stay in a nameless &quot;cookie cutter'&quot; designed chain hotel that feels like it could anywhere? This place absolutely lived up to expectations and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for personal service, and a sense of intimacy. The staff were incredibly professional and went out of their way to assist with our needs. Our two rooms overlooking the park were fantastic: huge size, with kitchen, dining and lounge areas, decorated with a combination of chinese antiques, carved screens and '60s modernist funriture that gave you a sense that you could only be in china; we loved the antithesis to the glitz, formality and pretentiousness of the usual business hotel suspects eg Shangrila, Four Seasons, Westin etc. Whist the rooms at the back foverlooking the lively redeveloped Xintiandi precint may be noisy, ours were completely quite.You can't do better in terms of a central location. Xintiandi may be newly developed, but the character has been beutifully retiained, providing countless top-notch restuarants, bars and shops; Shanghai can be intimidating for fisrt time visitors and the area provides a welcome respite. Since everything in Shanghai is so spread out, walking around is not usually an option. Taxis being so cheap and pletiful I feel it is more important to choose a locating with an interseting immediate environment, rather than its relative position in the city: I would never stay, say, Pudong (sterile), The Bund (stunning buildings but traffic like highway) or Renmin Square (massive and bleak). If elegant, chic and authentic sophistication is what you are after, another gorgeous option is the Ruijin guesthouse, set in quiet lush gardens within the French Concession. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Trendy but Noisy Agree with the other reviewers that the hotel is fun &amp; trendy and you can't beat the location, BUT after three stays there I'm not going back because I can't take any more nights of noise until 1 AM. The hotel is right above the bar district of Xintiandi and no matter how hard you try to shut the street noises out, you can't. The music plays until 1 AM, revelers are sometimes still on the street even later. If you're out yourself, hey, no sweat! But if you're in town for meetings or work, you need your sleep and this isn't the hotel to stay in. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Watch out Ian Shraeger! I was looking for a cool hotel along the lines of the W Hotel's &amp; came across this. The pictures do it no justice - the taste level is terrific! Very interesting mix of contemporary meets China deco. Whomever designed the interiors of this hotel has it going on big time. Being in the appareal business I was inspired by the lobby to design a new tradeshow booth based on the astetics of this hotel, that's how tastefull it is - a welcome reprieve from the same old big commercial hotels or trendy wanna be a Shraeger hotel. The rooms are very spacious, soothing, very accomodating for business people or toursits alike &amp; a tremndous value for the price. Wish Hong Kong had a hotel like this. The breakfast buffet is just average but who cares, the place is great! "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Impeccable Ask for a room facing the park, so it's not noisy when the clubs down below go full throttle... Then, you're in for a real treat: all kinds of restaurants (T8 and Villa Deluc are pricey, but not-to-be-missed), bars, coffee bars, boutiques, etc., right below at Xintiandi. Service here is amazing. If you're looking for a comfortable and plush hotel, unlike any of the chains, this is the place you ought to book. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"An absolute Gem 88 Xintiandi is an absolute gem! Rooms are enormous, staff is wonderful &amp; service couldn't be better. On previous visit to Shanghai we had stayed at (and enjoyed) the Portman Ritz Carlton -- but 88 Xintiandi is our new Shanghai home! Location is excellent. You can walk out the door and be moments from good shopping, great restaurants and a fabulous massage at the Green Door Spa (for a whopping $12!). We had the 2 bedroom suite which was fabulous. 2 big bedrooms. One with attached bath. A 2nd full bath was located near living room. Big living room area with dining &amp; kitchenette. Small balcony overlooking the park.We were not bothered by any street noise, but had requested rooms on higher floors with park view. A fellow traveler had one of the deluxe rooms/park view. It too was huge with living/dining/kitchenette.Service was excellent for everything from meeting us at airport, bringing a laptop to the room &amp; hooking us up to internet to recommending spas/restaurants/shops &amp; good car/driver for hire to take us around. Ask for Iverson - he's a delight! "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Nice Boutique Located in the heart of the Xintiandi entertainment complex in/close to the former French Concession. This is both good &amp; bad - if you want to hang out in western style restos &amp; bars (&amp; pay western prices too), very easy to do here. But the noise from the bars is noticeable from the hotel's rooms (tho not overly intrusive from the 5th floor at least). The 56 room boutique hotel is good, above average good - the rooms are large mini-suites with great balconies. You must pay Y100 to visit the adjacent Alexander City gym (which is dead!). Breakfast buffet was adequate ... it didn't blow me away like the Peninsula Beijing's buffet. Staff were friendly tho the front desk / reception seemed to need 3 ppl to check me in &amp; out. Conclusion: If you need or want to be in this area, then definitely a good choice. If location is irrelevant, JW Marriott or Ritz are outstanding alternatives. "
88 xintiandi executive residence ,"Pricey but location location location.... As frequent visitors to Shanghai, we have stayed at the Shangri-La, Renaissance Pudong, Grand Hyatt, and Four Seasons - but this place is my favorite so far. The location is great with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. We have a great balcony facing the pedestrian street overlooking outdoor cafes and boutique shops. The staff are friendly and helpful - and all rooms come with a small kitchenette. The only downside is the price.... this place is overpriced for what it's worth, but I don't think that'll stop me from wanting to stay here again. "
an ting villa hotel shanghai ,"Beautiful Setting Quiet Convenient Location.... Nice. When our driver [the owner of the company we were here to visit] pulled in the front gate, he asked us to please wait in the car so he could make sure we were in the right place... I picked out the hotel several weeks before, so I knew what to expect, but, the place was a surprise to my local escort... Turns out that he had a hard time believing that such a beautiful place was actually a hotel.! The location is easy to reach by car or Metro line 1, just off HengShan Road about 200 yards from the HengShan Road Metro station. If you're not familiar, this area of Shanghai is what I would call &quot;inner city residential&quot;. Mostly residences [lots of ex-pats] with many local restaurants and bars... Four Metro stops [about 10 minutes, cost RMB 3 each way] from city-center [People's Square/Nanjing Rd].I picked this hotel from recommendations here and I'd say the previous reviewers were spot-on... The hotel grounds are beautiful, the hotel is older, but well-maintained. Overall, it's a very nice place and for a very reasonable [for inner city Shanghai] price.The rooms are a good size and 4-star quality [see photos]. Furnishings are a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The bathrooms are 4.5-star with updated granite and all the usual amenities. The bed was firm, but, not as hard as others I've slept on in China. The pillows were plentiful, large and just right. In-room safe, decent TV, free internet and small mini-bar complete the picture. There is a balcony that is shared between two rooms, so, the balconies were all locked for security. You could not go out on the balcony at all.. A small disappointment, but, I was glad the hotel was safety-conscious. There was a small breakfast buffet with most of the usual Chinese and Western breakfast foods... It was ok... not great, not bad... Coffee was pretty good...I suppose my only small complaints were... 1.The front desk staff was a bit dour. No smiles at all, but, very efficient service... and.. 2. The electrical outlets were a bit old/loose.. You had to jiggle wires a bit to get things like laptop and phone chargers to stay powered... Minor inconveniences... I would definitely stay here again. "
an ting villa hotel shanghai ,"Peaceful and comfortable four star hotel The Anting Villa is a very good hotel, set amid well kept gardens on a quiet road in a leafy suburb of Shanghai. My room was comfortable, modern, and very well equipped; a comfortable bed, easy chair and footstool, and a bathroom with full bath and plenty of space for toiletries. The room not only had a sizeable desk, but also came with unlimited high speed internet access included in the room price. My room even came with a computer which I assume worked with the large flat screen television (I used my own laptop, so I’m not sure exactly how the computer worked.)My impression is that this is a hotel primarily for business people rather than tourists. It is in the Xuhui Zone of Shangha, an area which as far as I could tell contains little that would be of interest to most leisure travelers. The hotel is a 20 minute taxi ride (costing 25 yuan, or about US$3) from the Bund area, and it is a short walk away from an underground train station. The hotel does not have a tour desk. It has three restaurants, serving Chinese and foreign food, and all three them are perfectly adequate though unspectacular. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and competent; not all spoke English, but those who didn’t were quick to find someone who could help this foreigner who speaks no Chinese.All in all, this is a very good, peaceful, and modern hotel, with a competent and attentive staff. I enjoyed my three day stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to come back. But if you are looking for a hotel with easy access to tourist attractions, in room massages, karaoke, or plentiful tourist information, this probably isn’t the place for you. "
ascott pudong ,"Beautiful Place I stayed at Ascott for nearly 2 months! That is a long time to actually know the hotel staff by name - and trust me, the staff was genuinely very nice. I was undergoing training in Pudong and Ascott is one of the best places you can stay. With a nice view overlooking the river, Ascott offers all the luxuries that one can expect only from 4/5 start. One gets a good variety in food, though not so much for a vegetarian. Pool and Gym facilities are excellent. "
ascott pudong ,"Spacious clean and good value for Shanghai Myself and some colleagues stayed at the Ascott for a week to attend a conference, having chosen the Ascott as being within reasonable walking distance of the (very expensive) hotels where the conference was taking place. The Ascott's accommodation is more geared to the long-stay traveller, but we were more than happy with the huge apartment-style accommodation. The one-bedroom suite was very spacious, with a bedroom, living/dining room with office space, separate galley kitchen, large bathroom and even a dressing room. It was also spotlessly clean, the maid came in every day and each day left two bottles of mineral water. There was a good array of complimentary toiletries and a large number of complimentary sachets of tea, coffee, green tea, creamer etc. Its easy to buy milk and other drinks from the small shop round the corner, as there was no mini bar. The only downside as far as I was concerned was that since the hotel caters more for long-stay guests, there are not really the facilities for refreshments that one would find in a regular hotel. There was no bar/cafe on site, only a room where the complimentary breakfast was taken, but this shut after breakfast time. As to the breakfast, this is best avoided as it is very poor. Go somewhere else for a better breakfast. Given that the Ascott itself is immaculate and very clean, I was surprised to find that the tables on which the breakfast was laid out were very unsavoury looking and seemed unclean, especially around the tea/coffee are. There was a lot of Chinese food available, but very little in the way of a Western breakfast, some sliced bread next to a very dirty toaster, some small dry rolls, and some jam and butter and yoghurt but that was about it. There were bacon and beans and some small omlettes but the bacon did not look right and most of the food was very unappetising. There were numerous staff at every breakfast, but their time might have been better spent cleaning the breakfast area rather than just hovering, chatting and getting in the way of the guests. Reception staff were quite helpful and organised a nice car from and to the airport at a cost of RMB 600 one way. The Pudong international airport is about 45 mins drive, locally one can take taxis at a very reasonable cost - the hotel will get one quite promptly -but bear in mind Chinese taxi drivers mostly do not speak English and also the Ascott is tucked away down a side road, so best show them the address of the hotel in Chinese and tell them it is near Marine Tower. Many taxi drivers do not know where the Ascott is, and also surprisingly they do not know many of the main landmarks in Shanghai. If they throw a wobbly, just get out of the taxi and get another one who knows where he is going. Overall, lovely accommodation, but be prepared to either cater for yourself in the kitchen, which has plentiful amenities, or go out to eat. Also, they do not exchange currency at this hotel, so you have to go to a bank or other exchange office. A final word of warning - it is difficult to get to anywhere walking at the moment in Shanghai due to the massive amount of building work taking place ahead of Expo 2010, which will take place summer 2010. You think you can walk somewhere, only to find your path blocked by a massive building site, and you have a 20 minute detour to skirt round it. The beautiful bund is also marred by huge amounts of building work at the time of writing. The whole of Pudong is awash with construction workers in orange hard hats. "
ascott pudong ,"Great place for long stays I stayed at the Ascott on three separate occasions in the span of two years. I had a great stay each time. The one bedrooms are pretty roomy and the bathrooms are large. There is a fitness center with an indoor pool and tennis/badminton court. We rented the courts a couple of times. They are fairly well kept.There is a little minimart on the first floor in case need something quickly. Otherwise, it is pretty expensive.The only thing that needed improvement was the menu in the restaurant. It was pretty tiring to eat the same thing all of the time. However, there is a free shuttle that will take you to a large mall a couple of minutes away. This mall also has a supermarket. The only thing is that it will not pick you up, so you'll have to get a taxi back. "
ascott pudong ,"Highly recommend the Ascott My husband and I, as well as our 10 year old son and nanny, stayed at the Ascott for 18 nights, while we participated at a conference at the nearby convention center. I personally never left the Pudong side of the river, so can't speak to how convenient the Ascott would be for that purpose. For getting to the International new convention center (attached to the oriental riverside hotel), it was about a 20 minute walk, which was a couple of blocks from the SuperBrand mall. The Ascott has a shuttle which goes there several times a day (they even took us directly to the convention center when we asked). Taxis were always easy to come by from the hotel, though we were not usually leaving during rush hour. The taxi ride was fast and cheap.We had both a one bedroom apartment and a two bedroom apartment. I had read in a couple of reviews that things were getting old in the apartments, but that was not the case at all for us. Everything was clean, and in new or nearly new condition. We were told when we arrived that we'd been upgraded to &quot;executive&quot; apartments, so perhaps that made the difference. The housekeeping service was excellent, and the staff always friendly and eager to please. At the front desk there was always someone who spoke English quite well, and they were able to make sure our taxi drivers knew where we were headed. As other reviewers have said, it is difficult to find the Ascott, but most drivers were able to at least come close with the directions we had written in Chinese, and we could usually get the rest of the way by pointing. Only once did I have to get out of a taxi and find a new one because the driver had no idea - didn't read any language I think.I was not crazy about the breakfast, but there were a lot of choices if you don't mind eating things that westerners don't normally consider &quot;breakfast food&quot; I stuck mostly to the hard-boiled eggs and pastries. There was fresh fruit every day - usually watermelon and either cantelope or orange segments.As far as the beds being hard, in our apartments they were firm but quite comfortable. The comforters were very nice. The water pressure was fine in the showers, though I did try to remember to turn the water on several minutes before hand as it took that long to warm up.I used the combination washer/dryer frequently. It was very slow - took several hours to wash and dry a small load, but things did come out okay (somewhat more wrinkled than at home, but there was an iron and ironing board).The internet service was great. We had a problem with our modem the first couple of days, but it was replaced and we had no problems after that. I had thought there would be some websites I couldn't get onto in China, but I was able to do everything I wanted, and quickly.The food from room service was not fantastic, but was fast cheap, and adequate. The small market onsite was useful for getting a few items, but if you are going to actually be cooking you'll need to go to the SuperCenter at the mall. Limited dishes and cookware are provided, but a lot more is kept in a locked cabinet in the kitchen, which they opened for us on request in one of our apartments.The fitness center was kept cool and comfortable and while there was only one elliptical, which is what I like to use, there was never anyone else there when I went. My son played tons of table tennis - the charge for using the table was low (less than $3 per hour), but we paid more than that to rent the paddles each time, so I suggest you bring your own if you'll be playing a lot. We'd planned to play tennis, but the indoor court was not air-conditioned and was just to hot for us. My son enjoyed kicking a ball around the soccer field (with goals),and the outdoor playground looked cute for younger kids.Hope this helps. I highly recommend the Ascott for luxurious serviced apartment accomodations, especially if you have business in that area. "
ascott pudong ,"Ascott is a comfortable apartment-like stay I stayed at the Ascott Pudong Shanghai for 2 months from June to August 2007. Here are my thoughts. I had a two-bedroom apartment on a high floor. I appreciated the balconies (3 of them), as I could let in fresh air and enjoy watching the rain. I wish the housekeeping personnel would clean the balconies, though, as they were quite dirty (from the dirt in the air) and I tracked a lot of it into the apartment (on the white carpeting) when I walked in and out. It is true that the Ascott is not as new as it once was, but it is a very nice place. The apartment was spacious and there was substantial closet space. I wish I had so much in my house back in the states!The master bath was wonderful. I appreciated the adjustable shower (as I am only 5 foot 3 inches), so that I could reach the shower head. The bathtub came in handy, as well. The second bathroom was adequate (what I usually get in most hotels) and my son enjoyed having his own bathroom when he visited me. The bedrooms are very nice. The blackout curtains don't quite black everything out, but they do an admirable job. The beds are a little hard (okay, pretty hard) and take some getting used to especially for us who are used to more cushioning. The alarm clock never quite worked, so I used the wake up system on the phone. It never failed me!I asked for a DVD player my 3rd week there and wish I had asked earlier (or that they had told me one was available). It made things a little easier when I couldn't sleep at night. The kitchen was workable and I appreciated having all the utensils, pots and pans there for me. I could concentrate on cooking, not on buying cookware, so that was nice. The common areas of the hotel are very nice--marble and such. An understated elegance that I do appreciate. The little store on site is a bit pricy, but nothing like the prices at other local hotels, and I did appreciate that (for instance, you can get a 12 oz can of soda on the street for 2 RMB, in the Ascott store it was 3 RMB, but in another hotel nearby (which shall remain nameless), my colleages were asked to pay 20 RMB). The clubhouse is very nice and the workout room and pool (and jacuzzi) never appear too busy. I always found room when I showed up. I do wish the front desk clerk at the clubhouse didn't sneak off for a smoke in the office nearby--we can still smell it in the lobby!The grounds are beautifully manicured. There are walking paths, a soccer field, a small playground, trees, tables and chairs, and a see-saw. The Ascott also has a shuttle service that leaves at pre-designated times to local shopping malls and tourist locations. I only used it twice, but it was nice to know that I didn't always have to pay for a taxi to get where I wanted to go. The breakfast is not on par with the buffet at the Intercontinental or even the breakfast offered at the Sofitel in town, but it is palatable. It has a variety of foods: eggs, congee, mashed potatoes, dumplings, fresh fruit, juices, coffee and hot chocolate, breads... and it can get a bit monotonous, but it fills me up. The room service menu is a bit dicey, too. I ordered the jumbo burger and was served soemthing that looked nothing like jumbo (it was two small patties) and very little like a burger (I'm not sure it was meat--it may have been soy). But other items like the Spaghetti Bolognaise was wonderful. Besides, I tended to use Sherpa or other delivery services if I didn't feel like cooking. I appreciated the staff most of all. They were very helpful. There was a little miscommunication at first regarding the inventory of items in my apartment, but we worked through that very quickly. The staff took pains to remember my name and which apartment I was in. They always worked hard to fulfill any request I made. Jessica Fang is an outstanding front desk manager. She even took it upon herself to start up a class for guests to learn useful Mandarin and taught it herself. It was nice to learn some Mandarin and also meet fellow guests. All in all, the Ascott was a good address to have for the two months I spent in Shanghai. I would recommend it for longer-term stays. "
ascott pudong ,"Pros and Cons The room provides you every thing you need, but things are getting old here. The carpet is kind of stained and dusty that I can feel it on my feet. The living room are spacy...the kitchen is nice but I never use it. The walk-in closet &quot;look&quot; nice but &quot;smell&quot; terrible like a few pair of damp shoes were there before. The bath room is not as functional and is designed for 7-feet tall people. In the morning 9 a.m. the maid got into my bedroom (well, she had to pass my living room, kitchen and there was another door to the bed room) and I was shocked. She saw me asleep and yet she asked (well...people here are loud by nature) if I want to have the room cleaned (!?) The breakfast is terrible, I could only eat the soy milk. Coffee sucks, it was from dripping machine. Bread and pastries are limited. Street buns and dumplings taste better, I belive. "
ascott pudong ,My kids love this hotel! We went there on oct 26 2006. It was a large apartment with two bedrooms. There are three televisions and a big kitchen. There even have a garden with a small children playground. Everything are nice and we enjoy our stay. This is a very good choice for family with kids. 
ascott pudong ,"Luxury service apartment in Shanghai Our family of 4 stayed for 2 nights at The Ascott Pudong. We had an apartment with 2 bedrooms (1 king, 2 twins) and 2 bath (2 tubs, 1 shower). We were pleased with how well appointed the rooms were. From the living room, there was a view across the Huangpo river, although not exactly of the Bund. The kids were excited to find that not only was there cable TV, but also a DVD player and VCD player (with all those gadgets why go sightseeing?). The kitchen was small and sparsely equipped, but enough material was at hand to make simple meals. There was a clothes washer and the appliances were clean and looked quite new.The hotel provides a shuttle service to a few of the more popular destinations, such as People's Square and that big shopping center in Pudong whose name I can't remember. The shuttle service is one way, however. No shuttle to the airport. Breakfast was the usual mixed Chinese and Western fare, although, surprisingly, with less variety than we had seen in our 2 weeks of journeying through China. A small point - although our apartment was clearly set up for 4 people, they would only give us breakfast tickets for 2.Finally, one of the drawbacks of the hotel is its location in the financial center of Pudong - somewhat removed from the cultural and historical center of Shanghai. In the 3 trips back to the hotel by taxi over 2 days, we could never get any of the 3 taxi drivers to figure out exactly where the hotel was. Although its address is Pudong Avenue, it is actually tucked behind a set of tall buildings so that its front entrance is not visible from the street. On the plus side, the taxi fare is low - about 17-22 RMB (US$2 to 3) from the city center - and it's about a 10 minute walk from the subway. "
asset hotel shanghai ,excellent hotel we stayed here 3 nights. we got good room and very good service. Staffs are very helpful the hotel is very clean and best 
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel - Good Service I have stayed at Shanghai hotel for 2 days. I felt very comfortable , the room was clean and quiet and the staffs are very nice. The food was not bad , it's ok . "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Disappointing i stayed at the asset hotel in a junior suite for 7 days. the suite is spacious and tastefully decorated though the carpet was a bit grubby. perhaps i expected too much reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews on tripadvisor, but my bathroom was… uhm… disappointing. it smelled mouldy and there was black mould in the corners of the shower and around the bathtub.okay, the hotel is truly a bargain and the staff is very helpful and friendly, but sorry, the poor breakfast and the cleanliness issue makes it only average for me. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Very helpful staff Good clean hotel, good location, close to metro station, reasonably priced restaurants just outside the hotel, breakfast served is basic but good, very helpful staff, communication in English is not a problem with staff at the reception. Would like to stay there again if I ever go back to Shanghai. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good clean hotel Arrived from the airport with a taxi and glad I did as this is a tough place to find. Its hidden away in a courtyard behind large apartment blocks. Taxi was £5 and hotel gave the taxi driver directions.This is a real good hotel and check in was quick and easy, staff spoke good English. Close to the metro station making it easy to get around the city.Breakfast is basic and not very good. Ate elsewhere. Hotel booked our train tickets to Beijing and they had them delivered to the hotel reception for us to collect with a minimal charge. Rooms very clean and relaxing. Building work was going on but the noise level wasnt to loud I think they are trying to get ready for the expo 2010.Very hellpful staff and they recommended yuan yuan restaurant around the corner. Good place to eat nice Chinese food menu and staff only to happy to help. Our waitress number 295 was the best, she did everything to make sure we had the food we wanted.Hotel organised a taxi and wrote tanslations into Chinese script.Management did a great job and would be happy to go back again. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"We like it ! Thanks to the previous comments that made me book this hotel. It is a very nice, little and clean place with friendly and helpful staffs. Nothing elaborated here but we were very much satisfied for the money we paid. We stayed for a week and really enjoyed going around Shanghai by the subway which can be easily reached. Some small chinese restaurants nearby are very good, particularly the fish menu. We cannot speak Chinese, but placing an order was not too difficult. A bit of drawing skill could help smooth the communication with the locals. Also there is a nice bread shop at the corner. The only drawback is that Chinese people are still heavy smokers and smoke seems to be everywhere even in a nice restaurant, not to mention the hotel itself. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Nice enough hotel but with some negatives... I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during my recent visit to Shanghai.The hotel is located in a courtyard away from the main street and it can be a real problem to find it. Local shop owners did not appear to be away of its excistence, which meant that it took me over 45 mins to find it. It is fairly close to the metro station and it takes about 20-30 mins to reach the centre. Staff working at the reception were polite and helpful. All the rooms (or so I was told) that were available during my stay we smoking rooms. The first room that I had a terrible stale stench of smoke. When I went back to the reception to ask for another room, I was given another smoking room, but it was less smelly. My room was nice, it was clean, had a nice telly and a safe. The view from it was not as nice, as it overlooked what I can only describe as a rubbish tip where people were sorting out through rubbish to get plastic bottles and other recyclable material.Another annoying thing was that on the 3rd night someone was clearing rubble and it continued until 1am! When I mentioned it to the reception staff when checking out the following day, they did not seem to be phased by what I was saying at all!I stayed on the third floor and it looked like the hotel was experiencing some leaks in the corridors and there were towels laid out on the florr to soak up the water. Some corridor walls were also badly water stained.I have to agree with other people who have commented on the hotel's breakfast, that it was terrible. I only had it once and decided to skip it all together. There are plenty of cheap eating places outside, so it wasn't much of a deal.There are a couple of computers with internet connection which can be used free of charge by guests.I would recommend this place to a friend, because of the value for money. This place is not a luxurious option, but a mid-range sleeping option and if you are not planning on spending a lot of time using its facilities, you will be just fine. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"A very nice good located and clean hotel. A great value. Stayed for 5 nights.A very nice, good located and clean hotel. A great value.Just 5 minutes walk to the subway and nearby small mall where you can find several restaurants and a good bakery. 10 minutes walk to the centre of the busy Xuhui District where a lot of department stores and restaurants are.The room has a little fridge and a safe. In the entrance is a little room with 2 computers for free use.The whole staff was very friendly and attentive; receptionist speaks English and is helpful.Because of roof works on our floor we had to move to another room. The lady manager was very friendly and felt really sorry for it. But we were rewarded by a junior suite:-) "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel... I enjoyed staying at the Asset Hotel in SEP 09. The location is a bit out of the main part of the city, but you are near a subway stop, Dong An Road, Line 4 (not Stadium stop). If I remember, correctly, when you come out of the turnstiles, go right and then exit up the steps on the left (exit 2??), then walk straight until the next major intersection, Wangping Lu. Cross the street to the big bank on your right, then cross Wangping. The hotel driveway entrance is right near that corner on Wangping down the alley. http://www.smartshanghai.com/maps/smsh_map.phpI thought the front desk staff was extremely helpful with writing directions in Chinese. The front desk staff spoke English, however certain employees spoke much better. They would research on line the exact address I wanted. They provide an English/Chinese map.The rooms were basic, however enough for a stay. My room was the second to smallest, which worked fine for a single traveler. Free wired internet with your own computer, in room and 2 free computers in the lobby. Basic cable with a few English channels, mini fridge, safe and self controlled A/C. No hairdryer, that I saw, or iron. I did not do laundry. I thought the bed was a tad hard, but better than the other places I stayed. The breakfast was a combo of Asian/Western. Yes, repetitive, but included in the room price. On the western side, scrambled eggs, bread/pastry, cereal, fruit, and coffee/tea. You will have to taken public transportation or taxis when at this hotel, but I feel for the price, it's worth it. If you want a great massage for cheap (88 RMB) try Butterfly Massage north of the hotel. It has the Aveda feel when you enter. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good place to stay for business If you are looking for a luxury 5 star hotel in the middle of Shanghai, don't go here. But for someone comfortable with Shanghai and looking for a decent but inexpensive place, this is a great find. I stayed there this week for a night. Check in was great, room was ok, free internet, free breakfast, lots of good small local restaurants and stores. But it is not near People's Square, which is fine for me. For the price, you can afford a bunch of taxi rides and still come out cheaper than other similar places in Shanghai. Even the breakfast had coffee and eggs which is unusual for a Chinese hotel. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"GOOD VALUE IN SHANGHAI We stayed here for three nights. The hotel had clean, well appointed rooms, and surprisingly comfortable beds - for a Chinese hotel! They were the best that we slept on in two weeks in China. The front desk staff were very helpful, and most spoke good English. They have a decent enough breakfast ( included in our rate of 288 yuan/night), and there are plenty of restaurants just around the corner for an evening meal. The location was quiet, but a bit out of the way, but you could get anywhere in Shanghai with two subway stations within a 10 minute walk, and plenty of taxis available. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good value for money We stayed for seven nights in a junior suite which was just as it looks on the photos. The hotel was within an easy five minute walk to the Shanghai Stadium Railway station and only cost 8 yuan for two of us to get into Nanjing Street (less then $1.50). While the staff spoke limited English, they were friendly and helpful. There were free computers you could use downstairs although they were very slow. Breakfast was not great but adequate. Scrambled eggs, toast, cereal and fruit and a heap of asian style dishes. Scrambled eggs were nearly always cold, but you could gesture the lady to heat up in microwave. They do not cook eggs to your request. Room was well equipped although no iron however getting stuff laundered was dirt cheap. It cost less then $10 to have three shorts and a pair of capri pants drycleaned. There was a library where previous guests have left reading material which you could use. One day the hotel had a problem with the water pipes and the water was brown when you first turned the shower on. The hotel refunded us 100 yuan for the inconvenience. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"A pleasure to stay at! I have stayed at the Asset hotel for one week now, and will be staying another week more. I have been more than satisfied with the hotel and it's services. I'm staying at a business-double and can easily feel that this is a &quot;home-away-from-home&quot;! The location is not the Puxi, but I feel that the Xuhui is a very pleasant neighbourhood. Remember, that the shortest way to the subway is to turn RIGHT at the front door. This took me a while to figure it out...;).I've been to five-star hotels too, and this is not one of those. But for a 3+ this is very nice. There is a fixed internet-line in the room, which has worked well, you get your daily waterbottles, toothbrushes, combs, nursing kit (nail-file and schwabs), slippers etc. The view from the window is not great, but there's a roof-terrace with a garden surrounded by high apartment-buildings. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Not really what Trip Advisor had led me to expect Firstly we arrived at 9am, Check in was to be at 2. It was raining heavily and we were soaked having walked from the subway. I explained how we'd just traveled from Beijing and the kids were tired, if our room was available could we check in? Now i dont fall for the Chinese Hotel Scam, which basically is they charge 2 rates for a room. The first rate is the basic rate, i.e if its a double room and you tunr up alone you pay the room rate - Even though there is just one of you. Which is fair enough. Well the second rate is per person, so if 3 of you are staying in a double room suddenly you get charge the double room rate plus 50%Now i am traveling with a 4 year old and a 7 year old. I only ever put down my 7 year old. The hotel were telling me there wouldn't be enough room, i explained my 4 year old would sleep with me or her brother in the same bed and he gave it the proper hard sell trying to upgrade me to a business suite. I was having none of it and he let us check in at 9am. That is worth a mention because that genuinely is a great thing. Expecting to be in a Junior suite i was stunned when we arrived at our 'suite' It was a tiny room with one double bed in it. Not wanting to push my luck we settled in and it was three in a bed. The room looked like a modern affair set in an aged room. The walls were mouldy and the TV from the 1800's. But the hotel do provide a DVD player and let you borrow DVD's at no charge.Breakfast was ridiculous.The location is really for me what sells this hotel. Its out of the way but within easy reach to the Subway. It is surrounded by shops, banks, restaurants etc... And is actually in what i felt was an ideal location to get away from the hustle and bustle of Shanghai. But, despite all the negativity i felt the rooms had the price is really what convinced me to stay in the first place and what would convince me to stay again. Just dont expect a great hotel and you'll not be disappointed when you get an average, cheap hotel a few years past its sell by date. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"hidden little gem of a hotel at a bargin price I've been in China for five years and know well the horrors of a local hotel when seen from the Expat perspective and if you're looking for five star glamour, dont go to Asset hotel. If you are looking for clean rooms and incredibly friendly staff, then this is the best value for money in Shanghai.Often, Staff will be aloof when the level of english is low and to be honest, it IS low among some of the lower level staff, however this does not deter them in the least. they smile ALL the time, they are polite and friendly and outgoing and this is like a marked breath of fresh air.And Speaking of Air,, the Air cons work like champs, a must in Shanghais brutal summer, there's a limited selection of English TV and it IS very limited so if you're planning to hole up in your room, you might want to bring along some DVDs to go in the complimentary DVD player.the Business room was the one I selected and they each have a small fridge and coffee station, and there are convenience stores within 50 meters of the location. It is NOT on a metro line, but the friendly front desk staff will get you a taxi in record time and explain to your driver where you're headed. and it's minutes from the Xujiahui shopping area if you need a taste of expensive shopping.It is not the best of views, and the primary building is tucked back on a side street, however I noticed little to no traffic noise with the windows closed.Breakfast selection is small but adequate and there's an effort to cater to both the Locals and the tourists, with a selection of eggs and toasts and crossiants. Additionally, probably the best cup of coffee I've had in Shanghai and a friendly staff who grin at your efforts to say the names of things and offer pronunciation tips it's really a nice experience.Beds are, as other posters mentioned right in the middle of the chinese &quot;so hard you can't sleep&quot; and too soft for comfort, they have placed an egg crate on each bed to soften the experience and I'm quite sure if one is not good enough for you they'll bring another..there's a distinctive European influence in the furnishings and while you might see the occassional bit of water stain in a hallway, the building is in remarkable good repair with carpeted rooms and super fast internet too.In short, i found this place to be excellent value for money, so much so, that I've asked for a monthly rate for my return while I hunt for a flat. I'd recommend it highly for an expat on a budget. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"A great hotel for the budget-conscious traveler The Asset Hotel is almost perfect for the budget traveler. Price, location and quality are outstanding in its price range. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous, and their English skills are adequate. They really seem to care about making sure you have a good stay. The standard rooms are fairly small, but clean and comfortable. I reserved a business room online for about $45 a night. The junior suites are much roomier, but cost at least $10 more. Each room comes with a fairly hard mattress (typical for China I understand), a small desk, a small flat-screen TV that picks up mostly Chinese, but a couple English-language Asian news channels such as NHK from Japan. Internet is provided in each room via Ethernet cable. Speeds are slow but adequate. There is a tiny business center near the lobby with two Internet terminals.Location is excellent -- about a 7 minute walk to the Dong'an subway station. The Shanghai Metro is excellent and can get you just about anywhere you need to go in the city for 40-60 yuan. The neighborhood around the hotel has a few small 7-11 type convenience stores for drinks and snacks, a few coffee shops, and small restaurants -- but be aware, only a few have English menus. Breakfast is included -- a small buffet with a mixture of Chinese and Western hot and cold selections. Quality and selection are decent and enough to get you started for the day.It's not the Four Seasons, but for its price, it's a fantastic bargain. "

Well, Asset did well on most of these - RMB260 a night including a decent breakfast? GREAT value. Location? Fine. Bed? A BIT softer than some but still very &quot;Chinese&quot; in feel. Summary? Good value if you can take a hard sleep. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"A very nice clean and comfortable hotel! Based on reviews of Shanghai hotels and the budget we had, we decided to book a big room at the Asset 3* Hotel rather than a standard room at a 4* or 5* Hotel. We booked a non-smoking Junior Suite and were extremely happy with it! It was spacious and well decorated and basically looks exactly like the photos on their website. Our friends also booked a Junior Suite and their room was just as nice. The staff were very friendly but did not speak amazing English. The breakfast is also reasonable. A basic selection of Chinese and Western foods.The location is great - 5-10min walk to the subway which can get you anywhere in Shanghai. There are some cool spots around the hotel like the 24hr bakery across the street. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"great value location is either a plus or minus depending on your travel style Stayed here for 5 nights. Check-in was swift, with English-speaking manager providing us with useful tourist maps and info, without us needing to ask, which was a nice gesture. Room was a decent size, not overly large but not tiny either, well appointed with chair, desk, ample space for luggage and TV with ample English, Chinese and Japanese language cable channels. No room service but the hotel provides a &quot;sherpa's&quot; guide to shanghai restaurants that deliver, ranging from Shanghainese to Indian to Western; as we were tired and travel weary we took advantage of this.Breakfast was simple but adequate. In-room internet complimentary and fast.Now for the negatve points-- location is both good and bad. I loved the natural residential neighbourhood, as it felt more 'real' than anywhere else in sterile Shanghai, though taking the subway to tourist attractions can be tiring. Before you stay here, ask yourself if you really have to be in the thick of the attractions; if so, maybe choose another hotel. For most attractions, a transfer to a different subway line is necessary-- that particular line runs infrequently and we often had to wait 10 - 15mins for the next train. While more expensive than the bargain subway, taxis are quite cheap and fast. The other negative is the shower-- I saw the beginnings of a mould problem that perhaps show a lacklustre cleaning effort. It wouldn't take much energy to scrub it away before it starts to lower the tone of the room. Lastly, I would aim for a room at the back of the hotel. There is a kind of atrium at the front, and if your room is at the front, like ours was, you can hear all the lobby conversations, which was a little annoying.Overall, for what we paid, a good deal. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"jog thru China Nice budget hotel; nice clean, well maintained room. Not in thick of things, but in a nice residential neighborhood with plenty of amenities and close to the subway with easy access to to the rest of the city. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good Deal showers not super clean location not central Great deal paid about 40 $ a night.Internet is fast, its a 30 yuan taxi ride to the Bund, but metro is quick and cheap.Showers were a little dirty, but otherwise place seemed in tip top shape. I would have asked for another room but we arrived at 1am and needed to crash. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great Value for Money We booked this hotel based on Trip advisor reviews. The hotel is well located although taxis did have a little bit of trouble looking for it. However, our drivers knew the name of the road and where the road is. The hotel itself is hidden in a courtyard. Upon arrival, staff were helpful with the baggage, check in was quick and we were soon in our room.The business queen room, while not the smallest room I've seen certainly wasn’t roomy either. However, it was very comfy and nice, well maintained and clean. For the price, we were most satisfied. The free internet worked fine and was quite fast too. The bathroom had a supply of thick towels, toiletries and toothbrushes, as well as an array of other amenities. In room slippers were also provided, as was a safe which was easy for us to store our belongings.We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood where the hotel is located. We found the metro station nearby, but we didn’t use it and used taxis mostly. There is a convenience store nearby beside Guci café which is a stone’s throw from the hotel. Hotel mini bar prices were also surprisingly affordable.The buffet breakfast is also good. They have a small and pleasant dining room which has a supply of bread, bao, eggs, porridge, meatballs, etc…certainly a good start which kept us going! Of course, it isn’t a five star breakfast but it was good , tasty, and also constantly replenished.All in all, for the price, it certainly was a satisfying stay, and would recommend this hotel. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great budget hotel Asset hotel is one of the best budget hotels my girlfriend and I have ever stayed in. They were easy to contact via email, the hotel itself is a great value for money, and it's near enough to two train stations that it's very easy to get around shanghai. Convenience stores and some restaurants are located nearby in case you want to step out for a quick snack, and overall their staff were very polite (a rarity in the chinese service industry, as far as our experiences have shown).The room was large enough and tastefully decorated. The bathroom worked excellently and was restocked everyday. The breakfast buffet was satisfactory, if a little same-y (not much variety over the 3 days we were there), mostly scrambled eggs, vegetables, meatballs, congee and dimsum, with cereal and bread for western diners.However there was one issue we had that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. We requested a hotel pickup , which cost 250 RMB. Upon arriving in Shanghai's pudong airport at roughly 12am, we could not find a sign with my name on it. We walked around for 15 minutes before eventually calling the hotel and asking if the pickup had arrived. Unfortunately the girl on the line didn't speak english very well, and she told us to &quot;just take a taxi to the hotel&quot;, which we did. 3 days later, on the day of our departure, Mr. Reynold the hotel manager approached us and informed us that the pickup was there until 1 and since the hotel had already paid for the service, he asked (in a very polite manner, I must add) if we would be willing to pay half of the original charge (125 RMB) to over the cost.I felt that this was quite unfair to us as we had walked the length of the airport already at 12am and were told by his own staff that we should take a taxi there. He explained that his night staff weren't very good with english, and while I understood his side of the story ultimately I felt that the hotel should take the hit for the misunderstanding. Eventually I offered to use the advance deposit we made upon check-in to the hotel (worth 100RMB) as recompense, and mr. Reynold, while he didn't look too happy about it, agreed.I think that Pudong airport's procedures with regards to waiting for arrivals were the main cause of this problem, as upon our departure we saw a sign that said &quot;meeting area&quot;. Perhaps the taxi was there, and yet when you exit the bagage claim area there are already numerous people with signs of hotels and guest names, so it can be very confusing.I would highly recommend staying at the Asset Hotel if you visit Shanghai, but it would probably be best to take a taxt (or an airport car as we did) to get to the hotel. We paid 200RMB for the airport car, which was lower than what asset hotel had to offer, though I think if you bargain enough you can get it even lower. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good service attitude Instead of our usual choice of international hotel chain in Shanghai, my friend and I decided to save some good money for our shopping this time round. We spent a total of five nights in Asset Hotel in Sep 2008, and were happy with our decision. We chose to stay at Asset Hotel after having seen the hotel management's response to a bad review on tripadvisor.com. We took it as an indication that the hotel takes a serious view about their business and indeed, it turned out to be quite true. Shanghai city maps, metro maps and tourist information were made readily available near the hotel's entrance. This had not been the case for some of the five star hotels which we had previously stayed in Shanghai - we have to ask for them. The counter staff also attended to our queries patiently and took efforts to find out for us if they did not have the answer at hand. The good service attitude have compensated for the lesser aspect of the hotel - the location, breakfast and some of the room fittings, which are not very big problems that can be overcomed quite easily.Taxi drivers generally do not know Asset Hotel. Some of them took a long time to locate the property even when we furnished them with the exact address: 590 Wanping Road South. Hence, it is important to further tell the taxi drivers that the hotel is located near, or more specifically, diagonally opposite Longhua Hospital. However, if one does not mind taking the crowded subway and doing with a 7 to 10 min walk, one can alight at Dongan Lu station (Line 4), get out of the station at exit no. 2 or 3, walk straight until one reaches a cross junction (where a &quot;Guci Cafe&quot; is visibly situated), the hotel is only a stone throw from there. We also found the hotel breakfast to be rather inadequate, in terms of both quality and quantity. The staff had appeared rather hessitant, or unsure of whether to replenish the food when they ran out (usually by 9am). Hence, we spent most of the days taking our breakfast outside as good food are very affordable and easily available in Shanghai. We stayed in a junior suite on the second floor and found the room to be on the whole very clean, though we observed that paint on some parts of the wall are peeling off. We have also observed that hooks for hanging clothes are not available in the bathroom and it was a hassle to take hangers into the bathroom. Given that the entire bathroom was tiled in white ceremics, brown stains in between the tiles were also quite visible.Nonetheless, on the whole it has been a pleasant stay. The free internet access is a big plus point. It has allowed us to do some last minute planning and facilitate our change of travel plans. We did not encounter any slowness or difficulties when accessing the net. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel Friendly Staff I stayed at the Asset Hotel for 19 nights last month, and I can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good hotel at a good price. The staff from door keepers/security over front desk personnel to room maids and breakfast service is very friendly , helpful and establish a good atmosphere, so that you soon feel at home. My room (superior single) was clean, air conditioning, LCD-TV , refrigerator all working well. The breakfast buffet offers a vast variety of Asian and Western style food: scrambled egg, spinach, sweet and meat-stuffed dumplings (baozi, jiaozi, mantou), fried noodles, croissants, toast, jam, peanut butter, rice/ soup, corn flakes, melon/apples, milk orange juice, tea, coffee, water etc.., all very tasty and hygienically presented by the staff who wear masks.Two subway stations (Line 4) are located within a 7 minutes walk from the hotel, Dong An and Shanghai Stadium, also supermarket, local convenience stores and restaurants are nearby.As mentioned in an earlier review, there are problems with the speed of the internet connection, but since my friends told me this is rather common in all Shanghai, I can't blame it to the hotel.To sum it up, good value for your money! "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Asset Hotel gets better This is my second review of the Asset Hotel. The first was after a stay last October when I unexpectedly checked out early from another hotel because of very poor customer service. Now, after many others have “discovered” and reviewed the Asset, I returned for two separate stays of two nights and six nights in May to see what has changed.In January I had the two-room executive suite, not as preferable as the Junior Suite. The room is not as sunny and the bath is considerably smaller. The furnishings for each are about the same. If you really want a separate sleeping room and two TVs, then go for the executive suite. Otherwise, I think you will enjoy the junior suite more.The rooms all are being refurbished and I stayed in a newly redecorated junior suite at a rate of around US$75 for promotional low-season. I have attached a new picture of this room. The brown toned décor is restful and classy. There are sheer Roman blinds along with room darkening drapes. New brown carpet is on the floor, and the rooms on the west side are very sunny most days. You get what you pay for at the Asset. If you pick the lowest promotional rate room, you get a small room, paying around US$30 or so for western-style accommodations in Shanghai. (I passed by and peeked into several types of rooms during remodeling.) The rate you are quoted is the final rate, with nothing added at checkout. Everyone gets the free limited breakfast and China Daily newspaper at the front desk. The hotel enjoys its high ratings based on its commitment to customer service. All the front desk personnel, as well as housekeeping, are so cooperative and willing to help. They smile all the time, and seem genuinely happy in their jobs. Although most do not have a conversational use of English, they try hard and get help so they understand your needs. There is always one person on duty with knowledge of English. On the negative, the free in-room wired internet was terribly slow this time, equivalent to dial-up speeds. The TV cable has CNN back on as well as ESPN, Star movies and National Geographic. Perhaps the biggest drawback has been the location in the XuHui district, near the Xujiahui shopping area, and that now has a nice resolution. The missing link to the Inner Circle (Line 4) and Line 8 of the Subway are now open, so within five-seven minutes you can enter the subway station (Shanghai Stadium) and get to most tourist areas in the city, including Pudong and the Longyang Station (Line 2) for connection to the airport Maglev. The standard fare of about 4 yuan (US 60 cents) gets you everywhere downtown quickly with very clean and bright stations and cars. I took the completely bilingual subway a lot this time because of the new convenience and Shanghai's traffic gridlock from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Subway to East Nanjing Road was quicker by five minutes and cheaper than a taxi. See subway map at [--]. Even in heavy daytime rains, the hotel was able to summon a taxi for me in several minutes.As prices rise all over Shanghai, and the American dollar continues to slide versus the RMB (yuan), this value-oriented hotel continues to provide great rooms with friendly helpful people. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"China I stayed at the junior suite by taking up a recommendation from one of the suggestions I've read. At first I was sketchy about the quality of the hotel so I placed a reservation for only a night through the hotel website for less than UDS 80. The quality of the hotel exceeded way over my expectations, the room and area was quiet, and I felt like I really got the relaxation I've been wanting. Instead of staying for a night, I changed my mind and stayed the rest of my trip. The hotel even offered free transportation to the airport for me because of my extended stay in the suite and that really made me enjoy my stay even more. I felt like the hotel treated me very kindly and the staff couldn't have been friendlier and helpful about my questions.Some things that could improve was that the hotel didn't provide any foreign exchange, so that was not convinient because I had to go to the bank. Also, it was not as near to some tourist spots therefore I had to go by taxi but luckily the taxi fare was cheap, but there were lots of great shopping spots and restaurants near so that was good! I enjoyed my stay very much! "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Helpful Staff My friend in Shanghai booked the hotel for me. I'd say the hotel exceeded my expectations in its rate-range. To me it's a good bang for the buck.Besides my nice clean room, it's the staff that impressed me most. they satisfied my requests quickly. That's the main reason I'm writing this review, with the breakfast (yes, hot food and complimentary!) and the free shuttle bus being the bonuses.With so many hotels to choose from, I'd say I'll stay with Asset again the next time I'm in Shanghai. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Nasty and cheap After reading reviews about this hotel, I thought it would be a nice place to stay, but I got disappointed.Arriving at the hotel, the first impression was real good. On the outside it looked real nice and even the entrance was quite impressing. After a quite speedy check-in, we were brought to the room and from there on I'd rather forget what I saw.The room was Small, capital S. The window couldn't open, the curtains were dusty, the sheets on the bed felt like they were put on there still wet, the size of the bathroom was kinda okay, but the shower was real dirty. There were some kind of brown stains in the corner; it just looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned for months! Next to that, we had a room which was on the end of the hallway, which was, I thought in the beginning, kinda nice. But after spending just a couple minutes in the room, I changed my mind. Right outside our room was a staircase for emergencies. Since they were painting the building and all people were running up and down that metal stairs all the time. What a noise! And besides that noise, there was all sort a noise coming from outside, even though it's not located right next to a road. And by the way, the breakfast is horrible. There was not much to choose from and the orange juice is just aweful.Luckily we stayed there for just one night!! "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Overrated but okay. Perhaps some of the earlier reviews have been coated with a bit too much sugar. Asset doesn't have much going for it, but also, doesn't have much going against it. its a small hotel on wanping road, in the southern part of the city, far away from the downtown area of shanghai. Hence, we're talking of 30 to 45 minutes commuting everyday, up and down. this isn't too bad a deal if you're a tourist willing to take the metro or the bus, as thats the best way to see the city, but hey, this point doesn't directly be awarded to the hotel, its just one of those ancillary things. Anyway, the breakfast is bleak, but at least its there, unlike a lot of other places in china. the staff is helpful, although they sometimes don't understand what you're saying, and still say yes, later to screw up. To summarise, asset is an average hotel situated far from the main attractions of the city. Choose this hotel if you're on a tight budget, otherwise look for something else which may cost a little more, but is closer to where the action is. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel for the price We booked the hotel through our travel agent about 2 weeks before our trip. We were throughly happy with our stay. The hotel was clean, safe, and quiet. The hotel is located on this one way street, although very easy accessible from the other streets surrounds it. The hotel is done similarly to the Travel Lodge in the US. The room has a fridge and a safe deposit box inside, and all the little things that comes with regular rooms. The hotel also has complimentary breakfast that has coffee, milk, orange juice, fruit, eggs, various Chinese style foods, toasts, and fruits. The hotel also has 2 computers for guests to use. The hotel is within 10 minute walking distance to various popular locations and underground stations. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Good place to stay in Shanghai I spent last weekend in Shanghai and found the Asset Hotel on the booking.com website. For a traveller exploring the City by Metro and walking it is a good choise. Just 5 minutes walk to Shanghai Stadium (circle line), approx 30 minutes to the Bund by Metro . Heng Shan Lu with its bars and restaurants is also not far away.The staff was very friendly and at least at the front desk English speaking. The rooms are not very modern equipped, but cozy and clean. And also a simple western style breakfast was available. All in all I was satisfied and can recommend this hotel for budget travellers. I paid only 208 RMB (approx 20 EUR) per night, that is a very good rate in Shanghai and valid up to the End of February 2008. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"A Hidden Gem Before I arrived I was worried about a sub-$100 [USD] hotel in Shanghai. Having to cut through a parking lot and up between some tall buildings to find the entrance did not ease my worries either... but.. This hotel is really a gem. By Western standards, I would say it's a 3 star hotel. Not many amenities, the rooms are a bit plain, some rooms are small. I chose to upgrade [why not, the price was right] and found myself in a 2-room suite with a large living room and bedroom. Rooms are very plain [now I'm repeating myself, so, it must be true]. I commented to the hotel manager as I was leaving and she said they were working with a consulting company on updating the colors and furniture.. Honestly, this would be a awesome place to turn into an art-deco-style hotel... Lots of potential.. I'm looking forward to seeing what they turn it into..On the plus side, the hotel staff is excellent... Very excellent. Warm and friendly. Rooms were very clean. Beds were comfortable [not hard!]. The internet connection was speedy [not always the case in China hotels] and there were some good places to eat [local food] nearby. Check out the location carefully before booking. If your business in Shanghai is on this side of town, this hotel is highly recommended. If you'll be heading to do tourist stuff on the Bund, this is not a good location as the direct subway line around the south side of the city (between here [Dong An Lu station] and the Bund) is not yet completed. You'll need to go way around through the city center if you're riding the trains.Shanghai is one of my favorite cities in the world and this hotel is a very nice bargain if you find it to be in a convenient location. If you want a more central location, check out &quot;The Bund Hotel&quot; for another great bargain. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Cozy Hotel Sitting in the hotel now, and I have to say its very comfortable. The rooms are small so if thats not your bag dont come but if you can deal with it everything else is top noch including the service which is priceless and anyone who's been to China knows good service is priceless. (hard to come by sometimes). Its geared towards foreigners with a directory in English and Mandarin. Because the room is small its quick to heat up or cool down. Comes with a mini fridge, even an electronic lock box. The shower is nice but no bath tub. They serve breakfast in the morning which is nice if your trying to save money.The hotel is hidden between buildings but very close to the street, you wont hear loud honking cars going by. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Value for money If you want to have a cheap, clean hotel then I would recommend this one. Yes it is 3 star, but for 200RMB it is great value- clean, healthy breakfast and a good place to stay for a few days. We ended up using the metro to do some sightseeing- about a 10 minute walk and of course the metro is easy to use. Only problem might be for your taxi driver to find the hotel- as others have said. Although I printed out the address and instructions from sinohostel ( the booking agent I used) I also printed out instructions from other web sites- eg shanghaihotels- which the taxi driver ended up using. A good base for sightseeing. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Quite the hotel! Despite its location (10km+ to the Bund), this hotel is quite unique. It's hidden from the busy streets nearby and quite frankly it's a good thing seeing the amount of construction projects being realized in the area. Location = ok.... however - you have to subway it or cab it to get to Shanghai's main attractions (i.e. The Bund or Pudong ect.) - minor detail when you consider how inexpensive taxis are in Shanghai. Staff = exceeded expectations - it was nice to see such a dedicated staff! Breakfast = ok - quite pleased that it was included in my room rate (33$/night - check out www.asiatravel.com). Overall = Great value! "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Boutique hotel!! I've just arrived form Shanghai, and I found two new reviwes on Asset Hotel. I have to say that they perfectly describe this little pear (and better than me, since english is not my mother language).Also, I was a little worried about the first two reviews because they were too good to be both true (I'm sorry not to have trusted you, mates!!) What could I add? Warm welcome, good English at the reception (even if I faced a problem in a late morning asking a place for golf shopping), clean and fresh rooms, very good prices (27 euro/night Superior single room B/B, 30 euro/night twin room B/B).. The management was very helpfully during our stay, set up our Airport transfer at a very reasonable price; opening their &quot;meeting&quot; room when they saw three of us sitting in the sofa near the entrance deciding where to go for dinner; smiling every time he saw us in our 7days stay..I have been given a double room at ground floor: not so dark, with fences at the windows, twin beds, two complimentary water bottles every day.. bathroom full of towels and complimentary items, cleaned every day..Free cabled internet in room, perfectly working (ok, not so fast, but I found many slower in China!!). Two computers connected to internet are available for free just in front of the main entrance.No CCN on my Tv (no LCD), but my collegues told me they had it in their rooms!!).Now, I have to report something not perfect, or somebody will not believe to our reviews!!Let's start:Breakfast: very poor - I've been in a 3star hotel in Shanghai last year paying the same money but Breakfast was a lot more better. Many Chinese breakfast food, and just very few for what &quot;we&quot; European are used to have.. small brioches (plastic taste), white breaded toast with just one jam.. A very good orange juice (even if not fresh) was something it worth to wake up in the morning.Location: mhhhh - if you know Shanghai, it is located in the &quot;south/west&quot; part of the city, just 1 km from inner Ring road Wanping exit. Subway is just 5 minutes walking, and you have to change the line to go to Nanjing Road/The Bund. The purple line is new, but the line is not finished yet: even in pick hours, trains can be waited for more than 10 minutes, so the trip to the Bund can takes about 30/40 minutes at least. When the line will be finished (maybe next week, thinking about Chinese construction timing) I think it will take just 20 minutes to go there. So, you are not in the heart of the city, even if you are not far away from it. But, in peak hours, it can take also 1 hour to reach the main touristic attraction (Yu Gardens, Bund, etc). If you are going to visit the Exhibition, it can take more than 1 hours (Subway takes 60 minutes and a 15 minute walking). So, other hotels can be more suggested for their location.. remind these times while organizing your travels. Also, consider that from/to the airport the taxi takes about 90 minutes in peak hours!Noise: very high in the early morning - we have been waken up at 7.00 every morning by a truck loading trashes.. and they were starting demolishing a cover garage under the windows of the frontal right wing - starting their work at 7.30 hammering the surface. Well, probably we were just unlucky.. What else can I add? Everything has been wrote on this small but beautiful hotel.. I suggest you to consider to stay there, very good quality/price ratio, with some small problems which can be forgotten easily just thinking to all the nice advantages you'll face sleeping there. Hoping, of course, that popularity will not make price raise and quality follow (as sometimes happens). "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Great Value Functional Rooms in Shanghai If you're looking for cheap, I averaged USD $33 per night, clean, functional rooms in Shanghai, look no further. The hotel is located down a driveway near the corner of LingLing Lu and WanPing Nan Lu in the heart of Xuhui District. You're within walking distance to the Shanghai Stadium. (A Special Olympics family was staying there during my stay.) And the No. 4 line of the subway system. Short taxi rides to Grand Gateway, and a bit longer ride to Nanjing and Huaihai Lu areas.I believe I got a &quot;superior&quot; room. The queen-sized bed was comfortable for me, but I like a bit of a harder surface. (Most all beds in SH are quite hard for US standards.) The bathroom was large, with a glass enclosed shower only (no bathtub). A small refrigerator as well as in-closet safe were included. A great feature was the air conditioner, it cooled down the room very quickly. A small, 18-in flat screen TV was hoisted in a corner. A small desk was good enough to plug-in the provided LAN cable, and Internet access was free and speedy.One negative: the room walls are thin... I could hear the next room couple talking, as well as him snoring late in the evening.I've got one more session in 3 weeks, and have already booked my next stay. If you want a place to store your things, sleep overnight, and be out/about during the days and evenings for really cheap... book the Asset. Oh, the hotel has quirky stairs and ramps along each corridor. The elevator is in the middle of these &quot;sloping&quot; hallways. Quite a bit of stairs to navigate unless you're next to the elevator bay.I didn't try their morning bkfst, but lots of options nearby. "
asset hotel shanghai ,"Helpful staff Amazing breakfast This hotel is amazing. The free Western and Chinese breakfast was awesome - cereal, dumplings, coffee, eggs etc. The hotel staff spoke English and were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is about 2 blocks away from the subway. The hotel was very clean. It was great! "
asset hotel shanghai ,"The Gem of Shanghai Outstanding hotel, with 5-star-plus service! Over the years, on business and pleasure trips, I have stayed at several hundred hotels, but this one ranks in the top three. Super excellent, always prompt service, exceedingly clean rooms, halls, reception area. Staff very, very helpful, even with several urgent and &quot;crazy&quot; requests I had! English spoken here is very good, some speak as well as native speakers. Hotel located in Xuhui, a very nice part of Shaghai, near several busy streets, but is set off the street a little, and, as a result, was very, very quiet. Seemingly everything (shopping, Shanghai Museum, even a number of consulates, etc.) are only a short, inexpensive taxi ride away, and definately not a problem. If you notify them in advance, they will pick you up at the airport. My top cudos, and my future &quot;home&quot; in Shanghai. --vn "

bailemen hotel ,"Good Location Excellent Value with Minor Problems One of my husband's officemates recommended this hotel and I didn't have any regrets booking at this hotel. First of all, we paid for RMB1,074.00 for 4 days and 3 nights. Quite inexpensive right? That also includes one buffet breakfast for each day. Since I was with my mother the whole stay, I just had to pay for RMB20 for another buffet breakfast. Check-in and check-out was fast though I was requested to press my atm pincode because it was offline. So I had to go to nearest ATM machine to check if my balance is still correct after the transaction. The minute we walked inside the room, I was surprised that the room was bigger than what I expected. It smelled like cigarette smoke so I called the reception for my complaint. After a whole day of city tour the next day, the smell was no longer there. Thank goodness! The sheets were clean, well pressed and no stains. They provided double window panes to prevent dust to come in because there is a big building construction just across the hotel. Bailemen is next to a bustling train station and also the famous Jingan Temple. We went to most of the places by train so it is very convenient. The food during breakfast had so many Chinese varieties. I hope there will be more Western as well. The coffee in the dispenser is strong so don't forget to add hot water. But for those who want to energize, it is perfect for you. "
bailemen hotel ,"Great location. Not too western crowd... I recently (August 2008) had just one night to spend in Shanghai on my way back to Europe from Nanking. I had to choose: stay an hour out of town for about 250 rmb, or closer to town, for more. Sometimes much more. This was a perfect compromise. It is located just next to a beautiful, lively Buddhist temple (Jing An Ci), it is clean and about 50 m from the No. 2 subway line, which goes downtown and connects nicely with the Mag Lev to the airport. The clientele was mainly Chinese, all very nice, and the staff were fine, patient and spoke English well. The room was clean and well appointed. I would happily go back. "
bailemen hotel ,"good clean and convenient Bailemen hotel is conveniently located across the subway station in shagnhai, You can hop on the quick and easy subway to many parts of the city within minutes.The hotel room is clean and roomy, and includes a good variety breakfast for one person.There is a 24 hrs mcdonald next to the hotel, plus many restaurants and shops within a few blocks.

bailemen hotel ,"Good Location and nice breakfast The hotel was classified as a 3* hotel and we pay less than S$500 for 4night. Location near the Jingan Temple, about 5min walk from the Metro.The room maid is helpful,my hubby step on a broken glass inside the room, and immediately the room maid got a vaccum to clean the whole carpet again. Taxi is very easy to get and it will bring you anywhere. Check in/out was fast. Breakfast comes in western and local delight, not too bad, quite a variety. The famous Jingan temple is just next door and if you don't mind the walking, you can choose to walk down to the Nanjing walking street and to the Bund, don't forget to bring along the camera you will find lots of nice scenery along the way. Of course, Taxi is cheap so can always hail one and happy riding! "
bailemen hotel ,"Good Value Hotel We stayed there for 3D/2N. The hotel was 1 to 2hr drive (depending on the traffic) from the new terminal 3 airport. 5-10 min walk to the subway. 5-10 walk to a mall and burger king. The bed was not that soft though. We had a deluxe room. It was big. No english channels e.g. CNN, BBC, HBO, etc. The Chinese buffet breakfast was ok. Didn't speak that much with the reception so I had no problem communicating with them. Money exchange rate at the hotel was good.Near a good bar/restaurant called the Spot which has some bands playing. Also near to an Irish pub. "
bailemen hotel ,"For budget travellers The location almost on top of metro station is good. The traffic on the streets are quite hard, continueing all thru the night. View is guite good, at least if your room is by the street.The staff does not speak very good English, but you can manage.Breakfast is not very good. Only few &quot;western&quot; items available. Tea is from teabags, but if you like strong coffee, you really enjoy the breakfast.Internet connection is quite expensive if you consider the price of the room, 40RMB per day.All in all, quite cheap, quite clean, quite ok. Just don't expect five star luxury and service. "
bailemen hotel ,"Great Location - but nothing else We booked this hotel based on the reviews on TA, agree that the location is great. However had not realised that a 3* hotel in China does not measure up to those in Europe and felt that the place was dingy, the food was awful and instead of staying the 3 nights booked we checked out after 1 night. Perhaps I was put off by the fact that condoms were on sale in the en-suite, must say that was a first for me. On the whole our other hotels in both Beijing and Xi'an were great but both were 4* and all were from this site. "
bailemen hotel ,"Great Location Excellent location for a hotel in Shanghai, as recommended by ELLYSE. Subway stop literally on the corner. Bookstores, food shops around the block. Near the hotel, a 24 hour convenience store + a McDonalds + a Shanghai restaurant was still open when we arrived at 1am. Rooms were ok, clean enough. But the location is everything in this case. Airport shuttle buses from both hongqiao and pudong have stops here. We paid only 19 rmb and 4rmb from both airports one way using the shuttle bus.Will consider this next time we stay in Shanghai. "
bailemen hotel ,"Review Location is great as there is a train station call jing an stn nearby. there is also a tourist information center just opposite the street of the hotel , the room was big , ( ours were the normal two bed ) and thus plenty of space to throw things around , there is even a safe depost in each room but you could also opt to put your valuables at the lobby .. there are shops nearby to the hotel and food is not a problem in fact the food there is consider cheap and we spend most of the money on food Dislike The food at the hotel was not that good , we took our breakfast at the hotel and after two days , we could not endure it and thus went out to eat the lobby service SUCKS big time , don't expect any smile or greetings from them. on the whole it was not bad if the service was good , then this hotel would get a better rating. "
bailemen hotel ,"amaizng location Stayed here for 5 nights. its a great location at a great price. between 40-50 US$.Rooms are huge, bigger than the JC Mandarin where I stayed before and payed about 120US$ a night.Excellent location with the Jignan temple right there and the Jignan tube station. full of restaurants, bars and shopping malls,.very accessible and even if you have forgotten your hotel address card, all you need to say is Jignan temple and you will be back here.On the flip side they hardly speak English so ordering anything is a bit cumbersome,but all in all the best value you can get and great location "
bailemen hotel ,"Perfect location great value hotel We just returned from a trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Bailemen for 4 nights. The staff were professional and willing to help at any hour. The location is spectacular for those who love a neighborhood feel. The Jianan Temple is across the street and the Jianan Park is also across the street. The hotel windows overlook the beautiful park where one can see the locals getting their morning exercise at dawn.Cheap yet trendy restaurants are all within one to two blocks and Nanjing Road- the artery of Shanghai's commercial and shopping district starts at the Bailemen and ends at the Bund. The few kilometers of walking helps one truly appreciate the upper end of Shanghai life.The rates for walk-ins is cheaper than what we paid. A triple room was advertised on the &quot;discount&quot; board for under $45. The exchange rate for currency was the same as banks and very convenient.Rooms are simple but comfortable. The breakfast is Chinese in general but does include toast, sweet rolls and eggs. My 9 year old did love eating the noodles and fried chicken as well as the abundant fresh fruit for breakfast which were part of the Chinese breakfast.The store next door is a nice grocery and convenience eatery where we picked up bottled water every day for about 20 cents a bottle.If you are looking for a clean, well-run hotel with good service and value for your money, you won't be disappointed. "
bailemen hotel ,"Tired Three Star Stayed at this hotel for three nights. It is rated three star according to the local system and you can expect a level of service and appointment no more than this. Patronised mainly by Chinese are far as we could tell. We found it to be a bit tired with decore in need of refurbishment. The bed was very hard, the TV channels were all in Chinese except one in English and no BBC or CNN. The breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was a Chinese buffet and some of the dishes might not suit Western tastes. Bread, jam, butter, omlette and soft drinks were all Westerners might find suitable for breakfast although dumplings and noodles were also available. Coffee was of a quality Westerners might not find acceptable. On the positive side it was very handily located on West Najing Road. A subway station was across the road as was a Japanese department store with food hall, supermarket, pharmacy, cafes and pizza restaurants. "

barony wanyuan hotel ,"Excellent value no frills! Location of hotel is quite good for crossing over by taxi to Puxi or going to Lujiajui. Unfortunately, its ambience and accessibility is somewhat spoilt by ongoing Metro construction work on Pudong Avenue. Neighbourhood is a little dusty but not unduly noisy. Room offers good size and comfort, without any unnecessary features or over-intrusive service. Another plus is the convenience of dining at the 2 wonderful Chinese restaurants on either side of the Pudong Avenue entrance. One is a popular Sichuan restaurant; the other a newly opened &quot;Fusion&quot; place featuring interesting dishes like Foie Gras done Chinese-style and Prime Mutton sourced from Hainan. "
barony wanyuan hotel ,"Good Value for the room The room was good. It was large with a nice sitting area. Our room came with a kitchen that was good size for a hotel room. This made it very nice for us to store food we purchased at the store. The shower was very nice, but a little small for our personal taste. The bathroom needs more lighting. The walls in the bedroom were dirty, but the rest of the area was clean. I would stay at this hotel again, because the price was such a good value. "
barony wanyuan hotel ,"Nice place I stay here whenever I come to Shanghai. It is close to our company's Shanghai office. The employees at the front desk can speak English (minimal though). The rooms are spacious and clean with a mini fridge that has water/coke/juice. The restaurant on the second floor serves breakfast with some westernized items. Although I thought that the french fries were a little weird for breakfast! They have a really nice selection of fruit, I made the mistake of loading up on it only to find out that it tasted salty (not sure why).They also have 4 or 5 English channels on their tv's which is nice.I would definitely recommend this hotel.The only thing I don't like is that most taxi drivers are not familiar with it so make sure you have the address in Chinese. "
barony wanyuan hotel ,"Decent place I stayed at the The Barony during a round trip in China. The booking was done by the chinese agency, so I can’t comment on the room rates.First I was a bit worried because I know Shanghai from former visits, though the hotel name was new to me. When I saw the tiny lobby, I got some more reservation and the english language skills of the front desk officers seemed to be minimal.On the other hand, the rooms are fairly big and very clean, also the bathroom. The view to Pudong is great. The door gives an alarm if not properly locked. Breakfast buffet was quite good, I think I had the best croissants all over China in that hotel. On those 4 days, I also had dinner in the restaurant at the last day. To order it took a while due to language barriers, but the restaurant staff was being very helpful and eager to feel us comfortable ... a kind of charming trouble, I don’t mind. By the way, the chinese meal was good value and quality.There’s another restaurant with a nice ambiance and decoration in the same building but with separate entrance from the road. The Metro station is just 5mins walk though you need to change trains if you’re heading for Nanjing or Huaihai Road.Get a business card with the hotels address, because taxi drivers are not familiar with the hotel. "
barony wanyuan hotel ,"One night only We only stayed one night at the Barony hotel because the Purple Mountain was fully booked. It is a very modern hotel. We would stay there again for one night only.The rooms were fairly large,clean and the bed very comfortable.The breakfast was not to my liking, cold fried eggs or Congee ( rice porridge) I just ate the fruit which was ok.

best western shanghai ruite hotel ,"Good Value Hotel but ... We just returned from Shanghai and our stay at the BestWestern Ruite.We agree with previous reviews that the hotel is a bit out of the way, and there is no eateries near by except for the restaurant within the hotel itself. Having said that, the new subway line (only a block away) is now open. This made it very easy to get to other parts of Shanghai. Depending on where you are heading, you may need to make 1 or 2 transfers though. To get to Pudong or the Bund, it would take 2 transfers and approximately 30-40 minutes.As for the restaurant in the hotel, they served surprisingly good meals. For example, the beef soup noodle was generous, tasty, and reasonable by western standard - this, coming from Chinese Canadians who are accustom to good meals.As for the hotel itself, the lobby looked a little dated, but our room looked more up to date. Make sure you book and ask for the &quot;business&quot; rooms.The bathroom was a good size with a tub. Air conditioning worked great. The bed was on the hard side, but I didn't mind that. Internet was free but was on the slow side. Breakfast, not bad, was also included.We arrived via Pudong International Airport, which is a good 60 minute taxi ride through heavy traffic. We left via Hongqiao International Airport for Beijing. This ride is only at most 20 minutes ride from the hotel.I booked the hotel using my travel points. So I guess it was good value - if you don't mind the location. "
best western shanghai ruite hotel ,"Interesting experience I have just returned from Shanghai BW hotel. It was really a good hotel with reasonable price. Room was clean and comfortable, however the bed was so hard. They welcomed really kindly. There were couple of issues there: they were not speaking english very well, so sometimes the communication was confusing. Breakfast is about 58 RMB, which is really expensive I think, and there is no too much options.Hotel is located in the southwest of Shanghai, out of the main attractions. You can use taxi to the Indoor Stadium metro station - approx. 15-20 min and max 18-20 RMB the cost. With the metro you can reach every attractions and the cost is about 4 RMB.Ask the receptions every time for a taxi card where they can write your destination in Chinese.It is really important, because almost nobody speaking english. "
best western shanghai ruite hotel ,"great hotel I stayed at this hotel in Nov 2007 as it was recommended to me by the Tennis Masters Cup ticket agents in Shanghai. I was told that it was one of the hotels near the Qi Zhong tennis centre.The only negative aspect of this hotel is that it is in the middle of the HongQiao industrial zone!!! To get to anywhere near ( subway, shops etc) you need to take a taxi and it was no where near the tennis center. I ended taking a taxi there the first 2 days ( 30-45 min trip, depending on traffic ,60 - 70 RNMB one way) and then took the shuttles to and from the pick-up points around Shanghai once I got my bearings. I was told by the managment team that there will be a subway station 2 minutes' walk form the hotel byt the end of this year.Otherwise, I had no complaints about this hotel. Great hotel, clean, large, modern rooms. It is also part of some art initiative and so there are pieces of modern art scultpures, paintings, displays all over the hotel. Hotel is sophisticated and well decorated. All rooms have either wifi, internet access, cable tv. Breakfast was both continental and Chinese. There is a full service restaurant there as well specialising in Chinese and Italian cuisine- not very expensive. Staff very friendly and helpful, esp for translating destinations to taxi drivers in chinese. Beware that the average person in Shanghai speaks very little english but the young people are speaking more English now. It is a good idea to learn a few phrases in Mandarin.I would definitely stay there again once the subway station has been completed to make it easier to get into central Shanghai.Arrived at Pudong intl and took the line 3 bus at the airport to the Yin He ( Galaxy) hotel then took a taxi from there to the hotel. Hotel is definitely nearer Hong Qiao airport and taxi there cost about 45 RNMB. I checked out one day after I arrived as I had to fly to Beijing for 2 days and my luggage was stored and I was upgraded to a bigger room/ business room when I returned to check in the 2nd time around.All in all , great , modern, classy hotel best suited for businessmen who have come to do business in the hundreds of factories in the area. Very quiet and all rooks sound-proofed. Having said that, there were many tourists at hotel as well. Shanghai is a great city and will definitely visit again.Enjoy the stay and , by the way, the pics of the hotel are accurate.If anyone wants to contact me about the tennis masters cup , feel free.

broadway mansions hotel ,"Reasonably priced 5star The Broadway Mansions in Shanghai was built in 1934 and has recently been refurbished in modern Art Deco style. Situated close to The Bund and within walking distance of Nanjing Pedestrian Street. What a pleasant experience after our disaster at The Bund Riverside Hotel. Here everything was spotless and state of the art. Rooms were well equiped with amenities. The TV is also a PC in your room.There is a minimal charge to use the internet. Tea and coffee facilities are available and the utensils are packed very neatly into specifically designed draws. Iron and ironing board stored in the wardrobe as is the room safe. The service was impecable and the staff well versed in English and other languages. When there was need for service in the room, someone was there almost immediately. No swiming pool but a very good exercise facility and spa/beauty parlour. Quality control was high on the agenda. The Breakfast room overlooks The Bund and the choice of food was quite extensive and suitable for all tastes. This hotel, in my opinion is a &quot;Hidden Gem&quot; "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Most enjoyable stay! We stayed at the Broadway for 5 nights and honestly I must say this was one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. All the staff spoke English, they were always friendly and polite and very helpful. They called the airline to confirm our flight when we checked out. They wrote our sightseeing destinations in Chinese for us and told us approx. how much the taxi ride would cost. No detail was spared. The rooms were impeccable, they thought of everything from the fluffy bathrobes to a flashlight plus the desk drawer had every international voltage plug so we could recharge our camera battery plus our laptop.The only downside was the construction on the Bund, just made the walk to Nanjing Rd a few minutes more. Room service was delivered quick - less than 15 minutes! The delivery boy was very appreciative when I gave him a tip. The price for this hotel would be way more than what we paid for come 2010. I would definitely recommend this hotel. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Cool hotel TERRIBLE construction site (at least until 2010) Like: - prime locaton on the famous bund street (though during my stay, the city is renovating the bund for 2010 SH Exhibition event, making ALL hotels on/around bund a huge construction site)- well-preserved old-time charm- solid isolation, i mean sound proof: we stayed on 7th floor, construciotn outside went on 24hrs, when we opened the window, it was insupportable, but once we closed the window, we heared nothing...- very confortable bed- great, great view (Please, DO book a room with the river view, otherwise why pay the price staying on bund, facing the ugly street view???)Hate: - the fact that there is practically no bund life until 2010 - OMG, the so-called continental breakfast, which they charge $20/ per person, was a scandal: warm orange juice, cold/ stale cafe, unfresh meat...go out to any bistro in SH you can have excellent food for half the price- smell: a vague but strong smell of kitchen or garbage in the lobby and the stairs, making me doubt the hygiene of the hotel, despite the almost impeccably roomConclusion: still the best deal on bund street with river view and old-time charm. just wait until 2010 event (the price will be tripled though...)- "
broadway mansions hotel ,"A very pleasant and comfortable hotel with excellent service We stayed at the Broadway Mansions June 30, July 1, July 2, July 21 and July 22, 2009. Not only were we pleased with the overall service but the breakfast was superb. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and they were eager to please their guests. I was happy with the hotel and I would return again. I have stayed at several similar hotels in Shanghai and this was the best. It is a short walk to the Bund (under construction for the 2010 Expo) and Nanjing Road. Taxis were easy to find and the hotel has a beautiful view of the Huangpu river and night lights. I had a coke at the bar and I thought it was excessively priced, but not any more than other hotel bars. If you happen to dislike your room, just ask and the staff will asccommodate you. I was dissappointed because the hotel charges for internet but many hotels in Shanghai do the same. Considering the convenient location and the quality of the room, I think it is one of the best for the money. Charles and Gloria Juedemann, Union, Missouri USA "
broadway mansions hotel ,OK- but needs to review standards Hotel is close to start of Bund- a 11 CYN taxi or 10 min walk to closest Subway stop on Line 2 Nanjing East. Staff was nice. Room clean and reasonable size. Problem was TV and Air did not work properly 1st night. Went and called the frount desk 3 times. It was the maid in the hallway that got someone to come and fix the problem. Breakfast is OK- about 128CYN or 18US. Internet is expensive. Hotel needs to make sure staff checks out rooms before putting a guest in one. Bellmen and all staff are above average. 
broadway mansions hotel ,Comfortable and well priced I recently stayed at Broadway Mansions hotel for 5 nights. The room was clean and comfortable and the view was stunning. The staff were friendly and spoke enough English to understand. The hotel is a little isolated and you should be prepared to walk to the main tourist areas ( 10-15 minutes ) . Even when taking a cab be prepared to endure awful traffic jams ( but that is the case at most hotels around the Bund). I never had the breakfast but there is a great Japanese restaurant on premises which was ideal for business lunches. Overall for around $120 /night its a great deal ! 
broadway mansions hotel ,"Recently renovated and excellent value ! Stayed October 11-20, 2008 in Room 811 with views of Souzhou Creek and Huangpu River. Very clean and comfortable room with plasma TV and large modern bathroom with tub and walk-in shower.Excellent buffet breakfast selections. Very pleasant and helpful staff. All in all, I can emphatically recommend this hotel! "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Nice Hotel Our room was on the 15th floor, facing the Bund. The view was awesome. There is a construction right in front of the hotel, so if you need to take a nap during the day, it’s very noisy. The breakfast was not included, so we had breakfast outside of the hotel. The hotel bar is very expensive comparing to the other hotels that we stayed during our China trip. If you are looking to have a great view of the Bund and the river, it’s a great hotel to stay. But if you don’t care, you can find a better place to stay. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Appalling Service Iffy location Get used to the staff of such an outwardly upscale hotel laughing at you -- as you ask for directions or to make a dinner reservation. They do *not* speak English proficiently and out of embarrassment (?) will often giggle. Avoid the concierge service as much as possible, we were frequently given wrong information.The location would be ok, but the hotel is currently cut off from the Bund (there used to be a pedestrian bridge), so you are obliged to take taxis just about anywhere. They are doing construction work below, so expect some re-shuffling of rooms if they give you anything below the 13th floor. Service is thoughtlessly bad -- cleaning women come round late after noon (and will open the room door, even if you're in it) to give you absurd gifts (cheap little pouches), the breakfast staff will forget about coffee refills while whisking any plate you finish while you're still chewing. A real disappointment. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Just a passable hotel service is low quality I and a group of colleagues stayed there for 5 nights and we were disappointed. The rooms are good and clean. I stayed on the Executive floor, facing the Bund with an amazing view. The noise for the works on the bridge were not a problem since they stopped working during the night. The main problems were with the service. The staff at the concierge speak a very limited English and if you have requests that are not the usual &quot;please write the address of the fabric market in Chinese for the taxi driver&quot; they will have troubles understanding. In 2 occasions they gave the wrong address to the taxi driver and, in general, they seem not willing to help.In two occasions the room service entered the room despite the 'do not disturb' sign on the door. The minibar was not refurbished after use.At night we also saw pimps in front of the hotel. One guest of the hotel spit in the lobby and the staff didn't complain or anything. Overall, we don't recommend it. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"An encouraging mixture We stayed in the Broadway Mansion Hotel for four nights in early May, having been booked there by a Chinese Travel Agent whom we know and trust implicitly.The hotel is a striking, solid block in a dominant position overlooking the Bund, and also the building site where the new Bund bridge is being constructed. That said, the noise was never apparent although the detour to pick up the side of the river was unfortunate.The rooms were as one might expect, comfortable and well-maintained. That said, we were moved and up-graded after the first night, because our room was to be 'refurbished', and moved and up-graded again after the second night because of the strong smell of solvent in the corridor from the adjacent, in-house rebuilding. And the third room was just fine!The staff were exceedingly helpful and welcoming.Would I stay there again - yes, and in the hope that the internal and external building work had at last been finished. With that, it is certainly one of the very best positioned hotels in Shanghai. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Enjoyed stay at the Broadway Mansions Hotel I stayed at this hotel for three nights at the end of march 2008. My room was on one of the upper floors, facing the Bund in an executive suite. The view was great and produced some amazing photos. Unfortunately direct access to the Bund was restricted because they are currently working on the bridge. To get to the Bund pedestrians had to walk about a 8min detour across a bridge further along the creek.Internet access in the Business Centre was on the expensive side.Rooms were made up expertly each day and bathroom amenities were refilled.Beds were extremely comfortable in comparison to the norm of hard beds in China.The restaurants were all great. The service was impeccable at the Chinese retaurant on level 2 as well as in the Lobby Cafe. I enjoyed a few wines in the lobby cafe on Friday night whilst waiting for it to get dark and the city lights to come on. It should be noted that during the week nights the city lights do not all come on for power saving effort. The floor to ceiling windows here make it easy to people watch and see the traffic and bicycles go by. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Still under renovation 2-3 star hotel with 5 star view (if you can get it) I stayed at this hotel in mid-October 2007 on one of the upper floors, facing the Bund in an executive suite. The view was really great and is the hotel's best feature. The next best feature is the location if you plan to hang around the Bund for most of your stay. We didn't and so it became an issue later as we had to fight the traffic to and from our hotel to get to other parts of the city. The biggest issue is that the hotel is still under renovation so if you get a room on one of the floors being renovated you can expect noise, smells (some fairly foul, maybe from toilets being replaced?) and workers walking around and leaving their equipment in the hallways. In our case, to get to our room we had to walk on drop cloths, past ladders, unfinished rooms and step over a bucket of dirty water that was inexplicably left in front of our door for three days. I purposely didn't call the front desk about it to see if the workers, or even the cleaning staff would take the initiative to remove it. They didn't. Only one elevator worked which was a problem during busy check-in and check-out times.The second biggest issue is that the hotel doesn't get the details right, and they add up. Our suite was nice, but not great. The bathroom was clean and functional, but the towels were several years too old (fraying at the edges). Little annoyances added up. Electrical switches were mislabeled and plugs were in inconvenient locations (I had to charge my cell phone in the hall for example), the room safe was not bolted down, the new wallpaper was peeling in places, the carpet looked old already, the computer in the room was very dusty and not plugged in, large paint splashes were in several places and all windows had numbers marked on them, probably from construction notes. I didn't see a single glass / metal surface cleaned properly. The elevator was always dirty. I felt that the cleaning staff was simply moving dirt around, not really cleaning.The daily breakfast was fine, although I think the staff was still trying to figure things out. Internet access was available only at an extra charge. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful.My advice to travelers is to wait until the renovation is over unless you get a really good deal on a room facing the Bund on a floor that's not being renovated. Even then, don't expect a luxury hotel as this hotel simply doesn't get the details right. It's more of a two-three star hotel with a five star view. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Broadway Mansions just fine for us My husband and I stayed at Broadway Mansions in Sept 2007 (booked through Haystack ) as a stopover on our way home to Oz from Europe and our experience was a very good one. The hotel was undergoing renovation but we were upgraded to an executive room at no extra cost and it was obviously one that had just been newly renovated. It was huge with a separate room with big desk with own computer - such a luxury as we hadn't had this anywhere in Europe. The bathroom was spotless and also obviously brand new. We didn't check out the gym or spa but we did find the hotel to be fantastically well located right on the Bund and we also found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Also, we didn't check out the restaurant (except for breakfast which was ok)as you were spoilt for choice anyway on the Bund with eating options.Sure, there was a bit of noise and dust because of the renovation and yes one of the lifts wasn't working but this didn't really matter to us and we thought our $137.73 AUD cost for the night was fantastic value after what we had had in Europe. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"stay at broadway mansion at your own risk! If you like cockroaches, filthy black carpets, non working elevators, rooms that smell of paint fumes and chemicals, this is the place for you. Though travelocity advertises this hotel as a 4star, when I arrived it was under construction. Hallway carpets were missing or black with dirt; only one elevator worked. the dining area and the rooms all reeked of toxic chemicals and they had the nerve to charge full price. If you stay here, you have been warned!!!!!!!! "
broadway mansions hotel ,"AChinese Experience. The Broadway Mansions Hotel is also known as the Shanghai Mansions which causes some confusion with taxi drivers! We stayed in a twin room in this hotel from 19th to 25th June 2007. We were looking forward to the promised and much publicised view of the river, boats etc. Instead we looked down on some very dingy buildings.Our room was large – as was the bathroom. The latter contained both bath and shower – shame that the shower cubicle didn’t have frosted glass and that the water leaked over the bathroom floor each time the shower was used. The bar of soap provided at the commencement of our stay became disgustingly soggy as time went on. Other complementary toiletries were replaced daily – including comb, shower cap, toothbrush and toothpaste. We were able to borrow a multiplug adaptor from the hotel.As other reviews have stated – the beds were very firm, but we really liked them and slept well until the hammering and banging from the construction of the new lobby woke us at 6am each morning. There is an in- room safe – in the bottom of the wardrobe at floor level. Ours was locked when we arrived but a handyman was able to open it for us – we did wonder how secure it really was after that experience. We asked for – and received - a very small and very wonky ironing board. I managed to level it by putting one of the legs inside a shoe!! We were left two sealed bottles of drinking water daily and this was extremely useful and much appreciated. There was also a jug of drinking water in the room – we passed on that one!The carpet was dirty but the rest of the room was of average cleanliness. The maid did her work extremely quickly and the floor was definitely not cleaned daily. There was quite a sophisticated lighting system which illuminated a ‘Do not Disturb’ light outside the door. Housekeeping still knocked the door even if that sign was on.Despite ‘coffee and tea making facilities’ being advertised, we were only ever left three kinds of tea bags – no sugar, no creamer and no coffee. The promised fresh fruit was delivered only on the first day of our stay.The doormen were excellent (and patient) in obtaining taxis for us, but the reception staff twice wrote our destination down incorrectly - costing us extra in both taxi fares and time. Being in a taxi with a driver who speaks no English and who has been given a card with the wrong information on it is extremely stressful and knowing that the taxi is taking you a long way from your intended destination creates anxiety. The sauna was non-existent, the fitness centre a joke. No Internet access was available within the hotel unless you had your own computer. We also did not find a business centre. The concierge was rarely to be found.The nearest Metro Station was too far away from this hotel for convenience. Reception staff was polite and businesslike but their language skills were extremely varied. Some of them were interested in helping us – others were indifferent.We booked the Airport shuttle – it looked very nice on the illustration in the temporary lobby – reality was somewhat different!! However it got us to the airport and out of a hotel we will never use again. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Landmark hotel with its own style This is a solid mid-range hotel with all the facilities one can expect in that category. I was staying there in March 2007 and the room I had was spacious, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely fork out again for the river-view suite - the views are possibly the best one can have in Shanghai, overlooking both the colonial Bund and futuristic Pudong - at night it looks fantastic, and by day it's equally impressive. Without a river-facing suite, one can still enjoy the views from an 18th floor viewing balcony. The rooms have internet access, TV, minibar etc. - all the usual stuff.The hotel has character and its own style, which may or may not be to everyone's taste. Travellers expecting international chain hotel atmosphere shouldn't come here. Breakfast buffet (both Western style and Chinese) is good, but for dinner, avoid the hotel's eateries and head for much better (and/or cheaper) places elsewhere. In particular avoid the 'Western-style' menu in the otherwise cosy ground floor cafe/bar/restaurant - it's awful. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful, even if their English language abilities varies. A range of day trips can be booked through the hotel. Other on-site services include a rather dingy sauna (better avoid), an OK gym, and Chinese massage. There is also a basement night-time only karaoke bar, which seems to cater in particular to Japanese and other Asian single male business travellers. BM is a landmark art deco building from the 1930s, and has featured in Shanghai's turbulent history. For tourist purposes, it's ideally located, minutes walk away from the Bund, and East Nanjing Road (the main shopping street). Taxis are cheap and always plentiful outside the hotel. Being surrounded by busy roads though, the hotel is not exactly in a quiet corner of Shanghai, and building site noise (which is difficult to escape anywhere in Shanghai) is also likely to impact on guests who might want to sleep or rest during the day.On the whole I would recommend BW to any active traveller who is looking for a bit of local flavour in their accommodation, but won't use the hotel too much apart from it being a convenient base to explore this truly exciting city. The history, views, and location makes this hotel above average for me, though for some visitors the amenities might result in a lower rating. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Broadway Mansion hotel .. Stayed there for 3 nights feb20-23 as part of tour group. Very old hotel. Every room is different. Some rooms are reasonable, some not. Most room has Safe. No iron, small bathroom, old system with complicated light switches. Not as clean. Cannot move twin bed together. Can open windows.Internet at business center, limited hours. Cost 6 Yuan for 5 minutes. (7.6 Yuan per 1 US dollar)Breakfast on second floor, okay but not great..some food are cold. some fruit, french toast, eggs to order, limited supply.Good location. Only about 10 minutes walk to Nanjing Road where all the shoppings and activities are. 5 minutes to Bund. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Nice hotel - but very hard beds The good: pretty good location and nice breakfast buffet (American or Chinese). The doormen are great (can hail you a taxi) and will confirm with driver your destination. The front desk has cards that state in English and Chinese &quot;Take me to __&quot; and they will fill in the Chinese for you. Everyone seemed to speak very good English. The hotel has English HBO and Cinimax. Room was very large with teriffic and newly remodeled shower/bathroom. But beware, every room was somewhat different when we compared them to others. Had post office and business center in hotel, as well as very pushy sales staff in attached gift shop.The bad: the ROCK HARD BEDS!!! The floor was softer than these beds. I have never slept on a brick bed before staying here. The others in our tour group all had the same complaint. Because I primarily use the hotel room for sleeping, I had to rate this hotel only 3 stars, even though it was great that they all spoke English and were very helpful.Although they had fast Internet, they charged $20 US a day or $1 a minute to use, which I thought was high.The food store in hotel was extremely high ($3.00 for a Coke that you could buy for .50 on street) but I guess that is to be expected at hotel.Bottom line, if part of an included tour group, not so bad. But if paying on own or going on business, the beds are just too hard and you could stay at better for the same price. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Overrated a bit drabby internet not working. The location is very good but the room is definitely not 4 star, more like 3 stars. The shower wouldn't drain but they got that fixed pretty quickly. The room is drabby and dirty and the sheets and towels are not changed regulary. In our room, the internet wasn't working when we checked in. After advising numerous staff (5 in total over a few days), it still wasn't fixed. We complained and then on our last and fifth day, they finally allowed us to use the Business Centre internet for free. The communication between staff in the hotel is very poor. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"A Study in indifference Hotel is conveniently located to the Bund and the rooms are large. After that it runs down hill quite rapidly. The desk just couldn't seem to get the names right on the room so it took about 20 minutes of discussion to get it 2/3 right. The Chinese restaurant staff was competent. The &quot;Western&quot; restaurant staff could walk right at you and never notice 6 people waving. The buffett dishes were only taken up after we left. We know this happened because they weren't there the next morning. The Cafe staff were somewhat quicker on the uptake. They smiled only when the bill was paid. 20 minutes for a morning cup of coffee with 2 patrons, 1 bartender and a waitress? Yep. 20 minutes. Nice price, but sans breakfast coupon and given the service somewhere else is probably a good idea. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Frustrated with my stay I recently stayed with two other people for three nights at B'way Mansions and was r. disappointed. I had no idea the hotel is actively renovating rooms. There was no mention on the hotel website, nor was anything mentioned when I emailed to confirm nor when we checked in. We were informed by a small laminated notice on the desk in the room that construction had begun in December 2005 and would be going on daily until 6 pm. On our first morning there was only a dull buzz and a vague chemical smell before we left for the day. However, on the second morning, there clearly was the sound of construction going on above our room and an incredibly strong toxic, glue smell that permeated the entire suite. My other frustration was that after having initially made the reservation for the Deluxe Bund Suite which includes a king-size bed, I decided I wanted to be certain to get one of the newly renovated rooms and to change the reservation to 2 double beds. I had a Mandarin-speaking friend contact the hotel directly from the US and change the reservation. However, when we arrived at the hotel there was no room with 2 double beds available and the manager offered us an &quot;upgrade&quot; to a suite, assuring us that it was one of the renovated rooms. What we actually got was what we had initially reserved--there was no upgrade! At first I thought the manager had also lied about the room being one that was renovated--it looked nothing like the pictures on the Expedia website--but then we read in one of our travel guides that some rooms in the hotel underwent renovation several years ago. It is ridiculous and deceptive for the hotel to be calling those rooms renovated at this point especially when they are currently doing further work on other rooms!There were other small frustrations but nothing I would not expect at a hotel of this grade. The concerns I have elaborated above, however, are not due to the class of the hotel but to a general lack of consideration for patrons. On the up side, the room was clean and the view was excellent. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Should close while under construction The hotel was under construction. The smell and pounding was evident throughout. We moved twice. Our last room was next door to a curtained off area that was being rehabbed, but atleast they weren't painting and staining any wood in the immediate area. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were well scrubbed. The atmosphere was hurt by the disruptions going on throughout the building. I would advise that one hold off on reserving at this hotel until the improvements are completed, which by the size of the building, could be quite a while from now. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Good hotel This hotel was a nice suprise. The hotel didn't look very nice from the outside, but the inside makes up for it. The staff was very friendly although their english skills could have been better. But they were really helpful in every way. The rooms were above average, we had 2 twin beds, but as they were so big we only used one. The bathroom was also very nice. I should mention, we had a superiour room....There were som construction work taking place on our floor, but as they worked from around 08 to around 6 pm it didn't bother us at all.We didn't try the breakfast as the price were quite stiff; 118 Yuan for the buffet. Instead we went to &quot;Manabe&quot; down on the bund for western sandwiches with coffee.The location was good too. A taxi to the xiangchang market (fake brands etc.) costs about 15 Yuan. The bund was just over the bridge, althought the bund is overrated in my opinion. Nothing much to see, just busy with tourists.We were very pleased with the hotel in overall, and we would stay there again when we return to Shanghai :) "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Nice Surprise! If you are looking for Western service and amenities, this may not be the place, but if you are looking for a great location, great view, and a bit of old-world Shanghai, this is a great value. Accomodations more than adequate - spacious, high-ceilinged room (riverside - recommended for view; a bit noisy, but hey - it's Shanghai!) with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Restaurants a bit boring, but so much within walking distance it is irrelevant. I loved that I could fling open the windows and overlook the Bund, the river and Pudong across! Very colorful!!Recommended! "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Average Hotel But Love the View Overall, an average hotel with friendly staff. The view from the river front rooms are great. Excellent view of the Bund and Pudong.We had an Executive Room facing the river, which was rather dated. However, it was very spacious. The bathroom was clean but need a makeover. The beds are little hard but it is a common problem in China.But for the rate that we paid approx AUD $145, it is fairly good value. It is situated very close to the Bund but a fair walk to the Metro. "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Great location nice room friendly staff! Stayed there for 4 nights. The new decorated deluxe room was furbished and decorated in the best of taste. Small but very clean. Don't know if the standard rooms are as nice. the staff was very friendly and helpful. Very favourable price compared to good standard and fantastic location of hotel. The building is old, but in very good condition and everything is clean. The buffet breakfast is not very good (poor choice and expensive), better take your breakfast à la carte at the coffee shop (opened 24 h). Would choose this hotel again! "
broadway mansions hotel ,"Old-style Shanghai This is one of the old shanghai hotels with a lot of history and a lot of character. The staff were very pleasant and helpful in everyway possible. The location was also excellent, with some stunning views of the Pudong and the Bund. I stayed here twice, and on both occasions I was able to persuade the staff to upgrade me to a suite. The suites were very nice, spacious and well furnished. Ok ok, maybe I have the luck of the Irish with an irish passport but I got it twice so I would recommend others to try. All in all a very good standard hotel with a lot of character and charm. "

Large, marble bathroom with the only shortcoming, both the bath and shower were combined. Loads of room to stretch out, flat screen TV, firm but comfortable bed, large well appointed working desk, smart and restful decor and large floor to ceiling windows with arguably the best block out curtains I have come across.This hotel really is central; close to all the action on Najing Road, about a 10 minute walk to the Bund, a few minutes to the subway and all the shopping you could want either on Nanjing Road out the front or the 24 hour market out the back door.Stakk had limited English, but were always polite and as helpful as circumstances allowed.The buffet breakfaqst was great, with eggs cooked to order and complimentary English Newspapers. "
central hotel shanghai ,"location plus everything you'd expect of a good city centre hotel You arrive here to a truly sumptuous reception area and the service given is no let down. Your luggage is handled by the bell boy’s from the moment your car pulls up outside and is quietly and efficiently delivered to your room. The room is spacious clean well equipped with a tv and internet access should you need it. There is also a large spa on one floor and a business centre on another. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and offers an excellent choice for buffet breakfast. The service here however is better on a weekday than the weekend when you really do have to attract the staff’s attention for coffee and tea and tables are not cleared after guests have left them. Not the 5* service that people have said it is, a good 3 or 4* at best. Selected primarily for its central location you just cross a road and you are approx 100mtrs from the Nanjing Road shopping area and 20mins walk to the Bund so for location its great. Restaurants and bars on the Nanjing road tend to be expensive. However if you turn right as you exit the Hotel foyer, cross the road and walk for 100mtrs you will find a small restaurant, ‘Billy Brothers’, which offers very good food at reasonable prices. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Nice room horrid bed We were pleased with this hotel. Perfect location. We had a room on the end. I definitely recommend the &quot;curved&quot; rooms as my parents had a regular square room that wasn't as nice (yet bigger). The curved room had an entire wall of window, which I really loved. I will say that the rooms are clean and up-to-date. However, we both have to get our backs adjusted from the bed. I could feel the springs through the mattress. It was pretty bad. They charge for everything - business center internet use, coffee packets, etc. I was a bit horrified by that. But the room really is pretty. I wouldn't likely stay here again unless I was on a budget. If they replaced the bed, I would definitely stay here again. Decent breakfast - not great. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Comfort location - and the best show in town! Shanghai acrobats, step aside! Our window at the Central Hotel was the best show in town, looking down on Nanjing Lu pedestrian street and the nonstop activity in Century Plaza. The morning after the four of us checked in, my cousin woke up to some hundred-odd Chinese folks performing their morning exercises to boom boxes, including one lot doing martial arts drumming (see photo). What a neat welcome to China! We just had to go out for a stroll and enjoy the action every morning we were there, before taking advantage of the excellent Western, Chinese and Japanese breakfast buffet.So a word to international five-star hotel junkies (like me): If you can stand life without a rainforest shower, then save money and enjoy plenty of comfort in Shanghai's best tourist location, at the center of Nanjing Lu and a five minute walk from the Metro. The large, comfortable rooms have firm but comfortable beds, and lots of electric outlets, including at bedside tables, where light switches are also thoughtfully placed. Good bathrooms with standard shower in tub.For the best Nanjing Lu view, ask for a room ending in 03. Light sleepers may prefer a back room; the exercisers start a bit before 7 am. But personally, I loved the full view, with floor to ceiling windows and a convenient ledge to curl up on with throw pillows and a book, and watch Shanghai stroll by.The staff generally has excellent English and is helpful, although not always knowledgeable. The concierge desk is shared by gray-uniformed bellmen who will gamely try to answer questions, but you're better off with the black-suited real concierges.There is wired broadband in rooms at a greedy 80 RMB per 24 hours. Annoyingly, you can't sign up for more than one day at a time.The Chinese restaurant serves delicious food at reasonable prices; we recommend it highly (although the soups were dull). "
central hotel shanghai ,"Great Location Top Hotel My husband, daughter and I stayed for 4 nights and thought the room was lovely, very spacious and comfortable. Good sized bathroom and very helpful staff. Be prepared for the early wake up call from the exercisers and their music at 7am - we were on the 19th floor and could hear this clearly, as with the sound system in the square blaring out piano music for best part of the day!Over the road from Pedestrian Shopping street so very convenient. Staff were very professional and helpful.Only fault we could find was that the restaurant only had a buffet Salad bar for dinner and did not offer a full menu - breakfast was full and accommodated everyone.Taxis were easy to get and plenty of them - 44 yuan to Hongqiao Airport - cheap!Business Centre offered internet access but quite costly and we had to pay to use the Table Tennis table in the Gym, we thought using the gym and its facilities would be free. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Perfectly fine although not terribly memorable This is a very decent hotel, with a fabulous location. The rooms are clean and well-appointed, but nothing spectacular. I can't say there was anything that was really wrong with the hotel, but there were some small things that made it less than spectacular. For instance, the hair dryer in the room was barely room temperature and the bathrooms have generally seen better days. The concierge gave us incorrect information at least twice, and couldn't really recommend a local restaurant other than the ones in the hotel. We were supposed to have a non-smoking room, but it didn't really matter as people were smoking all over the hotel and the smell just lingers. Also, the Internet service is 80 rmb/day, which seemed pretty outrageous.On the upside, the location cannot be beat. It's walking distance to the Bund, People's Park, Nanjing Lu, and many restaurants. The service staff was generally very nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and varied. While the Asian selections were quite good, the Western options were so-so (runny eggs, soggy pancakes, very average pastries). "
central hotel shanghai ,"centrally lovated This hotel is right on the main shopping street, so very conveniently located. Metro stop is about 5 min walk.The room was clean and tidy, quite spacious.

central hotel shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel This hotel is an excellent hotel. I can think of nothing negative to say about it. Great staff, great food, great location. I am surprised at the ranking here as I had not checked before my stay, but it can only speak positively to excellent service being offered by hotels in Shanghai! "
central hotel shanghai ,"Great value and location We spent 3 nights at the Central in October based on the reviews that are on this site. I must say that I have not much to add it is well located the staff are very friendly as per all the rest of the reviews and the photos, on this site, which are very accurate.This is a Chinese and not Western run hotel so it has a slightly different feel from Sheratons etc.What I would like to add is that as a family with three young kids this hotel is unbeatable. They have family suites on the 8th floor (the hotel itself is about 30 floors) which are very comfortable. These rooms consist of a lounge with tv and toilet as well as two bedrooms both have the most wonderful bathrooms with seperate shower. The whole hotel including rooms has a new carpet except for, strangely these family suites?? Perhaps they figure kids will mess the new ones?Ultimately for $300 +tax ,for 5 of us including an above average breakfast and an extra bed it cannot be beaten.I made the reservation directly with Ricky the reservation manager who while a little slow to respond was fantastic.PROSUnbelievable rooms for familiesReasonable ratesReally really good locationClean well keptComfortable beds (we never found them to hard)Brilliant bathroom with free bottles of waterHelpful staffCONSOnly one, they need to replace carpets in family suites.

central hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel in great location We stayed for 3 nights here as part of a 3 week trip to China. This was our third trip to China and first to Shanghai. The hotel is virtually on Nanjing Road, a shoppers paradise, and is very good value. The hotel staff very friendly and helpful and the rooms, bed linen etc were spotless. The beds were harder than we are used to in the UK but we have found that nearly all beds in China tend to be quite hard. Despite the harder beds we slept well and enjoyed our stay at this hotel. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Sleepless in Shanghai This was our first stop in China and needless to say we did not sleep. The beds were rock hard which I almost expected but even with the endless blankets which the hotel put on top of the mattress it made little difference. The hotel had good facilities, we were advised it was five star but I would rate as a three to four. Had an iron and board in the room which was handy and a kettle. The room was a good size and had all the free toiletries and mini bar. Bit shocked when I went to buy a glass of milk to keep in the fridge for tea and was charged £3.50. Restaurant facilities were ok and breakfast had good choice. We were on the 13th floor which was far enough up not to hear the noise from the centre below. The hotel is extremely central, the title gives it away and excellent for accessing all the need to see things in Shanghai. Free umbrella hire available from concierge which was very handy as it rained a lot. Make sure you make it clear that you want a non smoking room as throughout our trip we were continously were given smoking rooms with the ash tray taken out. We had to go back to reception and explain that we wanted to be on the no smoking floor which most of the hotels did have. Overall a good place to stay. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Perfect location and great breakfast Stayed at the Central Hotel in late July 2008.Booked directly with the hotel via email. Staff was very helpful. Check-in and check-out procedures were very efficient. Location is perfect, within walking distance to both the Bund and People's Square. Having stayed on the northern edge of the Bund on my first trip to Shanghai, this time I chose a more central location. Had a room with a view to the large square in front of the hotel and Nanjing Street. It was great to watch the crowds move up and down the street and the locals starting Tai Chi from 6am.The room was spacious and clean.Breakfast buffet was great, with a large selection of both western style and Chinese dishes, and even some so-called Japanese style dishes, which looked more Portuguese style to me but were indeed delicious. Breakfast starts from 6am and that's great, especially after the first night when one is still jet-lagged or if one needs to go back the airport early.Air con was strong in the lobby but that was absolutely needed as the outside temperature was well over 35 deg C every day, and already over 32 deg at 8:30 am. So it felt great to reenter the hotel every time and cool out after hours of sweating through the streets of Shanghai.A number of very good bookstores can be found in Fuzhou Street just two blocks away.I will definitely consider staying there again on my next trip to Shanghai. "
central hotel shanghai ,"A Ggreat hotel experience The Central Hotel Shanghai is great value, well situated and provides very good service. We stayed here twice during a short visit to central China in early May 2008. It seems to cater to western and Chinese tour groups, business people and wedding parties, giving it a quite cosmopolitan and international feeling. English is widely spoken by staff.Rooms (we stayed in 1704 and 2005) are very well appointed, and laundry and housekeeping is of a very high standard. Beds are very comfortable, although mattresses may be a little harder than some western visitors are used to. Rooms are of a good size, although the window in 2005 was smaller due to the hotel facade's distinctive circular motif on the upper floors. Climate control of the room was perfect.The buffet breakfast provided in the &quot;coffee shop&quot; (its actually the hotel's main restaurant) is an excellent combination of western and Chinese food and also very good value, being included in our tariff. We found a feed here really set us up for the day. The same can't be said for the buffet dinner available after 5.00 pm for about 150RMB per head. This was quite dull and lacking in imagination by comparison - its hard to believe it came out of the same kitchen in this otherwise immaculate hotel. We were so disappointed that to avoid it on another night we ate at the Sofitel next door - an outstanding buffet at about 250RMB. Of course, the Nanjing Rd area has many very good restaurants. The Central Hotel also has a Chinese restaurant on the second floor which we did not eat at. There is a mini-supermarket on the first (ground) floor next to the business centre, and some quite good quality shops on level 2.The Central Hotel's location is undoubtedly one of its great attractions - walking distance to the Bund, the spectacular Shanghai Museum, and of course Nanjing Rd's many stores. We also walked 30 minutes to the Yu Yuan Gardens and braved the hard sell for pearls and jade in the surrounding market. It was only some time later that we discovered a much better jade and pearl market directly opposite the Central Hotel in Nanjing Rd (Shanghai Souvenir Market and Pearl City, next to Baleno and KFC).The Central Hotel is highly recommended and one of my best hotel experiences in China. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Central Hotel Shanghai The Central Hotel Shanghai, as its name suggests, is centrally located in PuXi, just a block off Nanjing Road and about 1/2 mile from the Bund. It's pretty much an ideal location. I arrived in the middle of a once-in-a-decade snowstorm and was soaked to the skin from sleet and snow. Disinclined to explore further for dinner, I changed clothes and headed to one of the hotel's two restaurants for dinner. The Central Hotel Shanghai includes a traditional Chinese restaurant and a 24 hour coffee shop that offers a mix of Chinese and western cuisine. Still feeling sodden and unadventurous, I opted for the buffet dinner at the coffee shop. Not my best decision. Unlike most aspects of the hotel, dinner at the coffee shop was only of marginal quality. Although several entrees were offered, including sushi and a few traditional Chinese dishes in addition to a number of western-styled foods, none were particularly fresh or well made. Everything was institutional and bland - a ridiculously boring dinner in this city of thousands of interesting meals. Still, it had the distinct advantage of being warm and dry. My room was equally satisfactory: although not overly large, it featured a firm, comfortable king-sized bed, four enormous pillows and a scattering of throw pillows. The room was attractively decorated in pale yellow and gold, with polished wood accents. Two armchairs flanked a small table next to the windows, which overlooked the high-rise surroundings. Like many Asian hotel rooms, this one had a bedside console to control lighting, HVAC, the large flat screen TV, and so on. Lots of nice high-intensity lighting throughout the room, silky linens, and an overall air of quality furnishings invested the place with a nice, relaxing vibe. The bath, although small and clearly of older vintage, was scrupulously clean and in good repair. Again, as is typical in China, the complimentary toiletries extended to a bounty of multiple toothbrushes, mini-towels, lotions, cleaning cloths, unguents, and potions, all neatly arrayed in soldierly ranks next to the sink. The public portions of the Central Hotel Shanghai include a large fitness center, a sauna and massage area, meeting rooms, a business center, and several high-end retail shops. The lobby and mezzanine are attractively furnished in dignified marble and gilt and the whole place has the same upper-end hustle and bustle you'd find in a similarly-positioned hotel across the globe: lots of sleekly modern folks with cell phones and laptops busily scurrying in and out of cabs, meetings, and the like. Although the staff were coping with the unseasonable weather, which made the marble steps and sloped drive rather treacherous, the entire hotel hummed with the quiet confidence of a well-oiled hospitality machine, and indeed, with the minor exception of my undistinguished dinner, I'd have to say that the Central Hotel Shanghai succeeds at meeting global standards for a four star property. My standard room cost the equivalent of about $100/night - from my perspective, a good value, if not a complete bargain. I think any visitor would be satisfied with this hotel in this price range. "
central hotel shanghai ,"In the heart of Shanghai The hotel is a 4-star hotel, located right in the heart of Shanghai. Our transfer from Shanghai Pudong airport was painless with the hotel shuttle bus which delivered us straight to the hotel. The hotel is located less than 100m from Nanjing Lu, a major shopping district in the heart of Shanghai. Our room was a bit small, but it was nicely furnished and renovated. The sheets were of the highest quality. The outside of the hotel had neon lights which changed colours. Very pretty, but tacky. Reminded us a bit of a hotel in Las Vegas. People in Shanghai tended to leave us tourists alone, unlike people in other cities in China (e.g. Beijing and Xian). Touting was a rarity. All in all, we had a comfortable stay at the Central, although it was a bit pricier than other hotels. The location had its price. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Good location decent rooms This hotel is the default hotel for our tour group. The entire tour group stayed at this hotel at the beginning and the end of our 2 week tour. The hotel is located one block off of the very busy Nanjing lu walking street where one can find endless restaurants and shops. I think the location is superb. There is a convenience store about 2 blocks from the hotel. Caddy corner from Hotel Sofitel. This hotel is also close to several banks. I brought back all my shopping goodies before I went out to dinner with my parents at a nearby restaurant.The room I had was spacious enough for 2 twin beds. It had the usual writing desk and chair. Bathroom was clean and was stocked with shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste and toothbrush, comb and cotton swabs.Buffet breakfast was not bad at all. It had wonton noodles, udon, breakfast steak, sausages, eggs, fruits, congee, miso soup, salmon and assorted breads. Concierge was helpful in arranging transportation to and from the Pudong airport. I also exchanged some US dollars at the front desk although the rate was higher than I thought. In general, I was very pleased with this hotel and would stay here again.At the time of this review, this hotel is building an annex building across the street. "
central hotel shanghai ,Good value Great location for walking around the city. About half the price of the big name hotels in the same class 
central hotel shanghai ,"Great Introduction This was our first trip to China. Getting through customs at the Shanghai airport was horrific - took us 2 hours - so we had no high hopes for the hotel. We were on a Helen Wong Tour and fortunately we were met at the airport by the tour guide. She took care of everything at the hotel which was great and the stress of trying to communicate was resolved. The hotel was great - the room was immaculate and rather classy. The hotel had the largest Chandelier hanging in the Atrium we have ever seen.The Central is within walking distance of Nanjing Road and if you set out early you can see the residents exercising with Fan Dancing, Tai Kwon Do and even some groups Jiving to Rock and Roll music. At night we could see the lights of Shanghai which was really spectacular. Our entire experience was memorable and we would recommend the Central Hotel to anyone. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Good apart from the air-con problems The Central Hotel does exactly what it says on the tin. The location's great for a first-time stay in Shanghai - strolling distance to Nanjing Rd, the Bund and Renmin Park. Rooms are an OK size, spotlessly clean and have good bathrooms. However, on our visit, the room temperature was unbearably hot. When we asked for help in trying to cool the room, the staff told us that the cold air airconditioning had been switched off for the winter and the only option was to open the window and hope for the best. For three nights, neither of us managed a decent night's sleep because the room was like a sauna. We asked for a fan on our second night, which the hotel duly supplied, and that made some difference, but overall it made for a rather uncomfortable stay. It's worth noting that there's a shop on the ground floor of the hotel that sells soft drinks, beer, wine and snacks for significantly less than the minibar prices. Overall I'd stay here again if the aircon issues were sorted out. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Great Location Excellent for its location. My wife and I really enjoyed the hotel. It was right in the centre of all shopping and dining activities. And the Metro was within 5 minutes walking distance, while the rest of the highlights are not accessible by walking, thus made no difference. Even walking to the Bund is not that far.If u are coming from the airport, get the airport bus to the central (People's Park) and then i would suggest to get a cab to transfer u to the hotel, cos the short distance on the map is really quite far when u started to walk the distance. To take a cab from the airport is a rather costly affair. We managed to get a relatively high level after we requested, the only thing that we did not like is the small hotel rest area which was a smoking area and the locals are smoking away like a chimney. The staff was helpful, english was fair. Even when we arrived too early, but they expediate the process to get us into our room, which was rather sizeable.Overall, we enjoyed the hotel, didnt used much of the facilities cos there aint much anyway. "
central hotel shanghai ,"great hotel in great location stayed here for 4 nights, great location just walked across road to Nanjing road and heaps of shopping and restaurants within minutes. Hotel very clean and well appointed. Would highly recommend "
central hotel shanghai ,This Hotel Lives up to its Name A great hotel for sightseeing in Shanghai. Very clean and pleasant rooms. Huge bed and all you need in a bathroom Two minutes walk from the best shopping in the City and and surrounded by restaurants and bars.We only had breakfast here but that was excellent.All the staff appeared to be happy and smiling. 
central hotel shanghai ,"Excellent hotel in great location We have just returned from a three night stay at the Central Hotel as part of a stop-over in Shanghai, and were very happy with the hotel. The room was very spacious and clean (bed was a little hard for our taste, but I understand that's how they prefer beds in China) with a massive TV and desk, room servicing was good, there are non-smoking floors, and the staff were professional and courteous - we had no trouble communicating in English with any staff there. The buffet breakfast was also quite good with lots of options so long as you don't turn up just before it closes.The hotel is just off one of the most bustling parts of Nanking Road, the main shopping street, and most of the rooms would have great views over the neon-lit shopping area at night. We reached the hotel on foot from the airport via the maglev train and then subway, which has a stop only two hundred metres or so from the hotel.The only reason I haven't given the hotel a 5/5 is that the price, at about US$150 / €100 per night for the cheapest class of room including two breakfasts, seems a bit steep for this part of the world. That's about the price I would expect to pay for a similar hotel in New Zealand, where wages and costs are much much higher.We'd reiterate the warnings about the shoeshine scammers in the area. If you're forced into using their services despite frequent use of the word 'no', don't pay anywhere near what is demanded. "
central hotel shanghai ,"The great and the good The great thing about the Central hotel is it's location, just over halfway along the Nanjing road and one block back from the Peoples Plaza so not only are you in the midst of the main shopping street of the city but you can enjoy the elderly Chinese doing their Tai Chi in the morning! The good thing is that it feels more 'Chinese' than say some of the other larger European properties close by, from the Chinese bride in the lobby talking on her mobile to the good Chinese restaurant on the first floor which serves wholesome fare leaving off the menu some of the dishes so beloved of westerners, the ambience is good. The rooms are more than adequate with all amenities (try and book a corner room as it's more spacious with picture windows) and the service is always gracious. Its a short walk down Nanjing road to the Bund (The famous Peace Hotel is closed for refurbishment) and to the 'village' of old Shanghai. Word of warning do not get taken in by English speaking 'students' offering to show you tea ceremonies, art exhibitions etc - it's a scam. The food is varied and plentiful with the evening buffet good value. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel We had just spent time in Beijing and Xian with a tour group booked through China Travel Service. The hotels in Beijing and Xian were adequate and were certainly equivalent to our four star hotels in Sydney. The Central Hotel Shanghai however was more like a five star hotel. It is situated right in the heart of the shopping district , the room was A1 with all mod cons including a very comfortable bed, the buffet breakfast was as good as you would get anywhere and the reception area, staff and facilities were top class. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Loved the Central The Central was a perfect hotel for our short stay in Shanghai. It is just off the Nanjing Road providing easy access to this shoppers paradise without the noise of being actually on that road. From our 22nd floor room we could enjoy watching the locals perform their early morning exercises in the square below while enjoying an excellent room service breakfast which we preferred to the buffet in the restaurant.The staff were unobtrussive but very helpful when asked, providing softer pillows and helping with the operation of the in room safe very promptly. Everyone spoke English and made our stay a very pleasant one indeed. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Loved the hotel This is one of the best hotel i have stayed at in Shanghai, it is newer and cleaner than most hotels in the city, staffs are professional, i highly recommend this hotel to travlers "
central hotel shanghai ,"Wonderful hotel Stayed here for 6 nights while on a business trip - everything was great!Contrary to some other reviews, all the staff spoke enough english to understand me &amp; were all very friendly &amp; helpful. Room was spacious &amp; very nice, rest of hotel (lobby, business center, etc.) all beautiful &amp; clean. Had a very nice dinner in the restaurant the first night, nice breakfast (both Chinese &amp; western cuisine available) every morning.GREAT location - one block off the Bund, which is a major shopping area.One tip if you're going to Shanghai - bring sneakers or sandals to wear out so you will not be accosted by the numerous &amp; persistant shoe shine men, who will chase you down a whole block trying to squirt your shoe with polish! "
central hotel shanghai ,"fantastic location and lovely hotel we stayed at this hotel for 4 days and were very impressed, the staff at reception don't speak great english but then we were in China and I don't speak great chinese? check in was effecient and quick.rooms were spacious and well appointed, we had 2 double beds in our room which was spotless - always my biggest concern! room service was great and delivered quickly, we didn't use the resturants as you in such a good position for many others on Nanjing road. The lobby was beautiful and very clean I would certainly receommend this hotel to others for the location and ease and the price was very reasonable! "
central hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel great location This was my first time in Shanghai and I found the Central Hotel excellent value. We booked through a website to get a good discount on their rack rate. We stayed in a superior room on an upper level, which we requested. The room was more like five-star in quality, as was the service. All the staff I spoke to spoke English, including the check-in desk, concierge and business centre staff. The room was clean, well serviced and secure. The hotel is right near the heart of Shanghai, a short walk to the Bund, shopping and restaurants. The only thing that let the hotel down was the shuttle bus to the airport, which could use a good clean. Highly recommended otherwise. "
central hotel shanghai ,Terrible experiance The hotel staff could hardly speak English.Our room was broken into and our luggage stolen.Management were not helpfull at all.They promised to check their so called security footage outside our room but nothing was followed up.Breakfast was served in a room that was staffed by people with &quot;no&quot; english spoken.We were charged for food and beverages that were not consumed or ordered.A warning to westerners travelling to Shanghia. We would not recomend this hotel to any people who can not speak Chinese.An absolute nightmare. 
central hotel shanghai ,"Great Location LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION The best thing about this hotel is its location for shopping. A very short walk to the Nanjing shopping area. We went shopping till our hands are full. Walked back to the hotel, drop off the bags and went back to shop again. A lot of good buys! Also a lot of good restaurants. I would definitely consider this hotel again. The staff is very friendly, and the hotel is clean. The hotel room is nice and good size. Seems like they are renovating the hotel, and we stay at a recently renovated room. Very comfortable, except it seemed difficult to control the room temperature. Before I went, I was a little concerned with the noise as commented by one of the reviews here. Actually I did not hear any noise at all unless I leave my window open. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Very central good value This is a great hotel in an excellent location - 2 minutes away from Nanjing road shops, the subway, and the Bund. I've stayed in Shanghai 3 times now, and tried out a few different hotels, but for the price and location (and our view of Nanjing Road from the 14th floor too) this one is hard to beat.My only issue was that I thought I had booked a double, but instead received a twin - and it was two beds that couldn't be called double beds, but were bigger than single beds... I was expecting a double or queen size bed. "
central hotel shanghai ,"Check your bill! This hotel appearred to be value for money but found that they attempted to charge for items listed as &quot;free&quot; in the booking. We left with the feeling that the management and staff were purposefully trying to defraud us. Other much smaller problems included rooms not being ready when we arrived, bed sizes being smaller than booked, and problems getting our luggage delivered to our rooms. We have stayed at many other hotels in China and we give this one the thumbs down. "

central view suites ,"Good quality nothing special Stayed here only 2 nights during a business trip. People at the desk, not so nice, no welcome smile at all! Room is average size, but has some plus as a small kitchen (microwave and sink). There are two breakfast rooms: one the the ground floor, with a good choice but too crowded and another on the 14th (... well I do no remember exactly the floor...). This one is reserved only if you have a superior room, so few people in, but very poor choice in my opinion. Position is good, especially if you love italian luxury brands: Gucci and Bottega Veneta shop doors just next to the hotel entrance. "
central view suites ,"Great location but be aware of the extras I have stayed at this hotel 3 times, and the third will be the last. Upon reserving I was told internet was complimentary (I would never stay at a hotel who charge for that), but when checking out I was presented with a bill for 2 days of internet at the amount of 30 USD. I protested but they ignored that. They got the 30 dollars extra, but lost a customer. Location is great, breakfast is below average. Rooms are ok, but stiff prices for internet will keep me away from this hotel. "
central view suites ,"Great Value would definitely recommend I stayed at the Central View Suites on a trip to Shanghai with my mother and was very happy with my choice. The purpose of the trip was simply sightseeing, and sightseeing we did.I'm a very picky on cleanliness and this hotel did not disappoint. There was a convenient safe in the room as well as some snacks in case you get the munchies (though, for the price I suggest stopping to keep nearby). The hotel is located in what would be the high-end, name brand shopping district (i.e. gucci, prada, dolce, ferragamo, burberry, etc) I felt very safe walking the neighborhood late at night and early morning. It's about a 3 block walk to the West Nanjing metro stop. The more central hotels I looked up were not only more expensive, but after walking East Nanjing at night, I would assume much noisier as well. So for the price, you really can't go wrong.My only 'complaints' would be that the bed was a little hard for my taste, but you can request they add some padding to it (which I did) still a little hard but better. Also, I couldn't figure out how to keep the water from not falling out the shower.If you can even call those complaints, my overall experience was very pleasant and simple... and I like simple :) "
central view suites ,"loved this hotel beautiful hotel, nice rooms, clean, cental location. no need to stay at the ritz carlton when you can save money here. the only disappointment was the breakfast buffet in the morning. it stays open unitl 10am, but they stop putting out the (lukewarm) food around 9am. everything else was superb, including the front desk who went out of thier way to translate my list of things to do in english to mandarin--very helpful. lots of great bars in the neighborhood also, since the hotel bar is kind of dead at night.

citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,A great place to stay for a few days I stayed here for 5 days and really enjoyed the layout of the apartment (1 bedroom) and its proximity to Peoples Square and the subway - directly behind the Raddison Hotel.The apartments are cleaned everyday and I found all the staff friendly. I had vouchers for breakfast but only used them on one occasion. I preferred to find something down the street or drop into Starbucks which is 2 minutes away.The apartment is well layed out - the only thing it didnt have was a washing machine. 
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"The location can't be beat Very near People's Square, it's on the 1, 2 and 8 subway lines, which can get you to many parts of the city quickly. Nanjing St., New World Shopping Center, ATM's, post office, pedestrian shopping area, &amp; Shanghai Museum all within very easy walking distance. Lots of little food shops nearby for stocking the kitchen. The reception staff were professional and courteous and were helpful with providing directions, writing notes in Chinese, etc. The housekeeping staff were very warm and friendly. The room was quite spacious and I appreciated the free internet as well as the iron, hair dryer, refrigerator, microwave, etc. The ONLY downside was the breakfast, which was just awful. The restaurant converts into a kind of Taylorist, production-line buffet later in the day and you can tell. The restaurant staff were downright surly and the food was bleak. Definitely not vegan or vegetarian friendly. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Great Location – Basic Hotel ! We stayed at the Citadines in September for a couple of days and it was a good experience. The positives are – Location – That is a big plus. All the shopping streets are 5 mins walking distance and the metro station is close too so you can really get the feel of the city.Room - The room was basic but clean and well equipt with all the basics amenities of a hotel apartment.Business Center – There are a couple of PC terminals at the lobby which can be used to read about city and plan.They also allowed us a late checkout, assisted us with getting the cabs etc and finding out nearby ATMs.The Not-so positives are – Tour Information – there is not much information available regarding the city at the reception and there is this 1 guide book (no options) which u can take to get an idea so by the time you get a hang of it you have wasted too much time. Language certainly is an issue.Breakfast – First they had only issued 1 breakfast coupon for the 2 of us in the double room and after a lot of discussion the second coupon was issued but the breakfast was really bad / cold / stale. It’s better to book without breakfast and grab a sandwich from the Starbucks nearby.Overall it was a good experience for a quick rush. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Not Perfect but Worth it! Just went to SH for my fren's wedding during the very crowded National Holiday. We were lookin' for accomodation which is not expensive and good for travelling in group.I stayed in Citadines Shinjuku Tokyo earlier and was totally impressed. Therefore I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed if compare to my tokyo experience. However, when I look around the very very spacious 2 bedroom suite we've got, full equipped pantry and all necessary equipments including electronic vacuum cleaner....a BALCONY and 2 full shower/bathrooms which provide well balance private &amp; common area for each occupants during the stay....plus the very convenient location (block away from subway and heart of the city), this is actually a pretty good pick for those who's travelling in groups and looking for comfy but not crazily fancy accomodation! I admit that there are a lot of lacking...yet to be honest in Shanghai, you don't really need to dine in the hotel if you can easily find superb choices of any cuisine u wanna try.....I also admit that the service is not utterly great (they can't find my reservation even i gave them my print out confirmation note becos she wrongly type my first name in the last name space in the system.....not typing it wrongly once....), they are not bad if compare to average in China (sorry lthough i'm Chinese, i have to agree the service quality is never very reliable even in some really expensive spots) and they're helpful when you really need them (not so if you do'nt look like you really need some assistance) and they're cheerful most of the time at least!So i think i'll still go back to this hotel in future, cos it is cozy and spacious, kinda well maintained and clean...tho' not perfect but price worthy. Esp if you're travelling with groups of good fren and hunting for new excitement around the SH City, this place provide you more than enough! "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"great location but lacking. We recently spent 8 nights here on a business trip. The location was perfect and the 1 bedroom suite was spacious. There was small restaurant open for a very average breakfast. The only cereal on offer was fruit loops or honey puffs. The food was lacking in selection and quality. The staff could not speak english very well and it was difficult to discuss anything. There are really no other facilities at this hotel, no room service, no gym, no pool. What you do get is a spacious clean space in a top location for a very good price. For that it is worth the money, but certainly nothing to rave about. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Great location great value After reading many reviews about Shanghai hotels, I was expecting only bad experiences, but the two I chose (the Marriott Renaissance Yuyuan and the Jinjao Citadines) exceeded my expectations and satisfied all my requirements. Like all other Citadines where I've stayed, this one provides short and longer term studio, one and two bedroom apartment. My 1 BR apartment consisted of a separate full kitchen (not just a Pullman kitchen area off the living room) and separate bedroom and living room, and of course a full bath, with the basic toiletries (shampoo, soap, shower gel, toothbrushes and paste). The bedroom had a comfortable queen size bed and the living room also had a sleeper sofa, so this 1 BR could easily sleep four comfortably (sharing the beds of course). The property and furnishing all seemed new and were smartly furnished. My rear apartment (eleventh floor) overlooked a construction site and had an unobstructed view of the futuristic Raddisson New World and JW Marriott towers. The construction noise was nonstop 24 hours/day, but only seemed to bother me the last day. Currently, it would be difficult to find a hotel ANYWHERE in Shanghai where there is not construction nearby. It is possible that when this construction is complete, the view might be obstructed, but the apartments across the hall face Beijing Street and the small park across the street. My major criteria for selecting a hotel were convenient location, FREE Internet service, full included breakfast, English speaking staff, clean comfortable rooms and an affordable price. This Citadines scored a B+ pr better on all counts. The property is a five to ten minute walk to all of the following: the west end of the Nanjing pedestrian mall, several high end department stores and shopping malls with countless food courts with western menus, a near by street (to the west a few blocks) with many restaurants frequented by local Shanghaise, Peoples Square and Park and the metro center where the three major subway lies intersect (the 1, 2, and 8), the Shanghai Museum, Art Museum, Urban Planning Museum, and a bizarre stretch of shops just east on Beijing Street where you can find hardware, industrial parts, power tools, crack pipes, gears, and an eight story electronics mall full of kiosks selling semi conductor chips and every other part you would need to build your own computer or network one component at a time. (I'm not suggesting you shop there or even put this stretch of street on the top of your list, but you will no doubt be the only tourist walking through!) The Citadines provides two free Internet terminals in the lobby, and FREE wired Ethernet connections in all the rooms, albeit running somewhat slowly. The included breakfast were plentiful and varied every day, and included mostly Chinese and American fare (cold cereals, fried and / or scrambled or boiled eggs, breakfast meats, cooked vegetables, steamed buns, and always a lunch type entree or two, juices, coffee, tea, breads, etc.. While not fabulous, the breakfasts were more than adequate and changed enough daily so it was a week before I bored of it. For the money (I took advantage of a Citadines special sale price that ran between 550 and 650 ($75 - $85) total per day, the property was a great value compared to anyplace else nearby where the Internet would have been $10-$20 per day more. There was always someone at the front desk who spoke English well enough to conduct business and the staff were always friendly and helpful (which is not as common an experience as I would have expected elsewhere all around Shanghai). It seemed the majority of the guests were there on business and split 50/50 between Western and Chinese. Best of all there were no tour groups to contend with! The front desk does book tours though at what seem to be standard pricing. If you're looking for luxury five star accommodations (and Shanghai has plenty to choose from), this is not the place for you. But if your want a clean, comfortable stay in a convenient location at a good price, I'm comfortable recommending it. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Great location with spacious rooms This is a wonderful hotel right in the heart of the Nanjing road pedestrianized shopping street. It's about a 5 minute walk to the People's Square subway station and to the Nanjing road shopping street. Just down the road from the hotel is a small street where there are lots of little local restaurants and foot massage places (wonderful after a long day of sightseeing). There are a few excellent dumpling places along that street which have picture/english menus.We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was extremely roomy and comfortable. There is a separate kitchen and living room area with a sofa bed. The bed is rather hard so if you're not used to that it maybe a bit uncomfortable but that's typical in China... hard beds! We were on the 17th floor which had balconies where you could get good views of the city. There are two free internet terminals in the lobby to use. We had buffet breakfast for two included in our rate. The breakfast had a good selection of pastries and a few hot western and Chinese dishes. The one thing that was a bit odd was if you booked directly with the hotel, you only got 1 breakfast included in the rate for a 1 bedroom suite but if you booked it via another website (I used Agoda), it included 2 breakfasts for the room. We had hoped to take the Maglev when we arrived into Shanghai but arrived too late so ended up taking a taxi. We paid about 190 RMD for the taxi and from what I've read it seems like we paid a bit too much! On our way back we took the Subway/Maglev combo which was very quick and easy if you don't have much luggage.The hotel is excellent value. It's priced much lower than any of the hotels right on Nanjing Road. I've stayed at the Sofitel on Nanjing Road before and given the price difference between it and the Citadines, I would take the Citadines over it anyday. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Highly Recommended The hotel is a nice surprise for us. The one bedroom apartment is definitely a good solution for family with children – it has a queen size bed in the bedroom and a pullout sofabed in the living room. There is only one TV set but it is turnable, so one can either use it in the living room or the bed room. The apartment is spacious and well appointed, with a well equipped kitchenette and fridge!The hotel is very centrally located, 1.5 block away from People Square and the west entrance of Nanjing Road. Breakfast, included in our room rate, was very good with a great variety of hot and cold food. We booked the room via Expedia. For $72/nt (tax included), this hotel is already steal! I will definitely recommend it to anyone! "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Best value in Shanghai have stayed here about 6 times now Quite simply the best value in Shanghai. Forget the mini bar, the concierge, the overpriced dining and the other 'features' of western hotels. Book a room here and fill your fridge with locally priced items, buy some DVD's (there's a player in every room), and kick back and enjoy Citadines Jin Qiao. Everything you'd want to see in Shanghai is on your doorstep. The first time I stayed here I was initially hesitant due to the seemingly unbelievable price. But it's perfect, and yes, the price is unbelievable! Best location in Shanghai, I keep going back for more. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"The Location The location and price is probably the greatest thing ever abt the citadines brand. This is a more affordable option of the Ascott group of service apartments in Asia.For 699 RMB, you get a one bedroom apartment with a well appointed living area and sleeping space. I tried both the studio and one bedroom option in Feb and have to say the RMB $100 is almost silly to save. For the extra $100, you get a bigger space to roam and relax after a day of exploring ShanghaiThis place is 2 streets away from the Nanjing Street and abt a 5 minute walk away from Renmin Square and MRT station which connects you to everywhere . The bund and New Heights restaurant (overated) is abt a 10 minute cab drive away in peak hour so the location is unbeatable. I stayed at the Ramada for one night and at double the price, I would gladly trade the Citadines at my next trip for the bigger space and the fully equipped kitchen, living space and modes.It comes standard with everything you expect of a chinese hotel above 500 RMB, all the amenities, umbralla, in room safe etc and great Tv channels.the big plus of the place is the free internet, available in room and also at the lobby computers. The breakfast is so-so but the service is unbeatable.they can book train tickets, get your flight tickets (although I recommend booking them via ctrip to save yourself the hassle) and get you a cab. security is tight. Get a room not facing the construction site and you will sleep like a baby ! The restaurant next door is a great spot to eat late in the night plus the very very convenient 24hrs Lawson just around the corner of the hotel "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,Great Hotel This hotel is perfect for leisure and business travelers. It is located very close to People’s Square and the local subway line. Our small group had nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The rooms are very large (one-bedroom suites). The kitchens are well equipped for guests wanting to cook in their rooms. We received a special room rate and extra benefits when through the hotels website. I will definitely stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Shanghai. 
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Great value in Central Shanghai I stayed here for 2 weeks in Jan 08. Citadines is part of the Singaporean Ascott Group which runs serviced apartments. Citadines is the lower end (Ascott is high-end, then Somerset), but still definitely much better than local chains and the price you pay reflects that. Serviced apartments mean no minibar, room service or concierge, but there is an equipped kitchen with utensils, stove, sink and fridge (at least in the 1 bedroom suites). Unfortunately, the closest supermarket I could find was about a 15 min walk away on Nanjing Road Pedestrian street. The location is unbeatable for the price &amp; quality. You can get cheaper, but it'll definitely be a local experience which can be quite shocking if you haven't traveled much in Asia. Citadines is quite a deal for an extended stay.The design is quite upscale but the materials are a little cheap. Despite being newly built, the hallway carpets are already showing some wear. Not all the staff speak English which may be a problem. Breakfast can get boring after a few days but has a variety of Chinese and western options.There is also a laundry room on the ground floor. I didn't try the gym. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Might not be for everybody Location has a downside, this being it is located on two busy inner city roads, so be prepared for traffic noise. If you can put up with no small face cloths in the bathroom, hairs all over the bathroom floor, coffee stained bed linen, the windowsill outside littered with cigarette butts, mould around the bathtub,a complicated slow elevator system then this hotel is good value. For RMB620 (64Euro / 91USD) you will get a decent size apartment with a seperate bedroom, a fully fitted out kitchen, good size living room with sound system and 1/2 a dozen international channels on the tv plus free internet access. Walking distance to Peoples Square station with access to Lines 1,2 and 8. Short stroll to Nanjing Road walking street and an easy walk to Peoples Park, Shanghai Museum, Grand Theatre etc.The apartments are comfortable and reasonably clean, although there is a bit of wear and tear. Bathrooms are small but acceptable. Good value for the price and to be located right in downtown is a bonus. So if you are not to fussy and prepared to accept the not everything is perfect than this is a good choice. Much better than the standard hotel room. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Fantastic find! My husband and I stayed here in October 2007 for a three night mini-break and let me tell you, this place was such a find! We were so pleased with our choice for the following reasons:LOCATION: It was only a couple of minutes' walk to Nanjing Road (where all the action is), People's Park, Shanghai Museum and then a little further to the Bund (you MUST have a cocktail at sunset at M on the Bund - such a view!). We caught a taxi from the airport as we arrived quite late at night and couldn't get a bus or train, but the fare wasn't too expensive. The hotel is located just off a main road so it's easy to find, and the neighbourhood seems very safe (the streets were well lit and there were always lots of people around, even late in the evening). There's also a convenience store just a few meters away.ROOM: We stayed in a 1br suite and it was great. Lots of room, exceptionally tidy and clean, modern, secure, had a little balcony, great little living room area. We normally just stay in smaller studio-style rooms but we really enjoyed having a cup of tea and putting our feet up at the end of the day in our little lounge and watching a bit of CCTV for giggles (we can't speak much Mandarin so we amused ourselves by adding our own dialogue...). The bed was great - nice n' firm, but not too hard. It also had its own well-equipped and modern kitchenette.FOOD: We always prefer to go out and 'forage' for our own local food rather than eat any meals in our hotel, so we were in heaven to discover that just around the corner for our hotel was a 'food street', with restaurants and little hole-in-the-wall outlets. If you stay here you MUST go to Fry's Dumpling Shop. We ate breakfast there every morning and stuffed ourselves for about $2 each. It was fun sitting amongst all the elderly neighbourhood folk, crammed into the tables, slurping away on the most delicious, juicy dumplings you'll ever taste... Seriously, we still dream about those dumplings!PRICE: I think we paid about US$117 a night, which, given the quality of the accommodation and location, was an absolute bargain. We actually felt like we should've paid more for our room - it was that good. Don't be put off by anyone who labels it a business hotel - think of it more as a comfortable base for exploring, without all the frippery of a regular hotel. We don't care much for staying in places just because the hotel lobby is particularly swish or the on-site restaurant or breakfast is great, but we still felt that this was a lovely hotel with a clean, modern feel to it.And don't listen to anyone who complains about construction noise in Shanghai. It's a city that's developing at such a phenomenal pace that there's construction going on everywhere. We rather enjoyed peering down from our balcony at all the workmen below - and then shutting it all out in the evening when we went to bed (the windows were quite soundproof).Also note that a little Mandarin goes a long way in Shanghai - you'll need a phrasebook to ask for things like an extra pillow. But isn't that all part of the fun of travelling overseas?Yes, we will definitely return to Citadines Jinqiao if we get to Shanghai again and heartily recommend it to others. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Very Nice Hotel My family stayed in one-bedroom unit and we were comfortable. It has a queen-size bed in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room where the 2 kids slept. The small kitchen has compelete equipment.The location is very convenient, a short walk going to Nanjing Road. It is actually on a boundary between East and West Nanjing. If you are coming from People's Square, there is a small road beside Radisson Hotel where you can take a short cut to Citadines.The breakfast was good except that they served exactly the same main dish for two consecutive days. The staff were all accommodating. They gave us extra pillows, water, blankets. Everything was clean. Overall, we had a great time. We loved the place, the kids called it our second home. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"fine but tired physically my office in shanghai is on nanjing west road and huangpi. with the radisson new world's prices creeping up over the past year, i decided to stay at the citadines because of the reasonable price.i enjoyed the location. proximity to the subways and the pedestrian walk of nanjing east road is great.rooms are very basic. no carpets on the wood floors. beds were a bit hard and the bathroom a bit small. hallways are a bit tired. carpets looked like they had not been cleaned in a while. the &quot;gym&quot; was a converted one-bedroom with only two machines in it.breakfast buffet is good value at Rmb45 per person.conclusion: you get what you pay for. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Dark long corridor... I stayed for 1 nite on 25 April, in the Studio room. This was my final nite in China, and was travelling alone.The room was alright, bright with standard hard bed.However, the toilet was a bit dark, with yellow lights.The corridor was worse, I stayed in room 1509, and had to walk a bit from the lift. The corridor was not properly lit up, some lights were not on, hence it was kind of eerie. And although it is close to train station, there is a construction site just beside the hotel. Meaning you have to walk past it before reaching the station. I came back at night around 9pm to find it rather dark. I will not recommend any single gal to stay here unless (1) ask for a room near the life (2) take a cab back when you are coming back late.However, the plus point is that it is very near to the famous clothing market - qi pu lu. About 10 mins by cab. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"I can see why westerners like it I stayed one night at the Citadines.It’s clean, and the apartments are well designed.If I was in Shanghai for over two weeks I could see the benefits, but it’s not designed for only a couple of nights.As a tourist it will seem cold and as a business stay there is nothing at the facility on the whole. I know I will attract negative reviews by taking this position but I am sticking to my opinion. The attached restaurant (French style) is very very average. The staff are great but the food is overpriced and boring. The only buffet meal offered by the hotel is breakfast and even that is limited. In all the rooms well designed and new..Yes.Heaps of westerners to talk with..Yes.Need to make your own fun? You sure do!!...because it’s not under that roof. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"best location in shanghai We stayed at the Citadines for 4 nights, after 3 weeks of traveling China. For us, it's been like being at home, after so many nights at hotels rooms . It's been wonderful to have a separate living room, a small but yet fully equipped kitchen and the wonderful &quot;serpa&quot; delivery service which the hotel is connected with, whom provide food delivery from the best restaurants in the city within 40 minutes. The apartment is small but very functional, clean and nicely decorated. The staff is very nice, but only part of them are speaking English, and not so well.There is a free internet at the lobby, and a small seating area with newspapers. The location is amazing, just five minutes walk from Nanjing and the people square, just behind all the posh hotels as Radisson new world and Meridien.The price we got through the hotel site was unbeatable and very low for shanghai.The only complaint I have is that they didn't mention the launderette at the hotel, and suggested their very high priced laundry services which we used. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Location Location As i've made a decision to always look out for ascott groups accomodation first anywhere i go, i chose Citadines Jinqiao as the other Acsott properties are a bit steep. Had a great time in Somerset Makati hence my expectation was kinda higher when i arrived Citadines. It is not up to my expectation but it is stil up to its Ascott property standard. It's very clean, the staff are very kind, friendly and helpful. Surprisingly the breakfast is so much better than what i had at Somerset Makati. I had the 1 bedroom apartment. It's compact but nice. All the kitchen utensils are available and this includes a small dishwasher which is very practical. Do not drink from the tap water. It tastes very strange even for the fact that i've boiled it twice! The sofa bed in the living room is really cosy and i loved it. The place is quite small but i guess Citadines are made for that. Intended for young single executives. Location is great. It's walking distance to everywhere. There's a coffebean and a family mart (convenient store) at the corner of the hotel hence making this place a very convenient place to stay in this vibrant ever busy (and full of contrsuctions) city of Shanghai. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Conveniently located This place is quite conveniently located, near to People's Square and Nanjing Road. Restaurants and fast food joints are plentiful in Nanjing Road area, so food was not a concern.We stayed in the one bedroom unit with a sofa bed in the living room area. The first few days was woken up by sounds of banging. There was a note on the table notifying us that this was due to the redecoration of parts of the building next to it. However what struck me was that the hotel should have put us at the other end, as when we made our booking, they knew that we had a small child with us. Thankfully the banging wasn't at an unbearable level.The breakfast wasn't too bad, except for the yucky coffee. At RMB40 and child RMB20 it was quite a good spread. The lobby area is quite nice and underutilised when we were there, especially the reading and tv area. One evening my family and I went to read the newspapers and as it was becoming dark, the staff quickly came to turn on the lights for us. Staff wise, there are good points and bad points. Some staff were attentive and helpful, some were the total opposite. The doormen noted down the taxi's numbers most of the times when we arrived or left and this is a good practice. We had to change room on the last day as the heater/airconditioning unit decided not to function properly. This surprised me as there was no maintenance staff to check this matter immediately. They sent the cleaning crew to see what was the matter and because they could not sort it out, they just decided to move us to a new room. Overall we had a pleasant stay and would stay there again. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Cleanest Place in Shanghai It was my first time to Shanghai &amp; we booked 5 nights at Citadines Jinqiao Hotel partly because of the first &amp; only review I found here. Now there are more &amp; I'm gladly adding my own. The rate was very affordable at around Rmb500 considering it's rated 4 star. Indeed, the location is very ideal. We took the Maglev from the airport then the subway. It was just a few minutes walk from the exit 6 of the People's Square metro station. Turn right from the hotel &amp; you can find the Family Mart convenience store as well as a Starbucks. About 3 blocks to the left is Huanghe Road where one can find a lot of local restaurants that stay open late. Our room faced a small park &amp; it was quiet at night with not much noise from the street. It is a short walk to Nanjing Lu. Walk east for about 20 minutes &amp; you reach the Bund passing by local hardware stores. Aside from it's location, the best thing about the studio room we booked was it's cleanliness. In our experience, it seemed to be the cleanest place in Shanghai. It also had a microwave, fridge, dishwasher, iron, in room safe, kettle, stove &amp; utensils, etc. as it is an apartment hotel. The room key card that you need to use in the elevator sometimes took long to work in the elevator that you have to try inserting both sides. The toiletries were basic, nothing special but the towels were spotless white. The tap water tasted strange so we had to gargle with the bottled water which is the only safe water to drink in Shanghai. Breakfast was so so but was still a good value for RMB40. Beware to use the correct date on the breakfast voucher as they will not honor past dated voucher. We just tore the topmost vouchers without checking the date. I argued with the front desk that this should not matter and they should have warned us. They insisted that the breakfast provider at the hotel is actually a separate company from the hotel. They then just agreed to give us one complimentary breakfast. Some breakfasts, we just looked for xiao long bao outside the hotel. The English speaking staff were very helpful, even spending quite some time with me figuring out how to use the IP card. The doorman almost got us ripped off though when he tried to give us an unlicensed maroon taxi as we were leaving for the airport but just in time a lemon green Dazhong taxi dropped off an arriving guest so I insisted on taking it instead which fortunately had a jolly driver who spoke a little English which was rare in our stay. Overall, we were quite satisfied with our stay in this hotel. We'll most likely stay here again should we go back to Shanghai. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Excellent service and amenities. New We stayed in the studio - it has a dishwasher, toaster, microwave, induction hob, and all the pots/pans/utensils that you will need. Everything looks really new. Room very clean. 5min walk from 2 subway stations and 5min walk away from 1 end of the famous Nanjing Pedestrian Mall. Good service from staff, who were very helpful and could speak English. It was pretty cold in Shanghai but the room was toasty warm - almost stuffy so we took off our thermals &amp; opened the windows for some cool air. 2nd night we figured how to turn the fan function on the air conditioner so it was much better. Would definitely stay there again. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"brilliant value Prior to being put up by a conference company in the uber luxurious Grand Hyatt, myself and my wife wanted some slightly more affordable accomodation in Puxi for a long weekend.For what you get Citadines is great value in a seriously good location. At RMB650 a night for a one bedroom unit we were certainly not complaining.The emphasis is on the practical, but with a separate living room and bedroom, and decent sized, well equipped kitchen, it feels more like home than a hotel. The bed is comfortable, there is good working desk, in the living room, and always like to have a sofa and coffee table.The location just behind the Radisson is superb. This gets an excellent rating simply for being such good value for money - in a city where hotels are getting increasingly expensive. "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"Great Stay at the Citadines We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights at the end of October - the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly although few of them speak English which made directions a bit tricky. However those who did speak English were very helpful and would write the name of the location for us which we needed when getting taxis. The room was a good size - there was a microwave, sink and even a little dishwasher there which was cool. The room and the hotel were spotlessly clean. The breakfast was good value - but slightly over priced.The location of the hotel is ideal it is only a 5 minute walk to Nanjing Road - so even if you dont have a good sense of direction you can always find your way back to the hotel. Another bonus was the free Internet access provided in the lobby.I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Shanghai - it seemed to be very popular with business people but there were still quite a few tourists there - I would stay there again "
citadines apart hotel jinqiao ,"A Practical Alternative I stayed at the newly renovated Citadines Shanghai Jinqiao for 2 nights in a 1-BR suite. The property is well-located for those who prefer to be near Nanjing Road. It is only a block away from all the shops (and mayhem) of this pedestrian street which seems to be ground zero for shopaholics. Citadines is also conveniently close to 2 metro stations making it very easy to check out popular places like the hip Xintiandi area. It is also a very short cab ride away to the colorful bazaars of Yuyuan Gardens. The property occupies a rather drab looking building which I'm sure used to be something else prior to the takeover of Citadines. The decor throughout the apartment-hotel is simple and devoid of anything grand. The halls leading to the units are also sparse and utilitarian. The apartment units, while simply furnished, are very clean and one can only marvel at the sheer amount of closet space available. The attached kitchen is nicely equipped with all modern conveniences and utensils so this should be good news for long-staying guests. There is a small dining area off the lobby which serves breakfast and other light meals. The greatest advantage of staying at Citadines Shanghai is the very reasonable rate they quote for their units. I paid the equivalent of US$100.00 for a large room in an apartment-hotel so close to Nanjing Rd., a premium area quite known for hotels which charge at least US$200/night (Le Meridien, Radisson, JW Marriott). I was quite satisfied with my choice of accomodations and I will surely stay there again. "

city hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel but small rooms My stay at the City Hotel was wonderful. Service was excellent, the front desk personnel spoke great English, and they were helpful in recommending sites and restaurants in the area and happy to call cabs for me in the rainy weather. The rooms were very clean, we had a nice view of the city, and the bathrooms were very nice. The only flaw with the rooms is that our room was the smallest I had during my stay in China, but it was worth it given the hotel's amenities and service. The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood, 2 blocks from a Starbucks serving breakfast and lunch, and with lots of cute stores nearby. I would stay at the City Hotel again without hesitation. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Good place for the business traveler Did stay in this Hotel for 4 nights...had an fantastic room almost on the top floor with an breathtaking view over Shanghai...Pretty close to the old exhibition center and that´s what I was lookin for...Will stay there again next year.Don´t think that I would stay there for Holidays, most attractions are too far away, but anyhow...spending your holidays in Shanghai???? xcuse me?What was terrible: The breakfast...gosh that was bad....just had it once and that was enough...okay..no need for this... "
city hotel shanghai ,"Definitely an excellent hotel Extremely well situated right at the French concession; We booked thru Rates to go with an excellent rate of 42 euros/room however Rates to go service is just useless as they have forgotten to fax our reservation. City hotel managed to get us 2 double rooms, Very reliable and helpful staff. . We did not get any breakfast at the hotel as you can have the chinese breakfast (dumplings) for 10 yuan at 15 meters from the hotel or Star'bucks at 50 meters.We are extremely pleased with this hotel and will certainly come back for our next stay in Shanghai "
city hotel shanghai ,"Surprinsingly very good We stayed at this hotel for a week and based on my previous experience, this hotel is really good value for money. The faclilites are excellent and the staff is simly great, very helpful and always with a smile on thier face. Please be aware that they will tell you what you need to know and no more, I mean you wont get any proactive advise, for instance, if you ask how long a taxi will take from the hotel to the airport, they will say about an hour, but will not explain that there are road works on the way and could potentially take considerably more time. This s not an attitude is simply the way they are.This hotel is located right in the French Concession near beautiful shops and some hidden beautiful restaurants. (Avoid the restaurant on 1 South Shanxi Road if you are not adventurous). There is a wonderful little sort of eatery on Shanxi Road (left hand side of the hotel, same side walk - you need to cross the 1st street and then keep walking for around 50 metres) You can see how they cook dumplings. You need to buy tokens from the lady at the cashier and then exchange for the food you want. We had really unexpensive wonderful dinners there. Also their stuff is very friendly and very willing to give foraigners a hand. I would go again anytime "
city hotel shanghai ,"Exceptional MGMT As a traveler you always dread the unexpected surprises when traveling, especially after a tiring day or a long trip. Not here....everyday was a reward to one's self for a job well done. The City Hotel and it's staff where exeptionally accomodating and quick to please. A reflection of it's management attitude to provide 5 star service and exceptionally reasonable rates. It is convienetly located to great shopping, good restaurants and the metro is a short 12 minute walk away. You can only pay more to find a hotel with this level of comfort and service. All of the hotels in house restaurants provide stellar food and service. Its also a great place to relax, have a quiet business cocktail and enjoy great fare at reasonable prices. With its fitness center, in house spa there is absolutely no reason to leave. I now call City Hotel home when traveling to Shanghai. Thank You to the Mgmt for a job well done and for making me feel like I was someone special! Jerry Lee Gomez San Antonio, Texas "
city hotel shanghai ,"Positive experience I spent 6 nights in City Hotel with freinds. we were on the 25th level. It was awsome. The neighbourhood is clean, lots of shopping, transportation...Staff are freindly. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Perfect Location We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our September trip to Shanghai.We really liked this hotel for several reasons:1. Location - It is situated in very close to the old French Concession area of Shanghai, so if you want to walk around and take a look at the &quot;old&quot; Shanghai of 20s and 30s - it's a perfect place. Also, two blocks away is West Najing road with TWO huge brand new malls, which house all of the brand shops you expect to see in a major city - D&amp;G, LV, Armani, Versace, etc. So if you're into shopping - the location is excellent. Also this hotel is away from the major tourist areas, so you won't find big crowds of peddlers of fake goods (DVDs, bags, watches, etc) as you might closer to the Bund or East Nanjing Road.2. Food - there are several restaurants in the hotel, including an Excellent Japanese sushi restaurant, American Steakhouse and a tradition Chinese restaurant. It's very hard to find a place in Shanghai that has all those choices under one roof. Plus two blocks away in modern malls on Nanjing road you'll find more restaurants choices - Western, Chinese, mixed, etc.3. Service - everyone is very friendly and helpful.Rooms were pretty good, nothing exceptional, but very clean and had everything we expected to have. Plenty of English channels on TV, which is always nice to have in China.We actually paid extra to substitute this hotel for another hotel, because of its' location and we weren't disappointed. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Average simple business hotel Average Shanghai business hotel 2km south west from People square. In my opinion a good solution for whoever is looking for a clean hotel, quiet at an affordable price. Service is good, english speaking personal. The breakfast is above average.The main weakness is the swimming pool and fitness room. The best is to consider that there is none. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Avoid this hotel! A group of 6 people rented three rooms for the period 19-24 April, and then 4 people stayed yet another night between 25-26 April in this place.During checkout on the 24th, one of our rooms was quite full with boxes, bags and suitcases. In this chaotic situation one of the cabin bags was left either inside the room or outside the room, but not with us. Returning to the hotel later that day, we realized that this bag is missing. To make a long story short:- it took two hours to convince hotel personnel to look for this bag, which then was found partly emptied- the hotel acted very rudely towards us, like it was our fault- despite our repeated attempts we never received any papers enlisting the damage we suffered. We finally received a Chinese-language fax which is probably the Shanghai Police notice of the events.- the hotel made us feel like idiots and to make matters worse upon our return, one of the bellboys dropped a suitcase and damaged another.My advice is to avoid this hotel, there are so many other nice, clean hotels around! "
city hotel shanghai ,"Unpretentious but good hotel I stayed at City Hotel in Shanghai for ten days, from the 18th to the 28th of December and I spent a nice holiday there. First of all the location: The location is ideal, five minutes walking from the central Shanxi Nan lu metro station, in the French Connection, one of the best areas in Shanghai. The staff is friendly and helpful and at the front desk there are ladies who speak English. I know people who stayed in other four stars hotels in Shanghai were nobody of the staff spoke English...;-( I changed rooms twice, the first one at the no-smoking 10th floor and the second at the no-smoking 17th floor, both very clean, confortable and with a nice view of the futuristic scenery of Shanghai. They were both superior standard rooms so that the cheapest ones but, anyhow, very nice.I had breakfast few times in the hotel. It is not included in the room rate and it cost 80RMB, about 8 euros/ a day. It is not too bad but I agree with the previous review of Mr. Amherst: the staff is not always very friendly. By the way, there is a Starbucks 3 minutes far from the hotel where sometimes I had my breakfast. I did not try the restaurants and the cafè in the hotel.The only bad thing of the hotel was the deposit they asked me in advance the first day I arrived. I had already paid all the amount for the room through Expedia but they asked me 3000RMB (300RMB per day) for any possible service I would use for the forthcoming days. I refused to pay all this money so I gave them 600RMB for the deposit that I had back the last day.Besides, the 24hour music cable radio on the corridors of the floors is simply terrible. "
city hotel shanghai ,"An OK hotel The hotel's location is ideal, somewhere in between the Huaihai Zhong Lu in the old French Concession and the Nanjing Xi Lu, with a comfortable distance.I made the reservation on the internet through a travel agency in Shanghai, and was informed that I would pay my bills to the hotel directly. I fount the people at the front dest were very friendly. Later in my room, I somehow forgot about the little keyholding box by the door. When a bellboy took my luaggage into my room and left, I could not find the room key, which the bellboy had left at the door key holding box. I called the front desk telling the person that I could not find the key. They duplicated the key for me immediately in a friendly manner.The only place I feel needed improvement was the Vienna Room at the breakfast time. The services were VERY uneven. Sometime the service was friendly and efficient, but in other morrnings the services were cold, negligence, and VERY bad. The hotelroom service was good. Cleaning ladies were conscientious. I particularly remember a cleaning lady on the 10th floor, Ms. Wu Yuxia. Still, after a few days staying at the hotel, I haven't used to take the roomkey out with me when I went out, and I forgot the key in the room and could not get in. I found Ms. Wu Yuxia and told her about this. She helped me by making several phone calls, and finally openned the door for me. She apologized that she must follow the rules before letting me into my room. This was evident of a responsible employee at the hotel. I believe she deserves my thanks and respect.I also found that the bellboys and people at the hotel gate were quite friendly.I stayed at the hotel for five days, but I did not have chance to taste the several restaurants in the hotel. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Never been in any bad place like this before It needs at least 2 pages to describe all feelings I got from this hotel. I've been in many hotels around the world, only cheap hotels made me feel a bit upset (not much coz I know what I should get for that rate).At City hotel, even smiling was quite hard to get at the first step of arrival. That's the 1st thing. The 2nd, my flight arrived Shanghai at 6:30 p.m. so, I asked the hotel to keep the room for me. They asked me for the credit card guarantee even my company sent reservation letter at least 2 weeks prior. So, my company sent the comfirmation letter to the hotel again as City hotel is one of our contracted hotels.The 3rd thing was, they asked for credit card guarantee which is fine for me if they just did it for guarantee. But what they did was blocking a whole amount of staying, 9 nights plus personal expenses 300 RMB per day. It was charged 8,100 RMB at the first night!!! And what made me so angry is that amount is blocking my credit line, STILL! (I checked-out from this hotel since Nov. 29, 2006. The actual amount already cut from my credit card but the guarantee amount is still there.) The 4th was, the services at Front desk, cafe at the 4th floor and else were ineffective. Some of them couldn't understand English at all. The 5th, I ordered breakfast box on only WEEKDAY since I had to go to work very early morning. And I wrote on the paper to show the receptionist that I didn't want any on WEEKEND. What I got was EVERYDAY boxes even on the last night I called the receptionist to inform that I wanted to wake up late on the departure date. The receiver didn't understand what I said then sent room service girl to ask what I want again. I did explain to her again and she seemed understand it very well. Guess what I got, I got the box at 6 a.m. as everyday!!!The 6th, I always got all services from the receptionists without any smiling. Only a few girls there can smile and know how to deal with guests. For me, some of bell boys at concierge can speak and understand English much better than receptionists and also know the word, service-mind quite well. Moreover, it's a bit ridiculous for me when I, a guest, had to greet them first everytime we met. Being nice is not suitable for this hotel, I guess. :PAnyway, maybe, I expected too much for the rate, 862 RMB per night. What I can say for this hotel, its location is the best thing nothing else. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Nice clean tourist class hotel in great area I booked a 3 night stay here via Travelocity - deluxe room was reasonably priced at 104 USD per night. This was attractive compared to the chain hotels whose rates were at least 50% more. The location is in the French Concession on a main road with lots of boutiques and little shops. About 4 blocks from the metro stop (Shan Xi road), which is a huge shopping area as well. Safe area at night - no problems walking alone or getting a taxi.The front desk staff speak reasonable English and buffet breakfast was included in my room rate, which was convenient. Food was average with a selection of western and Asian choices. There are only a couple floors that are non-smoking (4?) and the room was very clean. The bed was a little low (no boxspring) but nice and firm mattress with lots of pillows. Bottled water (2) was provided in the bathroom and replenished daily - which I needed for brushing my teeth (don't drink the tap water!). The light system was a bit complex to deal with - I could not find a setting to shut of all the lights for bedtime. In the end, I simply removed the room key from the power setting at the door.The crowd at the hotel appeared to be mostly tour groups from Europe and parts of Asia, with the occasional vacationing couple. Would stay here again if the rates were still relatively reasonable. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Nothing bad to say about this hotel Shanghai City Hotel was a positive suprise for me and my mom who really expected just a shabby 2-3 star hotel. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything was new and clean.The staff where very friendly and did indeed speak english. At least so much that we where able to conduct our buissness and the needed services e.g. getting a taxi, adresses written in Chinese, using internet,exchanging money. Certainly the hotel is worth more than 3 stars, it is if not a 4 star at least 3++. The price is very cheap compared to what I would rate the hotel and the location couldn`t be better. 5-10min walk to nearest metro station(Shanxinan road) and taxis always waiting outsaid the hotel. The &quot;doorman&quot; always very polite greets you and asks if you need a taxi.Then he goes and gets it for you and even tells the driver in Chinese where you want to go. Be sure to take the hotels card, on which it reads in Chinese the adress of the hotel, whith you when you go by taxi so that you can show it to the driver when you come back. We stayd 6 nights in the hotel, booked by the internet the superior room, whitout breakfast. (Cost about 200 euros/person)Everything went smoothly, we even tryed the brekfast for a couple of mornings and where very pleast whith it. I would certainly use this hotel again when returning to Shanghai. It was cheap, well located,(just beside Hengshang Moller Villa) clean, renewed, friendly and just 5-10 min walk to Nanjing or Huihai shopping street, metro or Xiangyang &quot;fake market&quot;. Sadly the fake market will be moving to some other location in July 2006. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Fantastic breakfast I was amazed at the helpfull nature of the staff and there willingness to try to speak english. I was a few months pregnant and the breakfast did more than needed to satisfy me and the baby, it was varied and great. We Only stayed 2 nights back in April 05 and its ideal location to the famed fashion market and Yu Yen gardens was great. Will be going back to Shanghai again in March 06 and will definatly stay in the this hotel.Did not realise till leaving there is a cash machine in the lobby tucked away round the corner, so much easier than trying to change sterling at the desk.Forgot to submit review last year! "
city hotel shanghai ,"More than 2 stars I was surprised to see this hotel rated as only 2 stars, perhaps because I stayed in an &quot;executive&quot; room on a nonsmoking floor. I would give it 3 stars, and would stay there again.I had one serious problem, which was that the room smelled of sewage the first night. However, the smell was gone by the next morning and did not return except faintly in the bathroom from time to time. I suspect that if I had complained they would have moved me to another room.The room was nicely decorated and clean, if a bit small. The free internet connection worked well, though I would recommend leaving your computer off or disconnecting it from net when unattended. Note that internet is free in executive rooms, and costs extra in other rooms. The internet fee almost equals the difference between a deluxe and executive room, so you might as well go for the executive level if you want internet access.The light switches by the bed were a little illogical -- the left-hand switch operated the right-hand light and vice versa. English TV channels are minimal. Sound insulation seemed good, and you can open the windows slightly even though it's a high rise. The location is convenient to most of downtown Shanghai.The included buffet breakfast is reasonable quality and presents limitless opportunities for stuffing yourself. The Western food doesn't vary much from day to day, but the Chinese dishes seemed to change more. I didn't sample the other food.The staff is friendly, but the level of English is uneven. I had better luck face to face than on the phone.The executive room rate includes free laundry service for one tee-shirt. I found out later that this is per *stay*, not per day, which seems stingy for a long stay. "
city hotel shanghai ,"It's good I didn't want to pay lots of money and some hotels are now very expensive and not very Chinese. I took a suite at City which cost $160 ish. I was very pleased with it. It's Chinese and whilst room service doesn't always come exactly as ordered, they will immediately go fetch bits you wanted with a willing heart. I stayed for 6 nights and found the staff friendly, helpful and will refuse a tip if offered! It is well situated to see the sites. It made my trip really enjoyable and will use it again because it's Shanghai, some of the other hotels,you could be anywhere in the world. "
city hotel shanghai ,"Great location good value This is a nice hotel that is within walking or short cab distance from almost everywhere we went in Shanghai. The common areas are beautiful and the rooms are above average (mine was a little worn, but clean). One thing I liked about this hotel is that I could open the window in my room. The internet connection in room was fine, and they have a business center that can help with a variety of services. Breakfast was included with the room and they had a wide selection of Asian and European foods. My only complaint is that the staff doesn't speak English well enough to consistently get you the food, information, or directions that you need. The supervisors can help, but we had a few mis-ques that were annoying. "

Outstanding Courtyard hotel, with marble lobby and foyer. The staff graciously granted our request for extra towels too. Room service was satisfactory and everything was clean. The bathroom is immaculate, with a deep tub and two massage showerheads, perfect for a tiring day of exploration.Within walking distance were a few Chinese and international restaurants, a shopping center, a subway exit. The Pudong sights are one or two subway exits away and People's Square is the exit after those.Free wifi would have made our stay perfect, but internet access was just too expensive.If you're on a budget but want to stay in a comfortable hotel that's nearby the main attractions in Shanghai, this is the place for you. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"My ""go to"" hotel I have stayed at this hotel at least 10 times. It might not be the greatest hotel in Shanghai but for the price it is my hotel of choice. The rooms are clean, the food is great, the service is excellent, and the location is strategic. For me, I like to stay here because it is closer to the airport and also closer to the Pudong Riverwalk area with the great restaurants. A taxi to the hotspot is about 5 minutes and 15 RMB. Everyone speaks great English and the GM is a wonderful Aussie lady who really knows how to run a hotel! For the price you simply cannot beat it. The breakfast buffet is excellent. I only wish the internet was cheaper than $20 per day, but that is a Marriott decision throughout China... "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Great Value The best Courtyard Marriot you'll ever stay in. The restaurant, club-level lounge, room -- everything was much nicer than you'd expect at this price. I wouldn't stay here on vacation, but for a work trip it was just right. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Excellent value and convenient We took advantage of a very low rate on expedia, and although there were some surprise fees (perhaps fully disclosed but hard to understand), it was a very good experience. The location is quite convenient - very inexpensive to get a cab into Puxi, or to take the metro, just two blocks away. Good breakfast at a &quot;au bon pain&quot; type place 1/2 block away on the way to the metro. We at first were unsure of staying in Pudong because it seemed so far from the 'action' in Puxi, but really it's so easy to get back and forth, and frankly we liked Pudong - easier to breathe, and the price was just incredible. Rooms were very nice, and staff was very friendly and helpful. Only complaint - the business center is astronomically expensive - you can easily spend more at the business center than your room costs, so keep it to a minimum! "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Very good hotel for a correct price We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and found a very good hotel for a correct price. Although this is not a luxury hotel as a standard Marriott hotel, we had a big room with a king size bed and a high quality service. The staff speaks a very good english, which is not the standard in China.I would recommend this hotel for people looking for a good and reliable accomodation for a good price. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good Stay for weekend. I got quite a good deal at just over 450 RMB per night over the weekend including tax.Very helpful staff at the check-in desk, they were a big help as I had problems with my checkin. The staff at the lobby bar is also very friendly and helpful. Overall I had a good stay at the hotel over the weekend. It is quite new a new shopping mall called 96??? "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good The location of this property may not be too strategic for shopping but due to convenience to office, i have selected this hotel. The rates offered is also quite affordable compared to many other hotels. Though the hotel looked quite dodgy from outside but its actually not too bad. What i like about this hotel is the room is actually quite nice and cosy. The rooms are also kept very clean which is my main concern. I had trouble using their steam iron and within few minutes from my call to the operator, I had the housekeeping girl came to assist me. Though sha cant speak english very well but she is definitely very friendly and helpful. The reception staffs were quite friendly as well. I also like the bellboys cos they always helped me to catch a cab. They were helpful all the time.I would recommend this hotel for those who wants value for money. I only used the room and breakfast facilities, the rest I have not explored. As for breafast selection, it was not too extensive but i love the croissonts! It was excellent! "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good Hotel Great Service for the frequent traveler. During 2007-2008, I spent 6 months (off and on) living in Shanghai. The Courtyard Marriott became my 2nd home.The hotel itself is a 10-15 minute walk from the PuDong Times Square (shopping area), but there isn't much else near the hotel, and there is limited food (McDonalds, local restaurants) nearby. The restaurant itself has a nice Chinese and American restaurants, although it is a little pricey (typical for Shanghai restaurants that cater to Americans). The rooms are very clean, but are slightly below average in size, and non-descript.However, what I loved about this hotel was the staff. They will do anything to please you if you just ask them. One of my colleagues lost his luggage and only had one shirt, but the bellhop top his only shirt and found a laundry service open at another hotel at 2am and had it cleaned for him. This was typical of the service level that I experienced. After being there for 2-3 weeks, all the staff called me by name.If your business travel requires you to be within walking distance of PuDong Times square, I would recommend this hotel. If you are traveling on vacation, I would recommend a hotel on the Puxi side. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good Hotel Very helpful Staff I found the hotel comfortable &quot;Not Luxurious&quot; The staff were very polite, and helped whenever asked.Breakfasts were good, The Place to eat looked very small, but there was always tables and so it worked very well&quot;The food of an evening and day is excellent value for money and the staff are happy to explain whats what.Only complaint i had , was the prices of the drinks &quot;alcoholic&quot; Spirits are extortionate , doubles i would avoid , at best they are triple the UK price if not more.The internet is also far too expensive, although worked well &quot;This should have been Free of charge&quot;I would certainly stay here again on my next trip "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"A very friendly hotel...but not near anything terribly exciting We stayed here for 4 nights for business and were quite pleased overall with the experience. The rooms were clean and designed in an Asian theme. Beds were comfortable, and pillows fluffy. HOWEVER, it was freezing cold in the city when we arrived, and there was heat in the hotel. The front desk said that the heat is controlled by head office so they do not have authority to turn it on and off at their free will. So we froze. They did give us extra blankets, but in zero degree weather, we need heating. Especially considering it's a Marriott hotel! For food, McDonalds is just down the road a bit, and there are plenty of local restaurants near the hotel as well. Unfortuantely, there is only one shopping mall within walking distance from the hotel, but there is a larger one further down the road (we didn't try to walk it), but I suspect it's a 20-30 minute walk away. Also, you have to pay for Internet. It was quite expensive from what I remember. I'd go back if they'd turn on their heating when it's cold, and AC when it's hot. P.S. Andy the bellhop boy is a gem. Very smily and friendly. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Average Business Hotel Rooms:Low ceiling but room furnishings and bed was clean and comfortable. Toilet could do with a more luxurious feel. Air-con temperature not adjustable or slow to response. Breakfast:Service staff was courteous. Unfortunately, food was never replenish and there were too many empty trays (did not matter if I came to breakfast at 7.30am or 9am). Hot food (i.e Fried Eggs, Noodles) counter kitchen staff generally ignored the customers, so had to raise my voice to get some attention. Food was too plain and if this did not come with my Room fee, I would not have bothered. But savings grace was their Juice counter which had a variety of freshly squeeze juice.Facilities:Gym was small and not condusive for a workout.Service:Generally, the staff was courteous and good natured. Room extension for 1 hour was rejected. This hotel also caters to local businessman, and they tend to bud-in when you are dealing with the counter staff.Location:In the Pudong area with many local and also cheap eateries nearby. For shopping, there is a local shopping mall 2 blocks away. Within 10mins walking distance of Yaohan and Times Sqaure. Massage Shops (probably the happy ones) round the corner. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Very plush comfortable Hotel more than the average traveller needs No mistake this is a very nice hotel - but probably a bit over the top for most travellers paying their own bill. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean, service is first class - but the place lacks any real atmosphere. Ideal for a business trip or an overnight stay but not really for the leisure traveller. Pudong is a fair hike from The Bund, Yu Gardens and Nanging Road so holidaymakers might be better off with a more central location. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,Very good hotel in Pudong One night stay for business.The hotel was suggested by a major customer with special rates. Slept in a big suite at a very good price. 
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Very good hotel in Shanghai A perfect hotel in Shanghai, with a very helpful and smiling staff. We definitely recommend this hotel, even if it is a bit far from the city centre (if one can define a center in Shanghai), and reachable by direct metro (line 7, 4 and 6 at Century Avenue) or taxi (not expensive, expect 20 RMB minimum to go to old town for instance). "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,Decent hotel good location Stayed here on a free night in Shanghai. Decent rate and good location. About 2 blocks from metro station. 45 mintes by taxi to airport. 
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Not Marriott Quality; There Are Better Places in Shanghai I spend many nights a year at Marriotts because they are consistently above average. This hotel was the exception.The front desk check-in was slow and lackadaisical. They refused to accept my Marriott card for reasons that they could not explain. When my message light was on and the message said there was a package at the front desk, they could not find the package (it was delivered to my room several hours later.) There are not enough elevators to service all of the floors, and they elevators were s-l-o-w. The food was average.The room was smallish. There was one small water bottle in the room (for two people) whereas every other hotel we stayed at in China had two large ones. The hair drier did not work and there was a large stain on the carpet. The first morning we were there the room contained 6 packets of decaf coffee and none of regular. The second morning we were there the shower head blew off the shower when we turned it on. The soap bar in the bathroom was miniscule; hardly shower size.This was the worst hotel we stayed at in China. I could not believe it was a Marriott property. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Decent and Good Value A little rough and worn around the edges but decent hotel for business or pleasure providing good value. Comfortable bed (Marriott standard) and average room size. Could be a little cleaner (carpets need good cleaning) and hot water takes some time to get going. Staff is English-challenged but you can usually communicate or they'll find staff with better English skills. Restaurant (Spices) has limited menu and food is just average. For example, fish and chips should not be frozen fish sticks. Recommend you eat out or at another hotel (e.g. Shangri-La has good restaurants but pricey). McDonald's and KFC are within walking distance if you are desperate for fast food. ATM (China Construction Bank) is right around the corner.You can walk to nearest Metro station (Line 2) about 15 minutes away (Century Avenue station), which can put you on the other side of the river in the heart of the Bund (Nanjing Road) in about 10 minutes. Walking distance to Oriental Pearl Tower and two tall towers (Jin Mao and Shanghai World Financial Center); about 20-30 minutes.I prefer Renaissance Pudong because it is newer and nicer but you can save a couple hundred or more yuan by staying at the Courtyard. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Very happy with this Hotel I am writing this from my room in the Shanghai Courtyard Marriott on my third night here. MY AC works great; the food is very good (a little pricey, breakfast is overpriced for Shanghai), room service is quick and efficient. Taxi rides to everywhere are very reasonable and there is a metro station within a short walk. I have had no communication problems and everyone has been extremely nice here. Best of all the bed is larger and the pillows are down-filled and abundant! Much better than my first five nights which I spent at the Zhongyou hotel. Great hotel if you are here on business. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good Value Hotel. Location is ok. For the money, this hotel is a decent deal. Although, there are better options out there. The hotel is clean as well as the rooms. Nothing fancy. It is an american business hotel. Although, it is much bigger than the Courtyard Mariott's in the states. The food is great in the Cafe, especially the buffet. The bar is in the atrium and is nice as well. The A/C for some reason doesn't work very well. We had problems in one of our rooms with the A/C and were switched to another room. The lobby is also hot sometimes as I guess the hotel likes to save money on A/C. It is about a five minute walk to the Metro and we couldn't find the hotel upon exiting the metro, so make sure you get directions where the hotel is upon exiting the metro. I would definately recommend taking the MagLev from the Airport to the Metro, then using the Metro over a Cab ride, it is much cheaper.It is located in Pudong, but there is not much around. Cab rides around the City are very cheap, so getting to the Bund or the French Concession is fairly inexpensive. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Great value hotel! I am glad I stayed at the Courtyard Shaghai in Pudong. This hotel is superior than the Courtyard hotels in the US. The entrance lobby with marble floors is elegant. My room and bathroom were clean, quiet and the bed comfortable. They provide you with terry bathrobbe and slippers. The staff is courteous and always smiling. The times I requested room service, they were at my door within minutes. While the hotel offers Western and Chinese cuisine, I preferred to eat in the restaurants close to the hotel, which are very good and inexpensive. The only drawback is that is not close to downtown Shanghai. You have to take a taxi or the subway (a 5-10 minute walk). Fortunately the cost for a ride into town is dirt cheap, anywhere $3.50 to $5.00 and taxi drivers don't expect a tip! "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good business hotel Good hotel for business purposes but because it's in Pudong, you have to rely on public transportation or the cab to go to Shanghai which means planning about an hour each way. Otherwise, the rooms are nice, clean and comfortable and the service is what you expect from MarriottCourtyard. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Good quality convenient location A fairly typical Marriott hotel which fills a tower in the Pudong area of Shanghai. This is the main business district and the hotel is squarely aimed at business customers. This is not the cheapest business hotel in Shanghai by a long way, but it's not extortionate for the level of service provided. It has all the usual features - reasonable sized rooms with good quality beds and furniture, effective air con, good cleanliness, well equipped bathroom, Internet (at a charge), hotel shop, concierge.... Breakfast is plentiful and available from 6.30. Some unusal items that reflect the local cuisine, but all the western staples are there if you are not feeling adventurous.Most desk staff are English speaking; other staff less so, but no major problems encountered.A big plus is that the hotel is only a block from the Shiji Avenue metro stop. This is on the line that connects with the airport maglev in one direction, and runs through the city centre in the other. In total it took me 30 mins from leaving the airport terminal to arriving at the hotel, which is 30 mins less than it took a colleague to do it in a taxi.There is also a range of shops and restaurants within walking distance. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Take the Heat Five nights of Misery. Lack of quality communication is the basic harrasment you will face. Most of the staffers are trainees so they are worse in language and skills.My misery royale was the poor airconditoning and roon temperature around 24 degrees celcius and to add injury to nsult they maintained that its official temperature.No senior met me to resolve the problem or change my room. Food and room service a disappontment. In general a total disappointment. f i had time i would have checked out the second day.Saving Grace is clean rooms, comfortable beds and good housekeeping. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Beautiful Hotel This is a beautiful hotel and the staff was supremely welcoming. My workplace booked this hotel, so I was not expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised. My one and only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is that the restaurant menu could have had more selection for dinner. However, I'm a picky eater so don't put too much stock in that comment. Breakfast buffet selection western food) was really yummy. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,"Best deal in Shanghai I've stayed at a number of Courtyards in the US, so I guess I was expecting something similar in Shanghai. Instead I was treated to something more on the level of Marriott's finer domestic hotels. The staff was great and it'll cost half of what the upper echelon hotels will run you. The neighborhood is a bit boring, but a $2 cab ride will get you to the subway and from there anywhere you could want to go. "
courtyard by marriott shanghai pudong ,Great Hotel Stayed 5 nights at this wonderfully run hotel ..congratulations to all the staff .. professional and very polite and friendly.

courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Very good indeed! Me and my father (family owned business) stayed at this Courtyard Marriott for 4 nights this mid november. We got a good rate on Expedia (USD108), which I thought to be reasonable compared to similar grade hotels (150 and up). Having stayed at a &quot;chinese&quot; hotel in Hangzhou, I decided not to adventure again. kept it simple with the Marriott chain.The hotel is very new - it just opened in June, so all amenities and commom areas were very well mantained. Awesome bar at the lobby floor, very stylish, cool restaurant on 2nd floor and a nice gym at 4th (pool too). Location-wise, its perfect - just byGrand Gateway mall, metroCity, a subway station and Papa Johns and Starbucks!! Being a brasilian with an american education, I just loved to re-encounter papa johns pizza again!! And all of this on a 3-5 minutes walk!The bad part is all services are paid - breakfast was not included on our rate, so add another 26 USD and USD 17 for internet. But still, if you are in leisure and just want to check emails, it's cheaper to go to a cybercafe. And for the food, go to starbucks or Costas Café, and you'll be set. However, I must be fair, it's one hell of a breakfast they offer, and for americans and europeans, where breakfast anywhere may be around 20-30 USD, this amount may be just about right - but even though it's very well served, it's a little to much for my brasilian budget (in comparison terms, a nice breakfast here costs around 10 bucks).One short note, there is also a tailor shop right before the inside front door of the hotel. They have this special sale, where you can get 3 custom made shirts for 48 bucks each. I just couldnt hold myself and bought 9 shirts and loved it!!! They deliver in 2 days.In short, I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to people. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"New pristine hotel super service good price The service was superb. The staff was plentiful and always available and eager to help. The room was beautiful, pristine, nicely appointed, and had an American soft bed! Apples in the room. The hotel is brand new and spotless. After a month of standard Chinese hotels, and firm beds, I found this to be heavenly. Location is very good. A beautiful 6 floor elegant mall across the street. Subway stop just up the block. Rooms were running about $90+ per night. Restaurant offers western and Asian foods at reasonable prices. I loved the hotel, the staff, the room, and the amenities. The internet is a bit pricey at 120 yuan (about $17) and the breakfast buffet with an amazing array of delicacies was about 170 yuan ($25). So if you and in breakfast and internet, it's not as much of a bargain. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"I had a great stay at this hotel I had a great stay at this hotel. I have chosen this place since it was the only international hotel in Xujiahui Area. I was very surprised which product is behind the new Courtyard line. It has nothing to do with the American ones and even the European Courtyards are different. This one is a full service hotel and doesn’t look like a Courtyard.The Gym and the swimming pool are fantastic and the service and food in the Restaurant is casual but outstanding. Especially the breakfast buffet is not what you would expect in a Courtyard, Honestly it is even better than in some Renaissance or Marriott’s I have stayed before. Rooms are ok, not big but cozy. Check in was good and the Service overall tried there best to make my stay comfortable. The bar gave me are good start in the evening with the happy hour and Alan was a great guy and filed up my glass well… I would recommend everybody which likes to have a five star stay for a four star pocket. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Big Surprise and fantastic stay I travelled to Shanghai for 1 day business and four days leisure and was booked in the newly opened Courtyard. The rate was very good and I thought, ok it's a Courtyard, but as I arrived I was amazed. What a great hotel. Not comparable to any other Courtyard's I have ever seen. Full Service Hotel with a great heated Swimming pool and a, I guess, around 250 - 300 sq Gym with the newest cardio etc. This Courtyard is designed following the new style, the friendly bellboy David told me proud. Check in was good, not great but the Lady was very friendly and explained me all amenities of the hotel. Also the MoMo Cafe Concept. I remember something with Modern Eating. Anyway, the restaurant offers a fantastic breakfast buffet with daily changing chef's special like a Breakfast Pizza or Spinach Frittata. Never had that before.. But the Pizza overall is just great!The room size is ok and the room design interesting with a sliding door to separate bedroom and bathroom. I personally liked it a lot. Room was clean.Staff is very friendly and try to do there best to made my stay most comfortable. They have done a great job since they just have opened in February. I definitely would recommend this hotel for any traveler. And thr location next to the French Conssesion is very convenient to visit Bar's and Restaurants. Also inside 5 minutes walking distance are three big shopping malls including IT with four floors. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Good job The staff in this hotel were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay, my compliments! As a gold member I got access to the executive lounge, which I can warmly recommend for any business traveller to Shanghai. The rooms are not big, but nicely designed, and the bed was great. The fitness center in this hotel is one of the few I have seen in an international hotel that feels like a real gym, also again thanks to the attentive staff. The prices are not yet as high as in some other good hotels in Shanghai, so in all, this hotel is a good deal. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Very Satisfied Customer (Twice) I have now stayed at the Courtyard twice over the last 3 months and each time have been impressed with the hotel rooms, facilities and staff. I have found the staff to be incredibly friendly and efficient. While the hotel may not be close to the city centre it is relatively close to areas such as the French Concession. For me it is a very convenient 5 minute walk to my office. I will not hesitate to return. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Terrible Stay... We were expecting this hotel to be very nice as it is the 800th one in the world. The renovation was quite pleasant in the lobby, but as soon as we got into the room, it was way too small for what we had paid for. The bathroom was linked to the entrance, some sort of architectural design to make the bathroom seem bigger. This created inconvenience because if one person was in the bathroom, the other person could not leave or enter the room. The bathroom door also had no lock. All we wanted was a pleasant, clean and care-free place to stay, but instead the bathroom design gave us unneccessary inconvenience to the hotel room use. This designis okay if you are staying by yourself, but definitely not for 2 or more people. "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"Disappointed We checked in the hotel 2 days after the official opening day, however, we still felt the hotel was not ready to open. No hotel directory, no toothbrush and no shaving kit in the room upon check in. I was asking the weather of the day, but they gave me a phone no. to call by myself. What a nice service!!! By the way, the toilet door was unable to open as its stuck on the floor. Upon checked, no sincere fond farewell and even THANK YOU FOR STAYING WITH US. VERY disappointed.... "
courtyard shanghai xujiahui ,"brand new courtyard the 800th one in the chain We checked into the brand new Courtyard Shanghai Xujiahui on 27 January 2009, apparently 4 days after the hotel opened. The decor is very modern and pleasing. The room we had for 2 adults with 2 beds was a bit small and the commode and shower were encased in a plexiglass material. For some privacy while using the bathroom one had to close the bedroom area off with the rolling breakfront. The shower was excellent with a choice of rain shower head or hand held adjustable shower. Bathroom amenities were very nice.The buffet breakfast was served in the executive lounge on the 23th floor. Not sure if this will be the case when the hotel is fully up and running. We enjoyed the coffee and bread and cereal options. Most of the hot dishes were Oriental items, so we stuck with the cold items and were pleased.The staff was gracious and helpful. Nice TV, reading material, computer access and sitting area available.They have a nicely equipped gym and an absolutely beautiful pool on the 4th floor.The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and near 2 nice shopping malls. The Grand Gateway mall across the street is really nice and has some dining options.We took the number 3 airport bus and then a short taxi ride to the hotel - cost 58 rmb for 2 people. Returning a taxi to Longyang rd and the MagLev to PVG cost 150 rmb for 2. These were 2 rather inexpensive options traveling between the airport and the hotel. We found all the staff very welcoming and helpful. They really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We were in Shanghai for 3 nights for sightseeing. The hotel is a bit out from the main attractions, but in a city of 20 million is was nice to be a bit off the beaten path. We can recommend this hotel and the staff and think they are off to a great start. Did I mention we were there in the middle of the Chinese New Year Celebration!!! Very loud and colorful, something to see.If you are looking for a nice new hotel with a good staff book the Courtyard Shanghai Xujiahui for your next trip to Shanghai. "

crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Loved the Hotel Crowne Plaza Century Park is one of the best hotels tostay in Pudong area. This place is ideal for business travellers because of the proximity of New shanghai International Expo centre and the Pudong Expo center both are about 5 mins from the Hotel.Almost everybody in the Hotel either speaks or understand English which makes it very convieneient to talk to the Concierge to get around the place.There is a near by shopping area called the Thumbs plaza which has a great ambience and athmosphere. There are several international food chains like the Pizza hut , Subway and also several bars and Pubs including the very comfy and laid back Irishmans Pub. The Irishmans pub is run by Deaglan a very friendly guy who has a steady group of Expats visting the Pub.There are also some cheap joints to have food including some Chinese and Indian restaurants.Overall its a lovely location and and a very good hotel to stay. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"OK but Renaissance next door is better. The breakfast buffett is poor This is a good location depending on what you are in town to do. It's quieter than some of the more &quot;downtown&quot; locations and if you are willing to walk 1 km or so, there are restaurants and stores nearby, as well as the MTR that can take you to downtown quickly and efficiently. This hotel feels dated. I stayed at this place and the Renaissance next door and the Renaissance is much better. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Nice hotel good location great ammenities but a bit pricey I stayed in this hotel in April of 2009 and it was a very good experience. The rooms are beautiful and offer very nice views of the Pudong area with the Financial District off in the distance. The service is excellent, the rooms are a bit pricey but they are very spacious and very modern and the bed is &quot;too comfortable&quot; and if you are not careful it's very easy to over sleep :-)If you have access to the &quot;club level&quot; then they offer exceptional services for business meetings, no charge for computer access or printing and there are meeting rooms available as well as a great breakfast buffet. All included in your room charge.The fitness facility and pool look great, but sadly enough I did not get to use them.I would say that the Chinese Restaurant on the 3rd floor is probably one of the best in the city, the food is outstanding and service is excellent. And the lobby restaurant is very good too.The Subway station is a short 4 block walk across Century Park (below the Museum of Science &amp; Technology) and there is also an amazing market place in this subway station that offers incredible deals on all sorts of merchandise ranging from clothing, to electronics, purses &amp; bags you name it. I highly recommend taking time to visit the Science &amp; Tech Museum if you can and definitely try to spend some time in that market place (often referred to as the &quot;Fake Market&quot; by the locals.The only draw back to this hotel is that if you are opposed to using the subway system then the cab ride across the river into Shanghai will take about 30-40 minutes so getting over to the Bund, Nanjing Rd, or XiTangDi will take some time. But other than that this place is great and I really recommend the hotel.Joseph SlobodaFort Lauderdale, FL "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Not more than average Stayed here a total of 6 nights, stayed on an executive room with access to the club lounge on the 25th floor. The hotel has some good restaurants, although I did not like the Heji restaurant on the 3rd floor. It felt too formal for its clientel, and the waiters were uninterested at best. Breakfast at the club lounge was boring, not much to tempt you in the morning. The evening buffet was actually better.Club level benefits were ok, nothing special, but some of the staff were quite nice and remembered my preferences well. Front desk staff were all business, not much smiles or personal service there.Rooms felt quite old because of the decor, and the bathroom I had was huge without really making smart use of the space. Showers took too long to become hot. Bed was good though.Fitness facilites were good, and the location is decent, although you have to walk a while to find decent shops and restaurants.All in all it was a experience that will not last, and I doubt I would choose this hotel again when there are so many others in Shanghai to choose from. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Good Choice To me this hotel is just right, it is a no frills hotel that offers everything I need jsut at the standards that I need them. Location is in a nice spacious quiet area of Shanhai( which is not easy to find). I enjoy this neighborly quiet part of town. You can stroll to century park or walk down a couple pf blocks to a shopping mall. Room are well fitted and appointed, bathroom spacious with windows. thi will be my new regular home when Im in Shanghai. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,Good Hotel in a Good Location - 4 1/2 Stars Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Century Park hotel for 4 nights the beginning of June. The hotel is very new and the rooms are large. Service was excellent and the food good. It is a three block walk to a shopping area with Carrefour and numerous restaurants. I would recommend and stay again. 
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Very good hotel excellent value. This hotel was chosen based upon reasonable transit to the Airport, coupled with value. The price I got through a website was unbelievable and I expected an average hotel - it turned out to be an excellent hotel in all respects - rooms, service, food, check-in service and location. In addition, you could get to the airport easily (40 minutes) using subway &amp; Maglev, or ('excitingly') a taxi for all or part of that journey. The location was very friendly for walking/jogging as there is a huge park nearby, wide streets etc. Not a great base for exploring the &quot;old&quot; Shanghai center, the Bund or general shopping but I will certainly stay here again whenever I need to overnight before a flight.

crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Very Nice experience Stayed here for 5 nights while attending an exhibition in Shanghai.I was upgraded to a club room. Club room had plenty of room, nicely decorated and a lovely bathroom.The club lounge is superb.Within walking distance of the Hotel there is a rather nice outdoor complex of bars,restaurants and shops that seem to have been built to cater to expats.Generally the area around the hotel is very peaceful and somewhat tranquil.Great for walkingService at the hotel was excellent .I will be staying here again in January 2009 for sure. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Value for money I am visiting Shanghai almost once a month and have, of course, tried many hotels in this city.Among the hotels in the Pudong district that I have stayed with for the last four-five years this is the best if you look on value for money.Very new and fresh, big beds and a nice bathroom make it an excellent choice.If you plan to visit Shanghai Exhibition Centre there is a free bus from the hotel in the morning and back again in the afternoon for every single exhibition all year round.The staff is “new” (as the hotel it self) and very keen to making your stay a comfortable one. Their understanding of English is over average compared to other hotels I have stayed with in Shanghai. It’s, in my experience, very rear that the bell-boy can have a meaningful chat with you in the elevator going up to your room.There is one restaurant on the ground floor operated by the hotel, which serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is, in my opinion, to expensive, but the food is good.On the third floor there is an independent Chinese restaurant (belonging to a chain as far as I know) which offers a traditional Chinese lunch or dinner. It is a huge restaurant with many separate rooms and several open areas with a lot of tables for two to six-seven people. I don’t know so much about this restaurant chain, but if you like Chinese food this restaurant will give you value for your CNY for sure! A dinner for three with tree-four dishes and two-three bottles of beer is a mere 150 – 200 CNY.On the 25th floor there is a lounge for those staying in Club rooms. They serve complimentary breakfast, beverages all day and drinks and snacks in the early evening. Nice area which will give you value for the extra 2 – 300 CNY you have to pay for a Club room per night.The close surroundings are mostly offices (Pudong local government is one) and flats. There are several small restaurants, a video shop, two bars, a massage parlour, a barbershop and two Family Marts close by. The area is quite popular among expatriates and you can meet many Europeans in the bars on weekends.For more serious shopping it’s only a short walk to Thumbs Plaza with many shops including Carrefour.For not so serious shopping it is a short walk to the copy market underneath the Science and Technology Museum. This is one place where you can try out your negotiating skills. Century Park, Shanghai’s largest park, is also within walking distance.A taxi to Times Square, Pudong (close to Intercontinental Hotel on Zhangjang Lu) is about 15 CNY and the same number of minutes. Here you will find several electronic markets and department stores with all international brands. There are also a large number of good restaurants in this area. The restaurants are not so easy to find though. Many are located several floors up and you have to be able to read Chinese signs or ask someone for the way to find them. Highly recommended is a small Sichuan restaurant in Thomson Business Centre ground floor for those who like spicy food and an authentic environment. I have never seen any Europeans in this restaurant over the years.If it’s your first trip to Shanghai or if you are a regular, Crown Plaza, Century Park is a really good hotel and can be highly recommended. "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Very Gem in a quiet and peaceful area of Pudong I was on a business trip on Shanghai and decided to try out this brand new Crown Plaza. I am very happy with my decision. This is a very nice hotel with great hotel room that has a big bathroom.Breakfast is good with a great selection of warm and cold food. The buffet dinner is well priced for the selection that it has to offer. Hotel staff are friendly and extremely helpful and service is very fast. It is about 15min by cab away from the bustling luJiaZui area and for some reason I feel that the air fresher and colder in this region. Within 2min walk there is a whole strech of shophouses which includes resturants (korean, Japanese, Chinese, Pubs), massage, hair salon, pharmancy, convience store etc (very convinence)Infact I have such a great massage that we have been having massage almost daily :)If you are on the executive floor then you will enjoy the large and well-designed lounge on the 25 floor of the hotel. They offers free tea (organic tea) and coffee throughout the day. I have been using this to host my business counterpart and this is a great place for serious business discussion. Infact there is even a meeting room (I think for 10pax at least) that you can rent if required. Do note that you can only bring in 1 additional guest FOC to the executive lounge at any one time.The indoor swimming pool is a bit small but is great for a dip. Following that you can have spend sometime in the jacuzzi followed by a sauna session, ideal relaxing if you have 1hour to spare ! (All these will close by 11pm so do be there early)Some of my other friends who have seen the hotel has already make this their must stay hotel in Pudong.For me, this is definitely my preferred hotel in Pudong "
crowne plaza century park shanghai ,"Value and Comfort in Shanghai This hotel only recently opened. The staff was courteous, though the front desk staff did need to be reminded to fulfill some requests. The location wasn't perfect, but it was 1km from Thumb Plaza, a wonderful restaurant location. The bed was comfortable and rooms were clean. The gym had most everything you would need. The air conditioning was loud. It was a nice business hotel. "

crowne plaza shanghai ,"Crown Plaza Fudan Shanghai This hotel is excellent for large tour groups like SmarTours. We stayed three nights. Great buffet breakfasts. Rooms are large and very clean. Only disadvantage is distance to the center of town. Since we were in a group, we were bussed to the attractions. A taxi would be required otherwise. Next year the city is hosting Expo 2010. Lots of construction in progress right now including a rebuild of the Bund. Would suggest waiting till after the Expo for a visit. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Luxury Hotel One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in. I stayed here for a month I was in Shanghai with work. All parts of the hotel are top class. You can chose from 4 different Breakfast ranges, Chinese, Japanese, European and American. Hotel food was best in Shanghai but came at a high price. If you have the money or if your goighere o business its the only option. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Exotic Shanghai I have stayed in there Pudong property, it's a lovely 5 star property in the out-skirts of Shanghai. Very close to free trade zone. Excellent value for money "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Good Hotel has all the regular features of a solid business hotel I stayed here for two nights (May 8-9, 2009) on a business meeting. This also happens to be the crew hotel for several major airlines.The first thing I like about this hotel is it's location. It's very easy to get a taxi (doorman will get it for you) and there are plenty of small to medium sized restaurants nearby that feature both chinese, western and other international fare.Check-in was easy and efficient. My bags were taken right to my room by an attendant. The hotel was in good repair and I didn't see any visible signs of wear and tear or things that were not functioning.. One of my favorite things about the whole check-in experience is that beautiful red fabric back-drop that is to the rear of the front desk.. very beautiful and elegant..My room was fairly large well equipped. It had all the features you'd expect.. a large desk, internet access is available in the room (at a charge), full international TV, coffee/tea maker, iron, etc. Nice big bathroom with tub/shower combo. Everything in the room was clean and nothing was broken or inoperable.As for the hotel itself, it has a large healthclub right on the premesis-- for a small charge-- pool, sauna, exercise machines, etc.. You could get a full workout here without missing anything.. There is also a fully equipped and staffed business center on-site. Computer rental, internet access, printing, mailing, faxing, translation, etc.. you need it-- they'll get it done.. There are three restaurants as well.. of course the requisite main chinese restaurant, a western/international cafe, a coffee bar with small pastries and sweets, plus a quasi sportbar-like place that offer lighter fare and drinks.. However, in my opinion, in a town like Shanghai, that is arguably famous for its cuisine, you really should take the risk and explore the cities diverse culinary side..My room was prepaid on a company account, so I can't speak to the rate. The service from the hotels' staff was friendly enough.. My one complaint-- such that it is-- is the staffs' lack of what I call &quot;forward thinking&quot;.. for example, I take my first cup of coffee with cream. If I ask for a refill of coffee, I would expect that the server either bring a cream/sugar offering (assuming s/he remembers my initial serving) or would ask &quot;would you care for cream or sugar?&quot;.. that may seem trivial, and on the surface it is, however, I use is as an illustration as to what I mean by &quot;forward thinking&quot;.. anticipating the guests needs-- before s/he ask.Overall, I'd rate this hotel very good for it's ammenities, room features and cleanliness.. While the level of high(er) end hotels has literally expanded like 10-fold in the past several years-- and the bar is now very high-- I still like this hotel.. it retains some local shanghai flavor without becoming just another gigantic, sterile, business hotel... and the location is very good for walking around and exploring. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Good as usual Stay there very often. Service on the exec lounge seems to depend on the people, some crews are very good, other talk among each other so loud that the guests cannot talk to each other. Rooms are nice, bathrooms quite small, but OK, no separate shower unfortunately.Nice job they have done in redesigning the lobby. Just missing the Italien restaurant.Overall - great "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Poor sound insulation 1.Sound insulation is very bad between rooms. I could clearly hear the person in the rooms next to me not to mention the TV, going to the toilet etc.2.Strange vibration through the room sometimes like a boom car is passing very annoying – maybe a train, or a cinema but I couldn’t figure it out but it was there and I was on the 22nd floor.3.Room was very cold when I arrived, outside temperature was 0 celcius and the room about 10 celcius. Put the heating on high and it took about 6 hours to get the room warm.4.Taxis are a problem – I had read in other reviews and I didn’t think this would be a problem but it becomes one when you stand in a line out in the cold and wind for half and hour waiting for the bellboys to wrangle up a taxi.5.High pressure sales to upgrade when you book-in that I have never experienced in a hotel before – quite strange but be ready for it.6.Internet very good.7.Room service not bad.8.Staff ok but a little controlling but then again this is China.9.Kettle in room which was great.10.Very clean but sterile rooms.11.

crowne plaza shanghai ,"A godd Hotel I spent 8 days at The Crown Plaza Shanghai, and chose this Hotel as it was close to places I intended to visit during my stay. The Hotel is not located in the Toursit area and is about a half hour cab ride to The Bund and main shopping area of Shanghai (Nanjing Road).The rooms were modern, quiet and very clean. I found all the Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. The Restaurants in the Hotel are OK, breakfast is the usual buffet, but I found the lunch and dinner menus did not have large choice of food. There are a lot of small independent restaurants close by, and a couple of good massage places to have cheap foot massages, a must after walking all day. Overall a very enjoyable experience. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Decent Business Hotel Compared to a few other hotels I've had to stay in Shanghai, the Crowne Plaza is a good selection.The location is in a fairly quiet street, near Huating Lu, good for shopping. I was not able to check any of the services the hotel offered, as I was mostly in and out of the hotel late/early, as my schedule was tight.I had a deluxe room, which was nice but average - the best thing was that I could open the window, not very common in high-rise 4* hotels, so I was able to turn off the aircon and grab some fresh air.The restaurant serves a decent buffet and some a la carte, although the service is a bit slow and clumsy. Breakfast also offers the standard fare and the overall price (around 100€ all inc) is a good deal for what is offered.The only drawback was the awful processing of my check out. It took them almost 15min to get my bill printed and, although I had pointed it out, that I neeeded it invoiced to my company, they got it wrong TWICE.NOTE: The KLM airline crews also stay here. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Better Than Expected We stayed at this hotel as part of a group tour of China. I was a little concerned about staying here at first, because on a map it seemed kind of far from the places we'd want to visit in Shanghai (i.e, museums, the Bund, the Pudong area, and the Old Town). One of the advantages, though, of going with a tour group, is that the tour company provides a driver, and although this hotel is too far from downtown to walk there, it took us no time to get there with our driver or by taxi. The location turned out to be pretty convenient actually -- there are number of little restaurants and shops in the area, a convenience store around the corner, a really good gelato shop two doors down, and an ATM right across the street. The other fun thing about this hotel is that some of the elevators have glass backs to the outside of the building, so you can get a view of the area on your way to and from your room. The business center is really nice and open late, which is convenient. The breakfast is good, serving both eastern and western breakfast foods, although the selection was somewhat limited compared to other hotels we used on this trip. The rooms were nice, and the beds were comfortable. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Pretty Good Hotel Intro- I have stayed at this hotel during many visits since 2005. Due to my changing work locations, I just stuck to the &quot;old formula&quot; of staying in a familiar location.Location and Logistics- This specific Crown Plaza is situated on a secondary road (Pan Yu Lu) which connects to the Yanan Elevated Road (S). - It is in an almost central location, in an area which is quite accessible to some of Shanghai's main sites.- It is however a problematic place to stay if you want to regularily commute in and out during morning or evening rush hour. The reason is because Pan Yu Lu is a 2 way-single lane road with medium range shops on either side.Rooms and Design- Rooms are quite spacious. They are equipped with the usual standard stuff like a Safe, Kettle, (nice) Toiletries etc- Internet is available but at a charge.- The Design is quite nice to the eye as well - good tan/brown shade finishes which make a cold day outside feel nice from inside.- They have a good range of TV Programmes as well.- The lobby of the hotel is so-so. The Breakfast area in the morning can get a bit crowded in the morning but the food is good and always fresh.Service/Safety- This is a good secure hotel with pretty stiff security and CCTVs all over the place.- The checkins can get slow sometimes since the hotel hosts regular flight crews which means bottleneck checkins at usually 2 counters working simultaneouly.Amenities- Theres a coffee shop run by the hotel just outside called Star walk Cafe. With a Starbucks opened up nearby, thats a plus for &quot;fast food&quot; type coffee lovers.- I haven't checked the gym or pool but I was told its pretty good.- The hotel actually shares a compound with a large cinema hall as well!Opinion/Pros/Cons- Pan Yu Lu can be a tight slow moving road at rush hour. It may even make your arrival time from airport extend by 30 mins! Total commute time from Pudong Airport in a taxi is around 90 minutes.- The hotel at night is not really in a very hip or trendy area with much nightlife around and its not a walk away from the famed Nightspot Tongren or Heng Shan Road.- Pan Yu Lu is however a very 'fully equipped' road with all kinds of shops for shopping medium range products like a range of clothes/DVDs/restaurants which are open at normal hours. This includes a 'legal' massage place suitable for all family members across the road.- The hotel is situated at a spot which is quite close to the Xui Jia Huai Shopping intersection and good distance from the Jiangan Temple (by Taxi).- Overall the hotel is a nice stay and quite comfortable but as someone mentioned...its a bit boring for some reason. It may be well packed with visitors but somehow still doesnt &quot;rock&quot; or isnt memorable.Cheers "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Good hotel so-so location... Both the service and the rooms at the hotel were good. The location of the hotel is in more of a residential district. It surrounded by several shops and restaurants which was convenient, but since it is not in the &quot;touristy&quot; parts, you will need to know some basic mandarin to get by. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Basic. Clean. But boring. I booked online so I could be with some business associates I had come to meet. I booked online and got a fantastic &quot;weekend package&quot; deal including breakfast for US$ 110 so very worth the priceThe rooms are large, clean, well stocked (toilet prodcts, mini bar etc) but the hotel advertises a Japanese restaurant, Charlies bar etc ... however ONLY the one Crowne Restauarant and very small lobby bar. So if you are looking for a busy hotel with many options dont expect that. Ify ou just want a central Shanghai well-located place; sure this is good as a base for business meetings etc Also if you ae here for tourism this is not the hotel as not walking distances from the bund or other major sights. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"a impressed hotel during my trip to China during the last Chritmas' and New Year's holiday, I traveled to China with my families. Booked by my Chinese friend, the Crowne Plaza Hotel offered an excellent services to us which gave us a memorable impression. The staffs are very friendly to our foreigners, in particular, some of them can speak English such fluently as they could answer my any request in English. The services are value-added in terms of its lower price. I wish I could enjoy their services next time when I have opportunity to China again. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"A good face-lift My recent stay in new renovated Crown Plaza Shanghai was a wonderful experience. Booked through hotel directly with a resonable rate because of the winter pomotion, efficient check-in as usual. It's not a new hotel but staff is very friendly and willing to help you wheneven you need. Room is nice and clean, with all facility and space you expect for a crown plaza room. Only one thing I may suggest is a bigger plasma TV which is becoming standard for most new hotels in Shanghai.The most impressed is the renovated lobby area, It really give the hotel a better image when you step in. Reception told me hotel is building new club rooms next door, hopefully I can try it next time I visist shanghai since crown plaza is my favrorit hotel in town "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Needs some work I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza a number of times over the last few years and have to say some of the rooms are starting to look quite tired and shabby.I was initially put in a room (on the sixth floor) with very little furniture and quite a threadbare carpet. I had to contact reception to get international dialling on the telephone. After an hour of incessant noise which sounded like it was coming from renovation work on the floor above, I complained and was moved without a fuss to a much better room on the 18th floor.The reception staff are all very pleasant and check-in and out is very efficient.Eating in the hotel is not recommended as the standard of food is not brilliant. Admittedly we went for mainly western food but even so I would have expected better.The lobby, bar and restaurant areas are due for rennovation later this month (Nov 2007). And judging by my experience some of the rooms are currently being refurbished. However with the choice and standard of similar hotels in Shanghai, the Crowne Plaza needs to improve. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Cut short my stay and moved for good reasons.... This was my most unfortunate stay with an Intercontinental Hotels chain property around the world. My stays at the China Holiday Inns have been much better. And of course, the Intercontinental Hotel stays have been great to exceptional.The check-in was ok, upgraded to a deluxe room, which was not deluxe in any sense. It was a very dated (early 1990s designed) room, nothing special or deluxe about it. I cannot fault the room for providing a quiet place to sleep on a western-style bed. However, if you are expecting more hospitality, go elsewhere.The staff is, well, just not trained in the IC chain style. Smiles and greetings are sparse and efficiency is lacking. One of the biggest faults is the lack of taxis. As many Shanghai travelers know, a taxi is generally a cheap, easy and mostly fast way to get around. This hotel is at least one km from the closest subway station, so you cannot fall back on public transport for a quick trip.The hotel was designed with no taxi queue! There is no place for taxis to park and wait for the lucrative fares coming from an &quot;upscale&quot; hotel. I talked with several taxi drivers, through an interpreter, and they said the hotel is too inconvenient for them to regularly service. Hence, the only taxis are those which are dropping off passengers. If there are no dropoffs, there are no cabs. This is a &quot;business meeting&quot; type of hotel, with many people lining up at once to get a taxi. One afternoon at 4 p.m., I waited for 20 minutes until I gave up and began to walk the streets. The hotel sent some bellcaps out to the street to lure in taxies, but they were passive. If you have ever seen the effort some doormen put out to find a taxi, you will laugh at this Crowne Plaza's attempt. A complaint to the front desk got indifferent shoulder shrugs and little effort to satisfy the guest for a basic hotel service. Translated loosely into English their (several front desk people) body language said, &quot;So what's new?&quot; For a traveler accustomed to warm Chinese hospitality, this place was cold as ice.I suffered from sticker shock on the internet charges of 120 yuan (over US$15 a night). This is the highest charge I have seen after maybe 20 hotel stays in China in the past 18 months. (Many are free, of course.) The breakfast buffet, for those not getting a &quot;free&quot; breakfast, was about 175 yuan per person, over $23 at today's exchange rate. Breakfast for two at the Crowne Plaza=almost US$50. It was not a spectacular spread, and they advertised their dinner buffet at the same price. It is price gouging to charge so much to guests looking for a western breakfast. (For China, the US$50 can buy a wonderful dinner for two at a white-linen restaurant.)Many times I pick up the &quot;vibes&quot; of a place, good or bad, upbeat or depressing. This property had sufficient negatives in convenience and costs that I checked out after two nights of a planned five-night stay. When checking out, no one asked why I was checking out early, if I enjoyed my stay, or gave me a comment card. Perhaps if they would solicit feedback from their customers, they would find out why it is not a hospitable place to stay. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Average at the Crowne Plaza We spent 6 nights at the Crowne Plaza Shanghai in early July 2007. We had just stayed at another Crowne Plaza in November 2006 on the Pudong side, so we thought we knew what to expect. It is a long ride to and from Pudong airport, so prepare for that when planning your stay. It is about 20RMB by taxi to central Puxi. First impression of the hotel was all right, but upon inspection it looks tired and worn everywhere, including the hotel band. We were on business and we had club level rooms booked. The rooms were ok, nothing to brag about and especially not the club-level I expected, quite small, worn out and the view was terrible. The club lounge was also a little tired and what surprised us the most was that there were no windows in the lounge. We ate at the hotel Chinese restaurant, which was quite good, but there are better and cheaper choices even on the other side of the road, just turn right and cross the street. We had a few beers at the hotel bar Charlies, nothing to tell our grandchildren about, very loud music by a terrible band and the price of beer was astronomical by any standards, a pint of local beer costing about 55RMB! Breakfast was fairly all right, but limited in choices.What upset me was that they charged one of us 134Euros directly from the credit card with no explanation, which we only noticed when we got back. Still trying to get an explanation, but so far no answers... Overall, not terrible, but not good either and the last part didn't help either. The Crowne Plaza on the Pudong side was so much better, but sooooo far away. Will be staying at another hotel chain the next time. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Great staff fine hotel This Crowne Plaza, one of three in Shanghai, is actually quite out-of-the-way on a back street off one of Shanghai's main shopping streets (although all the shopping is a couple of miles down the road at the other end). There is no Metro stop close by, which would make things difficult except for the plentiful supply of cabs, which are very cheap. Do be sure your driver knows where he's going though - some in Shanghai don't seem to be aware of the basic tourist spots! Inside, it's a comfortable international business class hotel, with several restaurants and bars. I recommend you book a room on the club floor for the extra space and comfort, the dedicated breakfast area and the priority check in on the upper floors. The room itself had a decent bathroom and was large with a comfortable bed. The internet connection was fairly slow, despite claiming to be 100 Mbps, but the TV stations were a good mix of CNN, BBC, some movie channels, etc. My real memory of this hotel will be the exceptionally helpful and friendly staff, however. I was unfortunate enough to be the victim of a crime in Shanghai (nowhere near the hotel, I should add), and two of the staff went out of their way to help me, accompanying me to the police station, translating for me, and generally reassuring me. I couldn't have thanked them enough, and highly recommend this hotel on the basis of those staff. It's a comfortable base, and a pleasant refuge from the bustle of this electrifying city. Incidentally, the crime I was the victim of occurred on Nanjing Road close to the Bund. It seems, from my research afterwards, that many others have suffered similar experiences in Shanghai. A man approached me on a Sunday afternoon and asked me to help him speak English. This happens a great deal in China. I resisted, but he seemed genuine and in need of assistance. I accompanied him to his choice of venue: an Egyptian bar off Nanjing Road, near the top end by the Bund (which he assured me was a coffee house, but was clearly, on entering, a red light bar). This resulted in me being asked for sex by prostitutes, and when I refused being presented with a bill for nearly 3000 Yuan (around 250 GBP) for drinks they falsely claimed the girls had consumed. I was threatened by male bouncers and not allowed to leave until I paid up. I did so and left, after which I called the police. If you are a vicim of crime in Shanghai, always call the police on 110. They were really helpful, found a translator for me over the phone, visited my hotel room, and eventually took me back to the bar where they got me most of my money back. The police take these crimes very seriously and will be helpful. Two further tips: don't speak to anyone on Nanjing Road, and avoid the Egyptian Bar just off the main street. It's full of appalling criminals.Enjoy the rest of Shanghai, though: it's a great city. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Better than ever I was a regular visitor to this hotel until they began the renovation work a couple of years or so ago when the daytime noise became too annoying. Having tried other hotels such as Sofitel and Hua Ting in the meantime, I was relieved to learn that the work was completed and I had no hesitation in returning for a short stay in April 2006. The rooms and service are up to the best Crowne Plaza standards and good value (at least for Shanghai) at about USD 120 per night ,particularly with the upgrade I usually enjoy as a Priority Club member.Although a bit out of the way from the main shopping and business areas, it is located in a very quiet and pleasant neighbourhood with lots of nice restaurants within walking distance. In fact if you don't like hotel breakfasts there is an excellent cafe with Chinese and Western dishes immediately next door by the cinema complex.If you don't fancy long taxi rides through the Shanghai traffic it is simpler to get a taxi for a 5 minute trip to the Xujiahui shopping area (several large stores and shopping mall) where there is a fast subway service to Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road shopping districts.Unless you have a lot of business in Pudong area I would recommend this hotel to anyone - it is also very close to Hongqiao Airport which is much more convenient for domestic flights than Pudong Airport. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"Good value nice place We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. We paid $81/nt for a single king bed and in advance. When we got there inspected this room, it was fine but, we paid an extra $25/nt and upgraded to a better king room with many extras including one breakfast(only one, regularly about $20, and not that good. if you are with someone else, you will probably eat on the street), free happy hour, 2 shirt pressing/day, 23rd floor usage where the happy hour room was located, internet, free drinks, good snack foods and a meeting area. It was worth it to upgrade, especially since even at $100 is cheap for a nice hotel. We used the business office twice but they are not very helpful, but they try. I wanted to locate a company but they had no idea what how to help or did not understand?? There is construction going on in the hotel but not near our room and I heard a hammer occationally in the lobby. While I was at the counter, a visitor was complaining about the noise, so they just moved her to another room. Over all the price and the service is a good value. The location is the French concession where there are good places to eat and places to see. Across the street is a good place for massage (one hour is RMB 70). "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"horrible construction work! I stayed at Crowne Plaza in Shanghai in December 2004 with my mother-in-law. I have often chosen Crowne Plaza hotels in Asia, because usually the price/quality ratio has been relatively good. However, this time I was very disappointed because there was a big room construction work going on, and we got our room just below the construction work. The noise was just terrible and plaster was falling from the ceiling. I immediately called the reception and asked if we could change the room (after 8 hours' flight + jet lag you need to rest). The change was not possible, we had to wait for the next day!!I fully understand that construction work have to be done sometime, but there should be a warning at the hotel website (in this case the work was done betw. 8:30-18:00 so it didn't disturb those who were on a business trip, but for tourists it was a nightmare). Additionally, the german girl at the reception just said that &quot;the walls are so thin nothing can be done&quot; - that did not make us feel any better! They could have given discount, free dinner or something.But there was a lot of positive things as well, both rooms were newly renovated and kept very tidy, breakfast was very nice (+ lot of variety) and there were a lot of shops &amp; restaurants in the neighbourhood of the hotel.Transportation to shopping streets takes time, the ring road was congested and it took 20 mins to walk to the nearest subway station. "
crowne plaza shanghai ,"A Good Value 4 star I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in November 04. It was very busy at the time but at check in they still managed to find me a non-smoking room which my agent had forgotten to request. The hotel, although not new, had attractive decore and was extremely well maintained with every amenity expected for its 4 star rating. My room was also attractive, spacious and very well appointed with efficient air conditioning and good tea and coffee making facilities. The room service and breakfast were also of very good quality. My only criticism was its position on the western side of the CBD but nevertheless, it was a very pleasant area with some interesting shops and restaurants nearby. If you dont mind not being central it offers good value for a 4 star property and I'd definitely recommend it and stay there again. "

crowne plaza shanghai ,Pulito e confortevole 
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Comfortable quiet welcoming....overall a superb place to say in this frenetic city of 20 million There are seemingly countless choices here in Shanghai as far as places to stay. If you're interested in being close to the Bund and the every-bustling and colorful Nanjing pedestrian mall, this is not the place. But if you don't mind a 25-40 minute taxi drive (depending on the traffic) to get Pudong or the Bund area, there's no better place to stay in Shanghai than the Crowne Plaza Fudan.To note:1) The rooms are great: spacious, comfortable and very pleasant.2) The beds are very comfy with a variety of pillow styles.3) Internet service is fast though a bit pricey at 100 yuan/day max.4) The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and usually comes with the room charge.5) The Saturday night dinner buffet (often a two-for-one deal) for 198 yuan per person is also sumptuous.6) The staff, from management to bellhops to door greeters, are all great....friendly, smiling and well-trained.7) There's a local restaurant that's good and quite cheap nearby if you don't feel like spending 60 yuan on a plate of spaghetti at the hotel resto. (I got a plate of reasonable pasta at this restaurant for all of 12 yuan.) Ask the concierge where the closest Chinese restaurant is, walk to it and then walk right past it and go into the inner parking lot area where you'll see the local, budget restaurant.If this is your first time in Shanghai, you won't go wrong by staying at the Crowne Plaza Fudan. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"An Exceptional Hotel At A Great Price! An outstanding hotel located in the Northern urban area of Shanghai (YangPu), just across from FuDan University. My first visit to this hotel was in February 2007 and is about the only place I will stay when visiting Shanghai. True, the hotel is a little out of the way, but it is nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown hotels which are priced like New York City. The service at this hotel is equal to or better than the higher priced downtown hotels at almost half the price. At night, the area is peaceful and very safe as you are across from the University in the area the students live. There is also a little campus shopping area 1 block from the hotel to get a sit down meal at a very reasonable price, along with convenience stores, coffee shops, fresh fruit, and a small grocery store to get basic staples.The staff is primarily Chinese and their English, and some other languages (French, Indian, German) are quite good to excellent. Most all of the staff are genuinely friendly to the guests, which is a rarity as I have lodged at several hotels in China where the &quot;friendly smile&quot; only goes as far as until you walk away. If you know anything about Chinese culture, many will put on a friendly face, even if they would prefer to...., well, you know what I mean.The hotel also offers web rates including an exceptional buffet breakfast that caters to Chinese, Japanese, and Western tastes. All of the food is fresh and usually replenished quickly, except at peak times. If you have a special food request, it usually can be handled easily.I have read other reviews that lament the fact that the subway is a long walk, however the bus system is also very easy to use as many lines go by the hotel. Most all of the buses will announce and scroll the next stop in Chinese and English. Until subway line 10 opens nearby, take the 139 bus (2 RMB) across Han Dan Road in front of the University, to HongKou football stadium (about 5 stops), and from there you have subway line 3 and 8 to choose from. Remember to bring 1 yuan (RMB) coins as most buses don't make change. Line 8 will take you to People's Square where you can connect to most anywhere in the city on lines 1 &amp; 2, or walk 2 blocks to the NanJing Road pedestrian shopping mecca. If you are in a hurry, a taxi fare to downtown Puxi is approximately 30 RMB and 30 minutes. To the PuDong area is about the same price.Locally, if you walk 1-1/2 km east you will reach WuJiaoChang center which is a complex of shopping malls and restaurants. Too hot or tired to walk, take bus 850 for 1 RMB down 1 stop and you will be dropped off at the Wanda Plaza, part of the mall complex.People have also said that getting to the hotel from PuDong International is difficult. If you e-mail the hotel and ask, they will respond with Chinese instructions on the hotels location for the taxis.Basically, if you are interested in staying in a quiet area and saving money, but you still want 4/5 star attention and service, this is THE hotel to stay at. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Very good hotel excellent service but location is a bit of a drawback. We recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fudan Shanghai and found the hotel to be very enjoyable and the service to be outstanding. The hotel is modern, extremely clean and well kept, with a good variety of facilities. The service-oriented, attentive, and responsive attitude of all the hotel staff was excellent - very commendable. The only drawback I found was the location of the hotel, being well-removed from the core of Shanghai and about 30+ minutes walking distance from the nearest subway station. You basically must rely on taxis for all local travel. While the hotel staff is very good about telling the taxi drivers exactly where you want to go and will provide hotel cards with the location of the hotel in Chinese, I still had a few problems with drivers being able to find the hotel, especially in taking taxis from Pudong airport including one driver, who clearly was completely lost and drove all over trying to find it -- and then tried to charge me 240 RMB for what should have been a 160 RMB fare. Fortunately, the Crowne Plaza staff negotiated with the driver, on my behalf, to reduce the fare to 180 RMB. Overall, it was a great hotel stay, with the only downside being its location. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Good Hotel a bit far from Downtown The Hotel is close to Fudan University in Shanghai. Do carry the Map or instructions in Chinese how to reach hotel. Not all Taxi Drivers know the place, Our Cabby had to ask a few people at the Airport. But we finally found it. The hotel property is good and the rooms are spacious from Shanghai Standards. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Must have been good. At 10 pm the Concieage convinced us that there will be no resturant open in shanghai. The concierge here should apply for the worst in the world. They said ALL restaurants close by 10, 10.30 and we could go to the hotel bar. We head upstairs only to be told they are closed as well. So landed at Macdonald's . The sofa upholstery was not befitting a Crown Plaza. Also learnt that they do not offer lounge access for Gold cards guests- unlike a Hilton. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Very pleasant hotel I stayed a week in the Crowne Plaza Fudan at the club level (15th to 18 th floors. Everything was fine and I had a very pleasant stay. I recommend the club on 19th floor: they have a daily &quot;happy hour&quot; from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm with pleasant atmosphere, drinks and various canapes. Breakfast buffet is gorgeous, service excellent, rooms are clean, chech-in and out speedy and simple. If you wish to avoid taxis (half an hour in no-rush time), there are two metro stations at half an hour walking distance in both directions from the hotel along Handan Road. A huge shopping center, named Wanda Plaza is a the relative vicinity. Nice little garden in the Fudan University campus, just in front of the hotel. Many bookstores and little cafés in the nearby residential area South of the hotel where you can meet students. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Out of the Way but worth it. I liked this hotel. Out of the centre of Shanghai, but convenient for where I was working and a relatively short cab ride from the phrenetic centre. No issues about early check in, having just arrived on overnight flight. Room very comfortable with all the facilities I could wish for - or needed and high standard of cleansiness.Breakfasts excellent choice of east and west included in very reasonable room rate. I had two formal meals- one Chinese banquet organised by my hosts, the other a European style meal to reciprocate- both excellent. Bar prices reasonable.Health club and pool very well equipped and looked after- only annoying thing was requests to fill in assessments of the quality of service from staff on several occasions. Staff overall very friendly and reasonable prices for use of phone and business centre.Check out very efficient. Convenient ATM in foyer "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,fantastic hotel Very modern hotel with comfortable facilities. The room is nice especially the bed. The newly opened restaurant is quite good with the delicious tapas food. I love this hotel. 
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Great Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fudan Shanghai based on Tripadvisor recommendations, and we were not disappointed. The hotel is new and our superior grade room was spacious and nicely decorated. The bathroom was the most elegant of any of the hotels on our tour of China. The staff was extremely attentive. We were met at the door on our arrival and escorted to the check-in desk. We arrived at 12:00 p.m. and were given a room immediately. The bell boy showed us to our room and explained everything about our room including the fire evacuation route! The hotel food was very good although the drinks were expensive. My only complaint is that prior to leaving for our trip I wrote an email to the hotel requesting the concierge to write with directions, in Chinese, to give my taxi driver. I never received a response. Fortunately I was able to have my tour guide in Xi'an translate the directions into Chinese prior to our arrival in Shanghai. This was very important as taxi drivers weren't too sure of how to find the hotel-we discovered this the first time we went sightseeing and got driven to the wrong hotel. Overall, this was an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay there again. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"great hotel We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fudan Shanghai for 4 nights in June 2008. We found the hotel to be great.We arrived from our overnight flight at 10:00am and our room was ready for us to check in. This was an unexpected suprise as it allowed us to have a shower and a small nap before heading out for the day. We had emailed the hotel earlier and had them scan and email the taxi card &quot;please take me to the ___&quot; in chinese. This is something you really should do for any hotel as it makes getting there a lot easier.The room was very large and clean. The bed was comfortable and they also had a pillow menu. The staff were also very helpful. The inside of the hotel was very nice, with modern artworks and interior design evident.The hotel is opposite the Fudan university and is a bit out of the main touristy areas like the bund, however cabs are so cheap it doesn't matter as it only costs about $5 to get to the other side of town.For lunch a couple of times we went to the Fudan walking street - about a 1 minute walk from the hotel and had some wonderful food at the restuarants there.This hotel was really cheap at only around 600RMB from Crowne directly. Other hotels on Nanjing Lu are 2 - 3 times more expensive for a similar quality. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"some rough spots This hotel shows that China has come a long way in customerservice and amenities. There are wonderful features of thisestablishment, but customers should be aware of a fewrough spots around the edges. While the room rates arefar below those of comparable US hotels in large cities,there are a few surprises: (1) internet is exorbitantly expensive;daily in-room internet is 100RMB, about 12 US dollars; (2) foodoptions are limited; the simplest request like a sandwich ora cup of coffee can be difficult to arrange; (3) the lunch buffetis 20 US dollars and extremely mediocre. Otherwise my stayhas been very comfortable. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Great hotel. Fair location. Four star hotel. Great staff, facilities. Only downside is that it's well away from everything of interest and neighborhood doesn't have a lot of character. Factor in cab rides whenever you want to go anywhere. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Really enjoyed this hotel. We spent four nights at this excellent hotel. Our room was large, well appointed, very comfortable and clean.We paid a little extra for access to the club floor and this proved very worth while. Here we had breakfast, checked our email, enjoyed evening cocktails and canapes, and popped in for coffee whenever we wanted. All without further charge.All the staff were always most attentive, welcoming and helpful.By chance we were there for Chinese New Year so had the additional benefit of meeting two dragons in the club lounge as part of the festivities!The hotel is a short taxi ride from the Shanghai Bund and city centre, fare about 35 yuan, and a short walk to a massive mall with every kind of shop and restaurant. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Superb I booked the hotel because I were at Fudan University. I did not bother about the distance from Shanghai city centre but my trips to the Bund took usually 25/30 minutes and costs only 5 euro by taxi. The plus of the hotel are definitely the rooms. Even standard rooms have every kind of amenity, from slippers, bathrobes, bathroom amenities, and balance to office utilities. The bed are very large and really comfortable (true the story about the 6 different types of pillows). Bathroom is very large and contains bathtub as well as separate glass shower. Internet is available in standard rooms but it does cost you 100 RMB per day; in the lobby and restaurant a wi-fi free connection is accessible.The breakfast and dining buffets are above average with wide selection of food, but not top class and quite expansive (dining buffet is above 200 RMB). For eating, there is also a big shopping area close to the hotel (10 minutes walking). Service in all hotel facilities is always remarkable. Indoor large swimming pool and gym are noteworthy (changing rooms, sauna and whirpool in particular). Overall a great and comfortable hotel in the upper range of the 5 star category. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Good Value But Location Inconvenient We had a day in transit and need a room in Shanghai and booked a Club room for about 950 Yuan. The room was quite nice, the breakfast buffet above average, the free internet nice, and the service accomodating. For a night stop over it fits the bill, but for a longer term base for touring the city, we would suggest paying more and getting closer to the town center. It's a long taxi drive into town and IF ITS RAINING AND NEAR WORKER QUITTING TIME you may have a long wait for a taxi --- try 90 minutes waiting in the rain. At least if you are more downtown you can access the Metro which we did on our later return stay at the Royal Meridien. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Excellent value great hotel so so location. Clean as a whistle, nice room, club floor rate included lovely breakfast as well as happy hour which lasted until 9:00 and included alcoholic beverages. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Great Stay! I'll echo the sentiments of most people below...A GREAT hotel!I booked a club-level room, as it seemed the best deal, which gave me breakfast in the morning (sufficient--not outstanding, but good food, decent selection) and evening cocktails and appetizers (which for me is enough for dinner). One of the better values I've had in Shanghai at about RMB1000 for the club level with all the add ons.The room was clean, spacious and offered about 8 English TV stations--more than most places in China. My only gripe about the club level was the lack of free in-room internet--I do expect to pay for internet access, but not when on a club floor, as it's included at most other hotels in Asia, including the more-expensive sister-property Intercontinental Pudong Shanghai. Bathroom was very large--tub and separate glass shower.Service was very good, both on the 'ground floor' and up in the club room. When I arrived at the hotel, I presented my passport to 'Rose', who told me I should check in at the Club Level. Rose was awesome, almost too accomodating...She took me up there personally, asked me what I wanted to drink and brought me a Qingdao beer while another girl checked me in. That was not the end of my 'Rose Experience'. She happened to be standing near the door when I returned from my office the second day--she acknowledged me by name and proceeded to escort me up to my room, all while making friendly small-talk about my day and life in general...I believe the Chinese call it 'Tan Tian', translating literally to 'talking about the sky', or, small-talk. :)The club floor staff was so helpful it was almost over-crowding of me...I couldn't get my own diet coke or beer, let alone trying to re-fill my water glass with ice, and they were there to swoop up finished plates in about 10 seconds. I'm not really complaining, because I never complain about good service!Great hotel, great experience...The hotel is far away from anything exciting in Shanghai, and that's fine by me. It was about a half-hour ride to my office, but worth it for this great property at such a great value! Definitely going to consider it again next time in Shanghai. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Watch your CC statement Extremely comfortable and large beds in clean, spacious rooms. Hotel room rate was good value for money for Shanghai (around 600 RMB) although this did NOT include breakfast, and the in-room dining menu was in my view very expensive. The location was not so good if you want to be amongst the action. A Cab from the Pudong area to the hotel at night cost about 60 - 70 RMB. However, a #139 Bus heading west on handan road for 2 RMB (about three stops) takes you to the very convenient subway station.I was disappointed by only one aspect. The hotel charged my credit card a second, extra amount ($30) prior to our stay, without my consent. I noticed this on my statement, and when I contacted them about it they were, curiously, unable to satisfactorily explain how it happened or what the fee represented. They were reluctant to refund it, and (only upon my insistence) instead offered it to me as a credit to spend on hotel services. Then when we actually arrived at the hotel, I received a different, inconsisent explanation as to what the charge represented. They seemed unwilling or unable to refund the amount to my card, but they ultimately paid me out the cash. Just check your CC statement... "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Great hotel but inconvenient location This hotel is sparkling new and beautiful. The staff and concierge are very helpful and knowledgeable. The price is incredibly reasonable. I booked on the Crowne Plaza website a room rate of 670 yuan per night for a double including breakfast. The breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of Asian and Western dishes. The cafe also offered nice desserts which served as a wonderful afternoon snack. There are other restaurants in the hotel as well although we didn't try them.The downside was the hotel's distance from areas of Shanghai most tourists want to visit. Our daily taxi fares amounted to $20 or $30 a day. Shanghai has a very good subway system. If I stayed at this hotel again, I would take a taxi to the closest subway station in order to cut down on transportation costs. For dining, there is a very good shopping and dining center very close to the hotel, not within walking distance, but only a five minute taxi drive away. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Sensational Hotel Experience A friend and I have just returned ffrom a week staying at the Crowne Plaza Fudan. We stayed on one of the club floors which represented excellent value for money. The rooms are beautiful with THE most comfortable beds. The club floor provides breakfast, beverages during the day and wine/spririts and canapes in the evening. It's quiet and lovely. The only drawback is that the staff speak very little English but if you're prepared to explore Shangahi with an easy-to-read Subway map you'll have no problems. The concierge is your best bet for English speaking assistance. Enjoy! "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Lovely hotel Very clean and spacious room, good food in the restaurant and very helpful staff. Location is about 30 mins from the Bund . Club lounge good for internet access, breakfast ok, nothing special. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Fantastic hotel i na quite but convenient area It may seems foolish to many booking a hotel room near Fudan University, when Shanghai city centre has plenty of great hotels. Yet, this Crowne Plaza deserves a go! It's just 10 kms. from Pudong/the Bund ( a mere 25/30 RMB of taxi fare!), and the hotel is great!The lobby is not enormous, but big enough to accommodate groups. Check in was pretty fast. That's important!Even though we arrived at about 10 am at the hotel, our king club room was aready available. As you can see from the picture, it's a modern, new and arge room, with every amenity you can expect from a 5 stars hotel, including, slippers, bathrobes, office utilities, in-room internet (100 RMB per day), bathroom amenities.The bed was very large, and comfortable! If you have any allergy, just ask the Housekeeping, as they have as many as 6 different types of pillows to accommodate every guest!The hotel opened in June 2006, and in fact it's very new! The Club Lounge - located at the top floor (all the club rooms are located in the top 3 floors too) is large, and the staff always helpful! Breakfast there was very good (buffet style, very good quality); all day drinks available; and evening cocktail hour with canapes (very good ones! 4 choices of white wines, just to tell you something about the quality of this hotel!).This hotel boasts a Beauty Salon/spa (we didn't try it), a gym (very new! Not big, but with state-of-the-art treadmills, step and rowing machines, and three or fours other machines plus weights) and an indoor swimming pool (large and with access to a open air terrace with chairs and tables). Changing trooms are top notch, with sauna and whirpool! Wow!The hotel has a wine bar, a Tea Lounge and a restaurant. The concierge is very helpful, and they booked our train tickets to Beijing easily, fastly and with just 50 RMB surcharge per person! So why go to the train station when you can ask them??Taxis are readily available. The hotel is located just opposite to Fudan University, a quite area with a lot of students! It can give you a glimpse of everyday Chinese life!My only compliant is that the staff doesn't speak an adequate english. It's really difficult make them understand everything but the simplest requests. Anywho, there are a couple of good english speakers, so just locate them and stich to them!All in all, this hotel is very good, some way between a 4 and aa 5 stars hotel And the price is very cheap, compared to same quality hotel located downtown (club room for just 900 RMB/day! Isn't that a bargain??). I'm sure that if you choose this hotel, you won't be disappointed!Rating: A-- "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Great hotel and staff We really liked the hotel, service, concierge services, room quality, club lounge at this hotel. The breakfast was average and not as good as other hotels we stayed at in China but the other things made up for that. The beds were very comfortable. The club lounge with internet was very useful. We were 2 adults and 2 children (11, 7) in one room which had two double beds. The room worked well for us. The kids loved the pool. The location is a negative but the hotel was very comfortable and taxis were never a problem to find. The hotel’s concierge handled tickets for the Shanghai Circus for us. The concierge staff was very helpful in making reservations, providing recommendations. The food mall they recommended for lunch about 15 yuan by taxi was a great place to go for meals. There are all kinds of restaurants here including the Pizza Huts etc. There is a Walmart behind the food mall area too. There is also an excellent Chinese restaurant called &quot;Real Good Seafood Restaurant&quot;. The food and service was very good here. The market price fresh fish can be pricey though it was the best fish I have had in a long time. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"New hotel Great hotel. Very new at the time we stayed there. Staff struggle a bit with their English. Best to find someone who's relatively fluent and stick with them during you time there. Location is a bit off centre, but there are plenty of taxis around (It will take around twenty minutes to the centre of town). The restaurant is a bit on the steep side considering food is quite cheap in China, but the food is really nice. There is also a large electronics mall just up the road which can be handy if you get your camera stolen (like happened to us a few days before in Beijing!). Overall, a good place to stay for the mid-range traveller. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Nice place Before we left, I looked for reviews on hotels in Shanghai. I was left somewhat confused, but this hotel seemed to have all good reviews. So I booked it, and was not disappointed. This is really very good value for your money, very large rooms (deluxe if I remember well), good service, and actually also a nice restaurant. Rooms are clean and have all the comfort. It takes a taxi drive into the center, but the price is low (3 or 4 euro), and the center is not Paris or Rome., so it's not necessary - I would say - to stay in the center as a tourist. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,Wow! We stayed here with our tour group Smartours and it was fabulous to say the least! The only thing that I can say bad is the distance between it and the city (about a 25-35 minute cab ride depending on traffic) and that they did not have anything besides down comforters. My travel companion is severly allergic to down and was forced to sleep with just a sheet because they stated they had no other blankets....but aside from that....beautiful and very classy! 
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Love it! I stayed at this hotel from April 12-14, 2007.Architectural &amp; Interior Design- Understated, contemporary.Rooms - Complete with interent service, comfortable beds, flat screen TV, mini bar, robes/slippers. Housekeeping does a great job!Breakfast Buffet at the Cafe - Good spread of western/chinese cuisine but poor service at the height of the morning rush.Check In/Out - painless and efficient.The only drawback is the location which is at least 20 minutes w/o traffic from downtown. The driver of the cab we rode in is not even familiar of this hotel.This is definitely a 5 star hotel! "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"Wonderfulwonderful hotel This is a great hotel! The best I have ever stayed in. The beds were heavenly; the service fantastic; the executive lounge perfect! Allan, the manager of the executive lounge, was extremely gracious and helpful, ensuring a fantastic stayI doubt i will ever stay anywhere else in Shanghai. Shanghai is a big city. Unless you want to spend all your time in one area, you are going to have to use taxis anyway. Location is not that much of an issue and this hotel provides wonderful value "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"The only thing to consider I can't add much to what's already been said. We had 4 nights at the hotel, and everything (room, food, etc.) was superb. The only downside, as has been mentioned, is the location. And I would say that your choice is between excellent value and convenient location. If you want to be near the action, don't stay here unless you're willing to put up with long cab rides (20 minutes once off-peak; 30 or more otherwise), and the posibility (as happened twice out of 8 rides) that the driver will get lost on his way back to the hotel. It would have been nice to stay downtown, especially when it was so difficult to get a cab back to the hotel during rush hour. It would have been nice to step out of the door and into the shopping/dining/sightseeing/entertaining area. But that would have cost 4 times the amount that we paid ($82 a night, booked by phone with IHG reservations, including a great breakfast buffet.) for a comparable property. The reservations agent told us that we qualified for a weekend rate, which we wouldn't have known otherwise. So, if you don't care about being in the boonies, this is a fantastic value. "
crowne plaza shanghai fudan ,"BEST VALUE IN SHANGHAI I have spent more than 500 nights in hotels in China and at least 50 nights in the best of Shangai including the Pudong Shangri-la, Portman Ritz Carlton, Renaissance and Westin. The Crown Plaza is almost equal to the best and at much less than half the price. I checked in to the Club Floor at 7:30 PM and was very pleased to find their happy hour went till 8:00 PM. Most hotels close their club happy hours at 7:00 PM. The club lounge is one of the nicest and has top shelf liquors and several hot hors doerves. Unlike many of the hotel club floors, it was surprisingly empty and the service very good. The location is not convenient but is worth the savings. One of my taxi drivers from Pudong airport had trouble finding it so download the map or directions from the web site before you go. "

crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,Nice hotel but to be avoided by tourists Nothing wrong with this hotel. nice rooms and good breakfast. However if you are visting Shanghai you should not stay there. This hotel is targetted for business travelers who have business there not for tourists. There is nothing to do or see around there. You can walk to the subway (10 minutes) but the ride to Nanjing Road will take an hour. If you take a taxi to the key places in Pudong that will cost you over 70rmb each time. This hotel is not to be confused with the other Crowne Plaza which is also in Pudong but is better located. 
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"location is a big problem Stayed one night here , 15% surcharge, and needed to pay 98rmb for the internet to check emails. There are many alternatives that are much closer to the city.The location is the main problem, The tea and coffee canister was empty which I am sure they would have replenished in no time. The staff were profesional,polite and helpfull. Room was what you would expect, served a nice meal but nothing out side this hotel in terms of food alternatives or shopping that we could find. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Nice Hotel.... Nice food! This is a nice hotel, located in a clean area of Shanghai.... A supermarket is 5 minutes walk, as is the metro stop, The hotel shuttle will take you to the riverside or underground market, the bus fills up quickly! Rooms are very large, will great showers! If you want to use the pool bring a swimming cap.... They are very strict about the cleanliness of the water! "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Great Hotel for Value My wife and two young teenagers stayed here in two rooms next to each other. The rooms were bright and large for standard rooms. The beds were very comfortable soft not hard as the others we had stayed in during our three city China tour. There is plenty of shopping around the hotel if you want to pick up water or soft drinks during your stay. The Metro is a short 15 minute walk next to the Science Museum. I recommend the Metro for travel it is quick and efficient and will take you to all the tourist destinations for 4 RMB per person. The taxis are great they are real cheap and start at 11 RMB when you get in. We took the taxi one night to YuYuan Gardens for 21 RMB, that's like $3.50. Make sure you tell the driver to use the meter (Fa Bieu). The staff will write down in Chinese and tell the drivers where you want to go. Make sure you have the name of the hotel with you for the return trip. We did not use the amenities offer at the hotel and dined out every night. The rooms are a great value at $136 dollars per night per room. It was still cheaper than staying at a comparable hotel in downtown Shanghai. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Some Jewels missing from this Crowne..!!! When one is travelling to a new country, especially for business everything has to impeccable and done in style.. And, if it's China then a tad bit handy would be a Mandarin dictionary.. Which I didn't carry as a hotel which terms itself as a 5 - Star would live up to those standards..It did somewhere, but faltered too a bit.. It may learn as the wheel progresses.. The catch up line of Crowne Plaza is 'The Place to Meet' - and, yes it does exude a business atmosphere. But, the hotel is located very much at the extreme end of Shanghai.. So, if you are travelling from the Pudong International Airport - be ready for a trip which excites you initially, as you are in Shanghai and every sight is welcoming. But, as you progress and your tired weary self wants a nap - the taxi seat is not the cushion you need..!!Atlast, you arrive and a friendly staff greets you.. A must need to keep your hotel in the niche.. However, some uppity managers may act a bit skeptical although, you have a confirmed ballroom schedule and the business manager has to be apologetic..The rooms are a treat as one gets to soak away their worries and warm their senses in the bathrobe.. As one works on the schedule, breakfast time flies away every morning.. A sleepy walk, but finally a sumptuous and yummy breakfast greets you..The Congee and the Dimsums were my favourite.. The pancakes with honey and maple syrup just melt away.. while braised mushrooms with the unique flavour of China is a must have..Thus, the king-size breakfast sets the ball rolling for the seminar of my company and the staff is really helpful.. Also, the conceirge deserves a pat on the back for the job well done.. But, sometimes the staff doesn't approach the foreign guests as they have a problem with the English.. However, the Hotel lives up to its stature and despite, the distance it is a Place to Meet..Haibo was there.. Who Haibo..? find out.. A blue-fellow who likes to wave a Hi.. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Great Hotel shame about location!!! I spent 3 nights here at Crowne Plaza, in December 2008. What a great Hotel!! Friendly staff, very comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast spread, and resonable price rates (about $110 USD)...this Hotel really is good,,,,,,except it a long, long way from Shanghai centre!!Train stop about 8 minutes walk from lobby, gives a 4o minute ride into Century Ave, for 5 RMB,,, thats excellent value. There is also a Hotel free shuttle bus, that I onl used twice, but it took me to the Exhibition Centre, saving a long train journey, or expensive taxi ride, cheers!!Wireless Internet in the Lobby, or pay as you go internet in your room. I would love to stay here again, its just not close enough to Shanghai for me, unfortuantely. However, it does have the train line at the door, and taxis are always waiting to take you as well.. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Great service and breakfast buffet Great service. Since we were new to this city, we always consulted the concierge who was very helpful. I love the little extras like at night they turn down the bed and replenish the toiletries and drinking water, and fill the ice bucket. Breakfast buffet has very good selection especially the Japanese section and the live cooking. All the wait staff are helpful with one waitress grilling my fish because she could not find the cook. They are eager to please and yet not annoying.The rooms are not tight and the bathroom is nice and both clean. Pillows and blankets were very nice. They even offer a pillow menu to respond to every need, and no extra cost. I wish wifi or free internet connection, even on a limited basis was offered in the rooms. We enjoyed the free wifi in the lobby though. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"out of the way but nice My wife and I were part of a tour group to China. We stayed in Shanghai for two nights. This hotel was great. Our standard room with a king size bed was a very good size, very clean and very comfortable. The decor in the room was nice and modern and the bathroom was good as well. It had a tub and separate shower which worked great for my wife because she was able to relax in the tub while I showered. The hotel was beautiful and the gym was very nice for a hotel. It had a number of treadmills/ellipticals and a number of other workout stations that you don't really find in your run-of-the-mill hotel. The pool looked nice although we didn't have time to make it there. This place had the best buffet breakfast out of all the four hotels we stayed in while in China. Being in Shanghai (wonderfully modern city!), this place definitely catered to foreign/business travelers. It's located in the free trade zone and seemed to be close to many business related facilities, but unfortunately very far from any tourist-type places. It usually took at least 40 minutes to get to any of our destinations.Shanghai was a great city though. It was overcast and rainy, which trapped it terrible smog down on the city, but was still a really interesting place. Given more time, I would have loved to explore more. Would consider returning in the future with no particular agenda so that we could just explore. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Good hotel not so good location. From check in to check out the staff were friendly, efficient and polite. All spoke good English, including those in the Windows Restaurant (no doubt named after its big, er, windows!) where the breakfast buffet was excellent and the other meals I had were also very good. It has the advantage of being open 24 hours, very convenient for the jet lagged business traveler going stir crazy in his room at 2am!In contrast to the light and airy restaurant I found the guest rooms to be a little dark and dingy with rather heavy dark wood furniture and dark cream walls- not to mention the desk chair which was a strange shade of orange.Other hotel facilities include a good gym which is open from 6am to 11pm, a pool and two other Asian restaurants.The hotel location isn't great and it is unlikely to be a location you would choose unless you had a good reason, such as business in the free trade zone across the road. However, there is a metro station only a five minute walk away, taxis are cheap and there is a hotel shuttle bus which will take you to markets and malls several times a day.There are better (and better situated) hotels in Pudong and Shanghai but no doubt being slightly out of the way helps keep costs down and with value for money included in the overall experience this Crowne Plaza earns its above average rating. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Pleasant Stay I stayed there for 2 nights on a business trip.Room are really nice, just a tiny problem on the shower as not well designed so water goes out to the floor.Enjoyed the stay and considering the hotel rate was really a good deal.Nice atmosphere and good staff. Loved the breakfast buffet.I'll definately go back. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"pleasant surprise Went there for a conference so it was a business trip. Hilarious but it was my first time in shanghai and part way through my taxi ride, the driver asked me where teh hotel was!!! ( it was just built a month ago). Hotel was very clean, north american style buffet breakfast was great, didnt really try the lunch or dinner since i was out on the town every day. Room was clean, although shower doors were badly constructed as water just basically dumped onto the floor and by the time you finish theres a flood. Its also out of the way but the city was building a rapid transit station next to the hotel so that issue might be resolved by now. But overall it was acceptable and the price was right. "
crowne plaza shanghai pudong ,"Worst service ever We went to this hotel due to a flight cancellation. The check-in staff told us the room was being cleaned &amp; come back in 20 minutes. When we came back we were told no room was available. When we complained no one now spoke English( even though they spoke it before) They offered us a room next door to the hotel &amp; as It was after midnight and raining we took it. The place was a dump, filthy dirty, no fridge, no working airconditioning, bathroom tap broken, no sheet on the bed. We will never stay at a Crowne Plaza Hotel anywhere in the world after this experience. "

days hotel shanghai ,"Avoid this hotel - it sucks Lets start with the negatives: 1) Horrible Location - construction all around the area, noise and disgusting people walking around, smells bad outside, solid 10 minute walk to the train station, food options are crap (just a McDonalds) 2) Beds - Awful, unless you like sleeping on a rock 3) Internet - crap 4) Food - breakfast selection was small and not good 5) Amenities - No pool or gym. 6) Room service - seems to be closed after 11pm...they told us to try McDonalds. Positives: The customer service was excellent, after we complained about the room they upgraded us to a suite, which was marginally tolerable. I advise you not to stay here, look for a hotel closer to the city centre near the bund/TV tower area. "
days hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel We stayed at the Days Hotel Shanghai in November 2008. A really good hotel, very comfortable and the staff are great. The rooms are really spacious, and the bathrooms are just great - with a bath and a separate shower.We found the glass wall between the bedroom and the bathroom quite funny. We would not have been able to afford this hotel had we booked directly but I do know that the tour agency that we booked through got a really fabulous deal.I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who want a comfortable stay. There is also a hair and beauty salon in the hotel which was very useful.My only problem with this hotel was the location. I would definitely not recommend walking around the neighbourhood at night even though it is right next door to the railway station. It is about a 15 minute taxi ride to the main shopping and tourist spots. Taxis are quite inexpensive though. "
days hotel shanghai ,"Didn't Love It Part of the Days Inn chain, the Days Hotel in Shanghai is possibly a bit more modern and upscale than its North American counterpart; however, the location of the hotel left very little to be desired. Located just north of the main Shanghai attractions (the Bund, Nanjing Road, etc), the Days Hotel sticks out like a sore thumb amongst construction rubble. The closest subway station is the Shanghai Railway Station but the walk towards the subway was down an alleyway lined with vomit and reeking of a heavy urine smell. Our room had two double beds, both firm but comfortable. Bedding was white cotton duvets and the room came with two free bottles of water per day. On our first night, we discovered a huge brown, sticky substance on the sheets at the top of the bed by the headboard. The next morning, imagine our embarrassment when our room attendant discovered the stain and looked at us accusingly! We tried our best in broken Chinese to tell her it wasn’t our fault and that it was there when we arrived. She changed the sheets and later that day, we found the same brown, sticky stain on it in exactly the same location! We discovered that the stain was actually battery acid that had been leaking from a flashlight located just above the bed. We brought the flashlight down to the lobby manager and explained to him what had happened. He said he would call housekeeping to get the soiled sheets changed but no one came that night. The next day, new sheets appeared along with a non-leaking flashlight.Breakfast buffet was served on the 3rd floor and it offered both North American and Chinese selections. We had an early departure (5:30am) and the hotel was kind enough to package up a breakfast on the go for us which included a container with two cakes, a bottle of water, a yogurt and an orange.I wouldn’t choose to stay at this hotel again just because we didn’t enjoy the location. It was dank and desolate. The street on the other side of the railway station looked to be more modern and brightly lit but we never ventured there. "
days hotel shanghai ,"Loved the Food. This Hotel is quite close to Shanghai Station but you cannot hear the trains in fact it was very quiet up on th 12th floor.The rooms are superb with every facility available (Razors toothbrushes combs etc.etc.)The in house Restaurants were superb and excellent value.The Concierge were extremely helpful with booking tours,Taxi's,and an evening show which was superb.The surrounding area is about to be redeveloped like a lot of Shanghai but don't be put off by this.This is an excellent Hotel at a very reasonable price.Mick &amp; Jean London "
days hotel shanghai ,"New and modern Days Hotel is a relatively new and modern hotel located in a mixed residential/commercial area that is some distance to Shanghai's tourist spots like the Bund and the Museum. We stayed there for 3 nights in late February as part of a Smartours group from San Francisco. This hotel is part of the Days Inn franchise.The areas on both sides of the hotel appeared to have recently been cleared so the views from some rooms including ours were not that good. All we saw were plenty of debris but in 3-5 years these areas will have new high rises (same is true in many sections of Shanghai where they are clearing old neighborhoods for redevelopment.) There were restaurants and shops across the hotel including a McDonalds a block away. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood even though some residential areas looked blighted.Our room was standard with 2 full beds. Bathroom was large with a tub (some rooms have see-through baths.) All furnishings were modern including the 27 inch LCD TV and a sophisticated light control switch by the bed. Room had small fridge and complementaries included 2 bottles of water, coffee and tea, slippers, free use of safe and DSL connection. There was a weighing scale (great for checking our luggage weight) plus bathrobes and full bath accessory kit (comb, toothbrush, swabs to go with the lotions and soap). Bed was very firm but OK. Heating was good. Room was comfortable and clean.The reception area was small but functional. We did not have a chance to explore the hotel facilities as we were mostly out on tours. It was interesting that the hotel's top floor was used as storage room rather than a penthouse or a restaurant..Our package included the daily breakfast buffets at the modern styled coffee shop on the third floor. Food was good with a wide variety of American dishes (bacon, sausage, eggs, toasts, cereals, salads, etc.) and Chinese dishes (fried rice, chow mein, pork dishes, dumplings, etc.) with the fruits and juices and an omelet station. We also ate at Ming Garden, the only restaurant in the hotel located on the second floor, and tried a variety of their dumplings and soup which were delicious and cheap ($12 for 2.) The place was empty except for our table and one other table so we have 3 waitresses waiting for us. They could not speak English (as most staff in this hotel except maybe for the clerks at the reception desk and the managers) so nobody warned me about the hot juice in one of the dumplings that squirted and scalded my upper lip (iced it and it was OK.)Because of its location, there was no choice but take a taxi to everywhere. Taxis were cheap ($2-3) but sometimes hard to flag down unless helped by the hotel doorman. Shanghai's traffic was bad and seemed worse than Beijing so a taxi ride could cost more. Shanghai has more rainy days but the hotel provides umbrellas for free use by guests.The hotel's ATM machine did not accept Visa/Mastercard so we had to walk 3-4 long blocks to the right of the hotel past the freeway to find one.All in all, hotel was clean, modern and comfortable and rates are a bargain. We do not mind staying here again. "
days hotel shanghai ,"So-so Stayed here are a part of the Smartours package. This hotel was ok. It is brand new, and to be honest I was expecting more. It is pretty far from any tourist sites, and the immediate surrounding area is pretty desolate (they tore down a bunch of buildings so I assume construction will begin soon to build new sky scrapers). Catching a cab out front was never difficult, and you can always ask the hotel to do it for you. It also wasn't incredibly clean. My pillow had a smudge on it, and the bathroom had patches around the tub and toilet. Good variety of channels on the TV, including about 5 in english. Breakfast was very good, served in a trendy room. They had spring rolls, dumplings, eggs, toast, bacon etc. They did have free in room internet, which was great. "
days hotel shanghai ,"Clean Comfortable...Highly Recommended! We stayed at the Days Hotel, Shanghai in December of 2007. We wanted a decent location near a metro line, to allow for easy access throughout the metropolis. After looking at several hotels near the Railway Station, we decided this hotel was most favorable...and it didn't disappoint. Front-desk staff was pleasant and the reception area very large, modern and clean. Our rate was 400RMB/night (approx. $70.00 U.S.). You can save a few dollars by booking on Expedia. Other reviewers have commented on the general vicinity not being up to snuff, but I felt safe walking around the hotel. I was never bothered by anyone, and those annoying art students/tea ceremony scammers are nowhere to be found in this area either. Bonus! There are a number of small shops, grocery stores, etc. on the surrounding streets, as well as all the Western regulars (McDonalds, KFC, etc.). Rooms were large, immaculately clean and elegantly furnished. I found the beds to be quite comfortable compared to other hotels I stayed at in China and the bathrooms were especially nice after a long day of walking around Shanghai (beautiful tile work and a variety of good quality toiletries). There are a variety of TV channels, including HBO. Free internet access is provided. There is also a &quot;chocolate lady&quot; who will knock on your door around 6:00pm to hand out bite-size Dove bars to guests. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. "
days hotel shanghai ,"A very nice hotel The days hotel is a very nice hotel its still very new ,so everywhere is still very clean.The only complaint I have is the beds they were like concrete, we did ask reception if thay hadsofter matresses in any of the other rooms,the girl behind the desk gave us four more rooms to choose from we found one we thought might be a bit more comfotable but after sleeping on it we discovered it was'nt. The staff were great their englishwas'nt to good but we had no problems, we could always make ourselves understood.The breakfast is not the best I've had but its certainly not the worst.We never had any problems getting to where we needed to go either by taxi or metro which is very near by. "
days hotel shanghai ,"Nice hotel but location not so good When we first arrived at Days Hotel, I was rather worried that there were no other decent looking buildings around us. The surroundings were a bit run down, mostly small local shops catered to the locals. But I must say, our room turned out to be quite modern and was big enough for 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children). We only encountered one problem during our stay, and that was the toilet was blocked for the 1st night. We also found the air in the lobby to be unpleasant. I suggest anyone wanting to stay here to bear in mind that you will have to take a taxi to just about anywhere you want to go. Taxis are inexpensive. Reception employees do not speak good English but are extremely helpful. "

donghu guest house ,"Great Location - Away from busy streets - Just perfect! Arrived on a Tueday and stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in the main building in a huge room with 2 double beds. Beds are indeed hard, but after so much sightseeing, etc. you get used to them. Maid service was great. Never had to ask for room to be made up and the front desk service was good too. Breakfast did not come with my room but I ate there a couple of times only out of necessity. It is a buffet which costs about $15 nothing to write home about. For food shopping would recommend the Parkson supermarket next to the subway stop. Would stay there again in a heart beat. For a hotel room well under $100 it was grand. Loved the fact that the hotel also offered free internet. "
donghu guest house ,"Good Value location and ambience Stay in the original building, no: 1 which has a charming old world feel about it. We were upgraded to a larger room, very spacious and quite elegant, Chinese furniture with 2 double beds. If you want to pay more, you can stay in a really beautiful room at the front overlooking the garden. Bathrooms OK, spacious, a little old but hey this is China and we only paid about $110 AUS a night.Staff at reception were helpful. Take or leave the room cleaning - I think that was the attitiude, a lick and a polish! Hotel breakfast was fairly standard, a mix of local and western food. We didn't try the several restaurants at the hotel. The Donghu's in the French Concession area which was a great location, lively with plenty of cafes and shops within walking distance. The hotel has a large indoor pool and gym, which I'd fully intended to use but somehow didn't seem to find the time. I did find time for a massage at the hotel &quot;beauty parlour&quot; - which had a long menu of curious services - and it was great. Worth the couple of extra dollars over the massage shops on the streets. I'd stay here again because it was good value, was authentic traditional Chinese decor and was in a great location.Oh and good free internet access in your room! "
donghu guest house ,"Great rooms great location Just stayed in Donghu Hotel Main Building. We travel to Shanghai every month for business, this hotel really offers great values for in terms of price/location/quality. Hotel is surrounded by excellent restaurants, and nice streets with small local boutique stores / cafe's/winebars(on Xinle Lu). The rooms are spacey and clean, the main building has a excellent garden, try to book a front on the front side of the building with balcony, You can see the garden. Of course, the hotel resides in a historical building and facilities such as bathromm is a bit old fashioned, but that is absolutely no issue since eveything is very tidy and clean. We travel around the world on monthly basis and we've seen worse hotels in the States nad Europe. DongHu hotel is a great choice! "
donghu guest house ,"Construction noise ruined my stay On the surface the Dong Hu Hotel is nice - large room, large bed, fluffy pillows, new finishes in bathroom. The mattress is hard as a rock but the old hotel has charm. BUT...construction starts under my room early in the morning. There was continuous hammering and drilling. I complained so they moved me to another room. That room was smoky (recirculating other smoker's rooms air) but I decided to live with it. The next week the construction moved to the other side of the building again right under my room. I hear bzz, bzz, bzz, BANG, BANG, BANG non-stop starting from 9:00am. I am staying at the hotel for two months so I ask to speak to the manager. The manager doesn't really address my complaint , looks at his feet , mumbles sorry and says the noise will stop. The noise doesn't stop but continues for another hour until I decide I can't take it anymore and leave my room. It doesn't really bother me this isn't the fanciest place but the unresponsive attitude regarding unacceptable conditions really got to me. Also the &quot;fitness center&quot; has only one exercise bike that no one knows how to use. "
donghu guest house ,"Great value and excellent room in Bdg 1 in the French concess We arrived late and were expected and shown to our room within minutes - a suite overlooking the front garden in Building 1 - at a bargain price. Spacious and well furnished with hard wire internet connection. Walking distance to great shops and easy walk to Metro - anyway a taxi to the Bund is only a couple of US dollars. Good choice of restaurants in easy walking distance and the streets felt very safe...but watch out for bicycles coming from every direction!Really pleased with this hotel, but can understand other comments form people in some of the other buildings which front on to the street as far as we can see.Staff were efficient and friendly. "
donghu guest house ,"Such a nice place for such a great price Such a nice place for its value! We stayed here for a week while in Shanghai and upgraded our rooms so that we would stay in the Main building. The prices Expedia gave us were extremely cheap even with the upgrades.When we arrived, we were placed on the 5th floor, very large rooms and everything was furnished with polished dark wood. The king size bed was so comfortable we often slept in without meaning to. We had large windows along two of our walls so we had plenty of light unlike the hotels throughout the rest of our trip. The hotel itself was furnished in the same style and very elegant.We would definately come back to this hotel again if we ever get the chance!The people at the front desk were not the most helpful so make sure you have done enough reserach on your own.Located conveniently in the French Concession so lots of interesting buildings to look at while you wonder. "
donghu guest house ,"Cordial Staff and Reasonable Hotel A nice enough hotel, with a very friendly staff. Be careful on the room selection. The newer addition to the original building (bldg. 1) is very noisy, with thin walls, and loud plumbing and creaky floors. The original building is solid and very nice. "
donghu guest house ,"Overrated This was the most expensive hotel we stayed at during our two week holiday in China and unfortunately the most uncomfortable. The mattress was old and sagging; the room was small, dark and noisy. One redeeming feature is the excellent Japanese/Korean restaurant. Worth visiting for the food and architecture but don't bother to stay the night. "
donghu guest house ,"Garden-like feeling in bustling high rise Shanghai We stayed in Building 1. There are a series of neighborhood buildings, ours being the most charming. We had a second floor room with a couryard view. Large room high ceilings, Chinese decor in room, with added glass sun room thru the sliding doors. I would have preferred a sofa or club chairs in this sun room as I found it unusable with only a wood table and stools, screen, and large chest. Friends of ours had a room on 5 and they had an open terrace with city views, one might ask for that floor or view. Our bathroom could have used remodelling but our friends room on 5 had new fixtures, a black marble vanity. very generous toiletries and amenities in the bathroom on a tray. Obligatory chinese electric tea kettle in room for instant coffee or tea which is supplied. A caution on the black coffee maker on the counter tho as they consider it mini bar usage and will charge you 18 yuan a day if you use it. Generous breakfast buffet with Asian and Western items. But don't forget to bring your meal voucher with you or they won't let you in ! Very limited seating in lobby, -- Don't sit in coffee bar area in lobby with out ordering or the attendant there will order you to leave ! Very rude, I thought ! A good alternative to Shanghai high rise hotels and a good neighborhood for walking shopping eating. "
donghu guest house ,Very beautiful hotel with nice service and bright smile. I have been to Shanghai many times and to be in hotels but Donghu is one of the best hotel I have ever been stayed. Overall experience - very satisfied. 
donghu guest house ,"Stayed across the street The Donghu owns several buildings on this block. One of them is the large luxurious boutique hotel to which it seems most of the reviewers are referring. We stayed at another, which seems to be more targeted towards domestic travelers. I wanted to stay near HuaiHai Road because in the past that's always been my favorite part of town. I used to love how quiet the neighborhood was, the small shops, cafes, and boutiques. Boy have things changed. Well, first about the hotel. We paid about $45/night for the place, so overall I think we got a nice value there. The lobby was small, but professional staff and very friendly. The hallsways were narrow with low ceilings, and the room was quite small-- just big enough for a full sized bed, and small desk table. Flat screen TV on the wall because honestly I don't think any other TV would have fit. Tiny bathroom walled off from the rest of the room with frosted glass was an interesting feature. All in all for the price and for Shanghai I think it's not a bad choice. Now for the neighborhood... I can't say how disappointed I was at the way this area has changed over the past 5-6 years. I went out one evening in search of some fruit and juice, and found nothing by Irish pubs, western dance clubs, and high end boutiques (Coach, Bulgari, Rolex, etc). Was I still in China? Hard to tell. Late night club music permeated the air, and various stragglers and hangers-on permeated the streets. Really disappointing. Anyway, I'll rate it 3-stars since the Hotel itself was a good deal, and the luxury wing did look pretty nice. "
donghu guest house ,"Charming hotel in the French Concession! Just returned from 9 fabulous nights at the Donghu. We had done lots of research and the hotel more than exceeeded our expectations. The rooms are all quite different so it is a good idea to check the room out first. The hallways and public areas are filled with antiques and historic photos of Shanghai. The staff were very helpful, friendly and spoke English. The grounds are beatifully landscaped and well maintained. A large breakfast buffet with about 100 items is available daily. We enjoyed tasting lots of new dishes while we read the complimentary Shanghai Daily News. I am so glad we were staying at the Donghu because it is one of the most classic and charming hotels in Shanghai with all the modern ammenties. "

donghu guest house ,"Donghu Hotel: 2 to 3 star experience We chose the Donghu Hotel in the French Concession after traveling outside of Shanghai, and after having stayed in a luxury hotel on Nanjing Road. The primary consideration was to be in a less congested area and Donghu was perfect in terms of location. There are many boutiques and restaurants in the area surrounding the hotel.However, the state of the room was sub-par. I read many reviews of hard beds and we experienced it at Donghu. The bathroom set up was okay but there was black mould around the shower stall. The carpet did not look like it was hoovered once during our stay and on one side of the room, there was a gap between where the carpet ended and the wall. The walls were also extremely thin that each time our neighbor's bell was rung, we got up to answer our door. We were too tired to change hotels and suspect that if we had booked a more expensive room (there are many categories at varying price levels), we would have had a much better experience. That said, the staff were polite and tried to help when they could. This property is very much a Chinese-standard rather than an international-standard hotel but if you are not looking for luxury, it would be a fair choice given the surroundings and the polite service. "
donghu guest house ,"Great hotel would stay here again. We stayed at this hotel through a conference my husband was attending. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable, and the service excellent. Breakfast selection was good and included both Chinese and Western style selections. The Donghu is located in a nice neighborhood, and required a cab or subway ride to most sights in Shanghai. This is not uncommon though as Shanghai is a huge sprawling city. Cabs are cheap, and there is a subway stop near the Donghu, but we didn't use the subway ever. Internet access was better than most in China, and also allowed more websites; the general public has less access, and we figured the hotel has increased access because of the large number of foreigners. I would definitely stay here again. "
donghu guest house ,"Donghu Hotel - French Concession-Shanghai Just had the privilege of spending 14 days in Shanghai,more particularly at the Donghu Hotel,which is in the French Concession area.Whilst the hotel is not in the glitzy upmarket high rise stakes,we found it to be very comfortable,large rooms,good views of trees,old building and highrises in background-great blend- and it was very quiet.Everything worked and the staff were very accommodating and friendly.This was the No1 building so can't speak for rest of complex.The area was marvellous,lots of little parks,great tree lined streets and busy bustling Huaihai Road round the corner if one is a shopper and wants to do labels or any other shopping .Metros 5 minutes away-but walking to Bund was easy 5k stroll.Think Bund highly overrated and very glad we didn't stay in that area..Lots of good and varied restaurants about.We enjoyed Shanghai far more than we could have imagined and look forward to re-visiting.Leaves Hong Kong for dead.

Nevertheless, its this same hotel, I'm referring to.Stayed here for 3 nites during Sep 2007. It's a cosy boutique hotel, done up in a classic look. Not hip or trendy kind of classic, more towards a basic old fashioned ambience. Thought it could do with a bit more stylish trimmings. Rooms may look a bit barren to some but very clean though. Service by staff was good and I have no complains there.Location is excellent within walking distance to shopping at Huaihai Rd and lotsa food places. Close to French Concession area, which I really like. For its price, its a great hotel for those who prefer a boutique environment. I would stay there again. recommended, "

It's located in a very vibrant, active and eye opening but friendly and safe neighbourhood. Be adventurous, walk outside of the wrought iron gates and experience the every day life of your Chinese neighbours going about their daily business - especially in the early morning!As for the hotel itself, I have to admit that it wasn't the 4* hotel I was expecting for the price it was charging. A lot of the rooms were under renovation.The first room I had was extremely small, the tap fell off in my hand the first time I turned on the water. I was transferred to another room because they couldn't fix the tap for a day or two. The second room was a bit bigger but the whole time I was at this hotel, the carpet was not cleaned even once - there was lint, threads and other debris all over the floor. The second day, I returned to my room after a meeting and my room hadn't been cleaned at all. I found the housekeeping staff in the hall and asked them to clean it. I was informed that I must put the 'Please make up room' sign on the door knob. There wasn't one! I had to call the Front Desk a couple of times to get bottles of water, coffee and also toilet paper. There was no alarm clock in the room, which is a basic need for travellers though this is not considered a high priority for the Chinese. The staff in the Business Centre could not understand basic English, perhaps the regular girl was off or on a break? However the Front Desk staff was more than proficient.It's unfortunate that this 4* hotel didn't live up to its reviews. I've been in the hotel and tourism industry for over 25 years, and have seen wonderful 4* hotels.Note: If you have the desire for other than Chinese food, there is a great French Bistro (Des Lys) with a Table d'Hôte menu for 48RMB just behind the hotel.

donghu guest house ,"Would Definitely stay at the Donghu again! We stayed two nights at the Donghu in Shanghai after staying at another four-star hotel in nearby Suzhou for a week. We knew the hotel in Suzhou (Bamboo Grove) was well-rated by Chinese standards so after such a pleasant stay we were bracing ourselves for a come-down at the Donghu Hotel; but we were very pleasantly surprised.We called ahead to ask for a room in the old part of the hotel (as opposed to the new block across the road, seemingly more anonymous) and were indeed given an enormous, clean and nicely-furnished room in the traditional style part of the hotel. The bathroom was large and fully-functioning, the bed huge and comfortable, and whilst the room was only on the second floor and overlooking the street, we were not disturbed by noise: as other reviewers for this hotel have noted, it is in a quiet position in a leafy, pleasant area of the city so traffic blare was not a problem.We did not eat breakfast in the hotel so I cannot comment on it, but the hotel has a half dozen restaurants and bars (including a Japanese restaurant). The location was superb for walking out into the heart of Shanghai. There were plenty of eating places to choose from in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and a pub and some smart restaurants next door to the hotel. A 10 minute taxi drive got us to the old part of Shanghai for a great day's shopping and sightseeing.Turn left out of the hotel then left again; there is a Metro stop just five minutes' walk away. This is the same line that will get you to Renmin Square, amongst other places (Line 1).For a spot of shopping right around the corner from the hotel, turn right then wander around the streets behind the hotel; there is an incredible array of small boutiques and some trendy bars if you're after a coffee.All round this is a great hotel in an unbeatable location, particularly if your time in Shanghai is at a premium and you don't want to waste a lot of time getting around town. The staff were friendly and spoke reasonable English. The room was spotless. The bed was comfortable. No noise disturbance. We could not have asked for more (especially at the price!) "
donghu guest house ,"A great hotel in a great neighborhood! I stayed at the Donghu Hotel in July of this year, and it was a fantastic choice for a Shanghai hotel. The hotel itself is spread out over several buildings on either sides of a street. Be sure to ask for a room in the Garden Building, as the building has loads of character and the rooms are very quiet. I booked the smallest room possible, and it was more than adequate for one person. The rooms are immaculate, modern, and well decorated. I was in a room at the end of a hallway, and my bathroom was huge! Nearly as big as my Tokyo apartment. Lots of free water every day, coffee machine in the room, and loads of fresh towels. My two friends booked a room with two king sized beds, and their room was massive. Two large beds, plus a huge 'porch' with windows looking over the garden and big comfy chairs for lounging.The staff spoke English fairly well - we didn't have any problems and we certainly don't speak any Chinese! The hotel is located in the French Concession, a lovely leafy neighborhood that is great to return to after a day of strolling about the city. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel so cannot vouch for them. Be sure to pay a visit to the Dragonfly Spa, just across the street from the hotel - it's a Western-style, modern spa - cheap and pure bliss! "
donghu guest house ,"Great hotel in even better location The Donghu Hotel is a lovely historic cluster of buildings located in the French Concession area of Shanghai, China. The lowest price room was too smalll, so when we got there we asked for one upgrade. The next level was fine, though a little small. Our room was nicely appointed and bottles of water were supplied daily free of charge. The beds are hard, as are all the beds we slept on in China, with the exception of the Shangri-La in Hangzhou. Every direction we walked from the Donghu was interesting. Less than a block away was an &quot;old ways&quot; market street with tiny stores open to the street selling all manner of food and goods. One had very good steamed buns, fresh every day and cost pennies. The staff at the Donghu was helpful, though their English was a little rough at times. "
donghu guest house ,"peaceful oasis In the hustle and bustle of Shanghai with motorbikes on the sidewalks and cars driving through every red light - the Donghu hotel offers a peaceful oasis.Great location in the French Concession, although the Fake market at the end of the road closes down at the end of this month and relocates (still not known to where).We stayed in the garden style hotel, which is slightly more expensive but much nicer than the modern apartment block across the road which lacks personality and style.Breakfast in the hotel looked a little dodgy, but just up the road is Elements Fresh - an excellent breakfast place on the 4th floor, (outdoor roof terrace on 5th floor).The hotel staff were very courteous and friendly. The room service food was cheap and excellent. The TV had HBO channel for nonstop films (for when exploring Shanghai became too much), rooms were large and clean and the beds were comfy.I also stayed at the 5* JW Marriott the week before and although not comparable, the Donghu does offer a pleasant taste of Shanghai if you are watching your budget. "
donghu guest house ,"Great Experience I sayed five nights here in May 2006 and had a great experience. I got one of the lower end rooms (about $65 per night), but rooms are mostly high end. It has a great location in Luwan/French Concession and is near the knock off market (soon to be closed), shops and restraunts, and a nice park where I often got up early to watch the older folks do their morning excersises. It is also near the subway system, so getting around is very easy by underground or by taxi. The thing I appreciated most is that after a busy day it was QUIET at night; the beds were also comfortable, a big plus in China. The staff spoke good English and were always pleasant and helpful. Did not try the food establishments; there is a gym which is mediocre, though there is an indoor pool which seemed quite nice. My room was on the small side, but compares well with the size of what you would get in say, Hong Kong. I would stay here again without hesitation. "

four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Cold and arrogant staff in a great city. The hotel is nice, not as nice as it's sister property (Sheraton) just behind, but the staff at the Four Points can be summed up as being COLD! I am not sure if it was due to the weather, me being a foreigner or just them having a bad day. They lacked smiles, they never really greeted you upon check in. More like a factory producing widgets, in this case, giving rooms to the people that walk in with or without reservations.Don't get me wrong, after you check in it goes up hill, entering the corner room with a view of both PuDong and the Bund, unfortunately the SMOG (no fault of the hotel this time) did not do justice to the view that could be had! The location is about a 20 min taxi ride out of PuDong, and the subway system is a 5 min walk from the back door (facing the Sheraton) - for the mobility challenged, be warned, there are no escalators or elevators on the hotel side, I only saw an entrance on the other side of the road.The rooms are well furnished, I had a deluxe suite with 1.5 washrooms (and no goldfish bowl shower/ bath tub setup). There is an in room safe which I suggest everyone to use while traveling anywhere that offers one, not just here.As for the hotel, there is no exec lounge, so for those looking for lounge access, not available, the gym is a basic setup (no pool), and free Wifi in the lobby. I suggest anyone looking to use to sit near the back door as there are tables setup and 1 workstation available for those that did not bring their own PC.Now the food... the cafe on 2. I hit this place for the breakfast buffet. Service... very bare bones, never asked for coffee/ tea, and when I asked for black tea, they said they did not have any and only said chinese (yellow label tea), the coffee you can skip, yes they use a fancy grind and brew per cup but the coffee sucks and only luke warm at best! The coffee in room is 100X better tasting and HOT! As for food, you can skip the hot soy milk, it was burnt both days and I did mention this to the waiters and they only said it is like that... BURNT soy milk? maybe it is an acquired taste to the local shanghainese, not to us foreigners. the omlette station only makes one type of omlette and one type of egg preparations so save your breath with saying vegi/ egg white omlette, you will get a fully loaded omlette, and for the sunnyside lovers, it will always be over easy, no matter how many times you tell them, DO NOT FLIP THE EGG! Maybe it is my accent they do not understand. They are very slow to replenish the food stations. The second say, I did give up and just left to get a big breakfast from McDonald's as the coffee there was hot and the food was the same quality (not good but will do the job in a pinch) I would expect all over the world and not from an international hotel's restaurant. Maybe I am just picky or I woke up on the wrong side of the bed but I find there is a lot of room to improve or maybe this was a Corporate request to drop down their service level as they would be directly competing with their 5 star sister property behind them???I will book the Sheraton next time as the price was only 10% more but the facilities when I toured justified the difference. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Beautiful hotel 29 floors with panoramic restaurant at the last one central position, close to metro, 10 minute walk from Financial Centre.free internet in the lobby, big room, king size double bed! "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Reasonably good hotel I have stayed in this hotel half a dozen times during the past 2 - 3 years. I was surprised reading the kind of negative reviews prior to my latest stay and I was a bit worried when arriving.Fortunately I had a very pleasant stay, perhaps better than any of my previous stays. Also this time, my room was very nice and clean. Some staff was like in any other Chinese hotel and the most of them were very nice and polite.I would like to recommend the restaurant at the top floor. Usually I do not eat at the hotel restaurants, but this time and during my previous stay I had to do so due to my schedules. The noodle lunch is of excellent value and the great view is a bonus. The evening &quot;buffet&quot; is worth every RMB. It has nothing to do with the European &quot;buffet&quot; with tired food. For a fixed price you can eat as much as you want many types of Asian food: sushi, teppanyaki, noodles, ..... Everything is prepared on order and served to your table.The location is not perfect for a tourist, but the transportation in Shangai is very inexpensive. For airport transfer I would recommend taking the maglev-train. It takes about 10 minutes from the train station to the hotel. Based on experience, the train + taxi is faster than taxi from the airport. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"stay away you can do much better at other hotels in Shanghai I come to Shanghai on business often and have stayed at other starwood brand hotels. This time my spouse was joining me for a mini long weekend in Shanghai. This is the first time for me to stay at Four Point Sheraton Pudong. I Very disappointed by how poorly trained the front desk staffs of this hotel is trained and how poorly they treat their guest. I'm a gold member of Starwood program and have stayed at many of its hotels in US and China. The person who checked me in argued with me about my reservation and acted like he was doing me a favor for upgrading me to a room class that I booked online. The room was small even though it was the deluxe size, hate to see what the regular size room look like. The only starwood hotel that I'm being charged for using the sauna. The gym is small and poorly equipped. Though there were many choices for breakfast, food quality is way below standard and some just plain bad even for chinese hotel food. I travel extensively for business and this is by far the most disappointing experience I have for being a part of the sheraton brand. Stay at the Four Point Sheraton Daning, you will get much better quality of service and comfort all around at a better price. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"4 points upon 10 Having had great experiences with other Starwood hotels, we wanted to choose a Starwood hotel for our first trip to Shanghai to ensure a great trip. We decided to try out Four Points by Sheraton as it was new to us. The experience turned out immensely disappointing.Service:Service fell sharply of the upscale image the chain would like to project.No doorman or porter greeted us when we first entered the hotel. It felt like the hotel had recently underwent a retrenchment exercise; besides the three counter staff, there was no one else to be seen. At the SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) counter we were served by a moody-faced girl who looked absolutely unhappy to be at work. She was not very competent in English so we switched to speaking Mandarin to hurry along the process. She was not only unappreciative, her attitude got worse.We were surprised by the large sum of deposit we had to give (CNY1500; we were only in Shanghai for 3 days and thus did not bring along a lot of cash), and after we had given the deposit we contemplated using a credit card instead. The girl made a big show of tearing up the receipt she had issued for the cash and had a look of extreme annoyance. We quickly realised we had forgotten our credit cards, and at this point she had forgotten all manners and threw the new receipt she had written without even looking at us. Seeing there was no manager around and also that we were on a tight schedule we did not pursue this appalling incident, but it had left us with a dismal first impression of Four Points Pudong.Throughout our stay, most of the staff we encountered appeared to be in a hurry and behaved as if we were in their way. They do not seem to realise that hotel guests are the very reason for them having their jobs. Out of the 15 or so staff we encountered during our stay, only the 2 concierges, the chambermaid and our checkout staff were pleasant. Rooms:The room was relatively modern and clean, possessing all the fittings expected of a Starwood hotel. The neutral theme was aesthetically pleasing. One nice touch in particular was the french press. The King standard room we received differed from the one shown on the website. Instead of the modern bathroom with a window to the room, we had a normal separate bathroom (with tub). Also, there was only a small armchair instead of a sofa (I supposed one person was expected to enjoy their coffee on the bed). The window was tiny, no bigger than two pieces of A4 paper, which rendered being on a higher level (16th) pointless. Overall, while not greatly detrimental, it was slightly disappointing as I had preferred the look of the room presented on the website. Pluses were the comfortable bed, 2 of 2 types of pillows, large tv (with foreign channels such as TV5 Monde &amp; BBC), and the lovely plaid carpet. One additional point to note is that the water temperature in the bathroom takes 5mins to adjust, so be careful with setting it too hot.Location:I can't imagine this place being a good location for anyone. While there was a metro stop (Tangqiao, line 4) right outside the Sheraton next door, it will take a minimum of half an hour to get anywhere one would possibly like to visit in Shanghai -- considering that the metro for this line generally took 10mins to arrive. Additionally, service on this particular line (and other newer lines) ended pretty early, around 10pm. Cab rides were faster but as you might know, cabs can be scarce when you need them the most and traffic can be horrendous in Shanghai. Cab fare from the Bund to hotel was about CNY25; CNY14 from Times square.The hotel area was quite gray and honestly not an area I would want to venture about alone. There was a 24h McDonald's right opposite the hotel, a beef noodles place and a convenience store, but that was about it. The entrance of McDonald's was crowded with pedicabs and their drivers -- who tried to cajole anyone within earshot into taking their pedicabs.We had flown in from Guangzhou so we arrived at Hongqiao Airport. While there was no fancy Maglev, we were able to take a public bus (938, alight at stop #15 Ningyang Road) which costed merely CNY6 per person and was a nice way for a first look at Shanghai. The ride took about an hour in good traffic. While the bus was not very clean (I feel confident in saying the curtains have not been washed in at least 5 years), it was still decent and the lady bus conductor was warm and helpful -- informing us personally of our stop and pointing the way to our hotel. Walking distance from stop to hotel was less than 5mins even with luggage. We also tried out taking the metro (alighting at Beixinjing and then taking a short, CNY21 cab ride) to Hongqiao Airport -- it was very inconvenient with the interchanges when you have luggage (at 1 of the interchanges we had to walk about 5mins to get to the relevant line).Cleanliness:Hotel and room were both very clean. No faults here. We had left our pajamas on the chair, and upon our return found them neatly folded by the chambermaid. Sadly this was the only hint of Sheraton hospitality throughout our 3-day stay.Value:If one were able to get an excellent deal during off-peak season and were solely interested in having a room to stay in, this hotel would perhaps be considered to be of good value. Taking into consideration the poor service and location, personally we felt this hotel to be of poor value -- especially for a Sheraton. Overall the experience feels 4 points all right -- upon 10. Definitely would not consider staying here again. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Very comfortable rooms One cannot fault the rooms of this hotel. They are very modern and everything you'd expect of a Sheraton. The views are fantastic, too. Breakfast is a reasonably good mix of Asian and Western choices.The location is not ideal if you need to be downtown as the traffic is horrendous. However, there is a very good metro next to the hotel which is extremely easy to use, clean, safe and reliable. "

four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Four Points Shanghei We stayed here 10/29/08 for 2 nights. The hotel is in the new section of Shanghai, the Pudong area, east of the Bund. Traffic in Shanghai is horrible and so travel times anywhere is long. The room was spacious and very clean. We had a King on the 6th floor. The Breakfast buffet was very disappointing considering this is a Sheraton property. The Holiday Inns we stayed in previously were much better. For a vegetarian there were only bread and pastries to be found. There was some fruit, and hot meat dishes. Breakfast is on the 29th floor, so there is a view, although very hazy due to the smog. The rooms have French press coffee in them which was very good compared to the hotel coffee at breakfast. Actually the room coffee was very good coffee in general. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Good Hotel with ample amendities nearby Our company sent us there for our annual sales conference and i have to say that this is one of the better hotel that we have stayed in.It's clean, the front desk and service staff are friendly. The ballroom that we had our meetings in are well layout and comfortable.The only dislike i have of Four Point was it's location, it did'nt helped that it was snowing heavily when we were there and trying to get a cab to go downtown can be quite a hassle. Other than that, this is one hotel that i would recommend for travellers looking for a hotel in the suburb area. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Nice hotel Poor location Unfriendly attitudes We came to this hotel on May 29,2007 at around 1 pm. At that time, no one in the lobby helping us for the luggage. When my wife check in for room, she ask if she as SPG member could have a better room, but the lady (NOT the trainee) told her that she need to stay in the hotel 25 times in order to have a better room and then gave her the key card of Room 702. We check in the room and I saw that there are many hairs on the floor, therefore I went down to the front desk to complain at once. Then they put us to another room, No.1616. It is same kind of room as 702 (comfort twin), but different floor and no hairs on the floor. During these couple days, I noticed that most of the staff in this hotel don’t have a smiley face and don’t understand English very well. To be honest, this is the first time we choose Four Points, but I don’t think we will come back again to a hotel without a warm feeling. By the way, I would like to say thanks to Tony, Guest Service Manager. He is the one who can communicate with English. Talking about location, the nearest metro is 25 minutes walk, but they are building one underground. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Very Pleasant Experience - Compared to the other 4 Points Property Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over 2 different stays in May.Public Areas: Stylish/Clean. No pool.Location: Poor but 10 mins taxi ride to almost anywhere.Room: Nice and Clean. Free internet access. No tub but not sure its necessaryService: Prompt but the service industry in China just isnt as attentive and sincere as other leading Asian cities. When I asked for a complimentary shoe shine, the service was offered but the staff who came for my shoes gave me a mean look.I would stay here again, despite its location. My experience at the 4 points in Daning was simply too terrible. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Very nice hotel but location is not central This was a very new, modern hotel with very nice rooms and amenities. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby and common areas aesthetically pleasing. The only negative is that the location is not very central. It is in a &quot;suburb&quot; of Shanghai. There is a busy shopping district that is less than a 10 minute cab ride away. Downtown Shanghai is a good 20-25 minute cab ride away. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Nice service inconvenient location Although the services are basic and not very geared to the foreign tourist, the quality of service here couldn't have been nicer. All the staff were exceptionally pleasant (not true in all hotels in China), and also exceptionally responsive to requests. Nearly every request we had was acted on within 5 minutes.The downside of the hotel is its location. The hotel advertises itself as being next to a subway station, but in reality this subway station hasn't opened yet, and won't open until the end of 2007. The closest open subway station is a 20 minute difficult walk through a heavily trafficked sidwalks. The hotel is also in a commercially isolated area -- there are no restaurants or stores in walking distance of the hotel, making one feel stuck. The hotel is a good 20 minutes cab ride from the Bund. While travel by cab is not expensive, it can be very difficult to find an empty cab in the evening to get back to the hotel.While the decor of the hotel is pleasant, I sense there were some recurring issues with the hotel's physical plant. We had several problems with pumbling (clogged pipes, rattling pipes) occuring in two different rooms. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,Extremely clean stylish facilities I would not hestitate to stay in this hotel over and over again if it were not for the terrible sheets/bedding. They were as hard as sandpaper and seemed like they had never been washed when they came from the factory. 
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"Brand new discovery The Hotel opened doors on May 23, 2006, so everything is brand spanking new, so new it even smelled new. The building used to be the Grand You You Hotel but has been transformed entirely. There will be a Sheraton in the vicinity soon.Welcoming and elegant Lobby, friendly greetings - check-in staff was very helpful and changed my room when I asked for one with a bath-tub.The rooms are well-sized and clean - both in design and as such. Plenty of lights, with an impressive 32&quot; LCD TV, a friendly little sitting area, enough smartly placed mirrors, a truly comfortable bed. The bathroom has a window to the room - which is great since it lets in some natural light. And there is a privacy screen that descends on the push of a button when needed. Another nifty feature of the bathroom: an ambient light that is just perfect at night - enough to see everything but no blinding pain when you switch it on.There are other 'little things' that make the stay enjoyable: two free bottles of drinking water are sitting in the bathroom, and a fresh orchid was placed there as well to bring some colour to the plate, you also have the much appreciated coffee and tea to make yourself. There is an evening turn-down service, the in-room air-conditioning works great, but the floors were at times rather hot during this time of the year..The breakfast buffet is VERY complete and offers everything you can look for in a Western Breakfast with plenty of Asian options as well, there even is a chef preparing your eggs to order.The fitness facilities had a temporary home on the 28 floors (which still needs to be renovated) - but provided enough for a basic workout.So - this is an efficient and agreeable hotel, which was located just right for reaching the New International Expo Center as well as taking a quick trip to town, or the sights in Pudong. All in all, perfect for a budget conscious business traveller who stills wants style and convenience.Only one thing: I was repeatedly charged for items from the minibar which I hadn't touched during my stay. But I was able to sort things out quickly with the helpful staff.With everything being so new, staff sometimes seemed a bit overwhelmed - but once these last growing pains are sorted out, the hotel is definitely worth staying there. The Four Points was a safe, clean and truly comfortable place to stay. "
four points by sheraton shanghai ,"You You So So This modern four-star &quot;business&quot; hotel in Pudong is not too close to anything. However, taxis are both cheap and exciting so that wasn't a major factor for us.The rooms are fairly large and well maintained. The mattresses are too firm for our tastes, but similar to those experienced in two other four-star hotels on the same trip.The breakfast buffet was plentiful in one sense, but repetitive and without too much for the non-Asian guest. The coffee, however, was excellent!The restaurant on the top floor had a great view, although the room itself was too bright, and we dined well for less than $20 for the two of us. The English translation allowed us to pass on such delicacies as Frog Soup in Green Colour and Stewed Pig's Rectum.The bar was a noisy and cramped space that we bypassed. The main-floor restaurant (where breakfast is served) doesn't have much in the way of ambience either. We did not visit the hotel's other two restaurants, beauty salon, or bowling alley. The outdoor pool was not yet open for the season.Lack of employee fluency in English was a surprise to us with so many tourists present, but possibly due to its niche as a &quot;business&quot; hotel. This led to a mildly annoying incident just before we left. A sign in the lobby advertises an airport shuttle about four times daily. Employees told us twice that we did not require a reservation. We still asked the day before departing, and were first told at the desk that there was NO shuttle. The concierge/bellhop desk then left us standing for upwards of 15 minutes before returning with a translation that the 8:00 a.m. shuttle was &quot;booked up. Sorry, have a nice day.&quot; Still, the shuttle is currently 40 Yuan each (about US $5), and the taxi ride to Pudong Airport (PVG) is about $120 Yuan, so the experience was at least as amusing as it was annoying.We stayed at the You You for a total of six nights in two stays as part of a tour package, and by definition it was excellent value. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it again, but it met our needs. "

four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,Very good if you don't mind being out of downtown Stayed in the hotel for a couple of nights. It was a very good and clean four points. The location is out of the center which means you cannot just walk to reach the bussling areas like the bond and nanji st. You can take the metro though (about 2 mns walk) which is very handy and only 3 stops away of the downtown. However the positive thing is that the hotel is located in a sort of a pedestrian area gathering lot of restaurants and shops; quite entertaining and accomodating. Highly recommended if you don't mind taking public transport to downtown 
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Not much for the price Hotel is average, rooms are normal hotel fair, breakfast is normal western unless you want eggs then its beyond their ability to coordinate more than one order at a time, which means long waits. Hotel staff is friendly and the lounge staff is very personnal until the band starts at 8 PM drowning out any attempts at conversation with colleagues or anyone else for that matter. Location is good for transportation ,but the surrounding area isolates you from Shanghai, you would not not you were in China for the Pizza hut, Papa Johns, Burger King, etc all around the property. Overall a dressed up 3 star that is capable of a good one night stay. For longer stays much better hotels closer to Peoples park and the real Shanghai for the same price. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Close to the subway but not to downtown.. At the end of my stay, I had enjoyed the hotel but I was hesitant at the beginning.Starwood advertising this hotel being 1.6km's away from the centre of Shanghai is a bit misleading. I expected that meant I could walk to The Bund in 20 minutes - I could not. This hotel was, however, incredibly convinient to the subway (1 minute away) which would whisk you into downtown Shanghai quickly.The hotel itself is situated in an interesting area. It is part of an obviously new complex that houses clothing stores and restaurants, which is great to have nearby. We ate somewhere in the complex almost every day, and even attended the nearby Circus World performance.The property is very new and therefore very nice. The rooms were very large and comfortable, and even had a *true* Sheraton quality bed that we are used to in North America. Bathrooms were large and well equipped, and some rooms even had nice views of Shanghai's skyline in the distance.I'm not sure if internet was available in the rooms, but there was a business centre where you could pay to use the computer - it was a bit on the expensive side. On that same floor, and in the lobby, there was free wireless.Lobby area was very elegant and nicely dressed up with lots of places to sit if you wanted to use your computer. We never tried the restaurants in the hotel because of what was outside at our fingertips.Overall - a nice, new, modern property. If you don't mind taking the subway a couple of stops to downtown then you can't get a better place with as many options for food. Just don't expect to be close to downtown Shanghai - you will have to plan to take public transit.Also - this hotel is not really that close to the Maglev or Pudong airport. Maglev was about a $10US cab ride away, and took forever in traffic both ways. "

The hotel room is average size, but clean and modern, with overuse of brown tones. The breakfast was included in our rate and was again, average. Overall we were happy with the convenience of the hotel. We recommend it. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Great hotel - we recommend We chose the Four Points at Daning because we could get a great deal using SPG points for 2 rooms.The hotel is located close to one of Shanghai's many expressways, so it was easy to reach from the airport. We discovered the #1 subway line is a block up the street at Shanghai Circus World and that's a convenient way to get around the city. The hotel is surrounded by 'Daning Life Hub'. I don't know if the hotel owns this property but it is a small village of shops and restaurants that cater to travellers. We also found a handy food court on the 5th floor with many Chinese regional venues as well as Korean and Japanese, so finding food was not a problem.Except for one restaurant in the hotel itself (Tias Kitchen) we got very good service throughout the hotel. What I noticed was that the staff seemed to be trained to make us feel welcome. Even the maid would greet us with a smile every morning, and she spoke fairly good English too. The complementary breakfast provided by the hotel featured American, European and Chinese style food of a very good quality.We reported a problem with the kettle in our room. When we returned it had been replaced and a complementary fruit basked was with it. They were also in the process of steam cleaning all the carpets in the hotel (we got a letter to that effect) so we know that continuous maintenance is in the works.The day before we left I asked for an extended checkout on both our rooms. Absolutely no hastle. It was simply 'Certainly, what's the room number?', a few key strokes on the computer, a smile, and it was all done. On checkout they had me review the bill for our daughter's room, then transferred the balance to our room so that we had a single charge to the VISA account. We only had to pay for restaurants, long distance and internet (which was a bit pricey but ok). "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Excellent Hotel I stayed at the Four Points Daning for 5 nights using SPG cash and points. The hotel is still very new. The service is excellent. Checking in was very efficient. The rooms are spacious with two double beds. This is the main reason I booked this hotel for my family of 4. It is a bit crowded for 4 but still OK and we we saved a lot of $ this way (at 1600 pts and $30/night). If you want a room for 4, this is a good hotel option. The furniture is simple Ikea style but pleasant enough.The location is not at the main touristy area but is very convenient. The nearest subway is Yanchang (not Circus World) is only 5 minute walk. This is two stops from the Shanghai Railway station where we took the D train for day trips to Suzhou and Tongli. The main People's Square stop is only 5 stops away. Taking the subway in Shanghai is very easy but transferring from Line 1 to Line 2 takes a lot of walking.From the Pudong Airport we took the Maglev for the experience and took a taxi from the end of the Maglev line for Y160 to the hotel. Going back to Pudong airport by taxi cost Y200 and over an hour.The hotel is located in the middle of a modern shopping complex with lots of restaurants and food choices. We loved the pastries at Bread Talk and Paris Baguette, yummy. Cheap alternative to the buffet breakfast at the hotel which is expensive for China's standard at Y120. The chain restaurant Ajisen ramen noodle has delicious noodles. I miss this already. Another plus for this hotel, is the Shanghai Circus World is only 5 minute walk away. This is the venue for the Intersection of Time show. The show is an acrobatics show with a contemporary style. The show is very creative but the tricks are not too impressive. Still highly recommended if you are in Shanghai.Overall this is an excellent hotel for the value. The location is also convenient with the easy access to the subway. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Definitely a hotel worth considering in Shanghai! My husband has stayed here a few times on business but this was my first visit to this hotel in Shanghai - we stayed six nights. If you are not adamant about being in the heart of the city this is a very good place to stay. The hotel is relatively new, rooms are large, and clean and you get much more value for your money than staying in one of the other good hotels in the centre of town, albeit they are decorated in many shades of drab brown! Breakfasts were good and even better value-for-money if you can get it included in your rate. The concierge here (Victor, I think from memory) was probably the best we have ever experienced anywhere. Extrememly helpful gentleman and nothing was ever too much trouble, follow thru first class. The subway (Yanchang Rd) is only one block (turn right) from the hotel and very easy and most safe to use, and cheap. You are literally 10 minutes from People's Square on the subway. Taxis also are cheap, but sometimes (or, mostly!) the traffic can be horrendous. Things in Shanghai are spread out, too - so what may look close on a map is actually rather far if one intends walking, but walking in Shanghai also is great. The hotel is surrounded by many shops and restaurants. We tried the Blue Frog (already well rated by other reviewers) as well as the 'SouthEast Asia Restaurant' on the 4th floor next door and a Latino restaurant nearby, all good enough. If you want KFC, Pizza Hut or bakeries, among others, they are there too. If you want cheap food and supplies, RT Mart, a huge grocery / dept store next door is great for this, or even just for a look! We would definitely stay here again and didn't encounter any problems except we found the bar rather pricey! "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Loved the hotel!! I stayed at Four Points Daning during my business trip in Shanghai in Sept, 2008. The hotel staffs are very nice and polite. They gave us free upgrade with free breakfast and internet. My room is huge! I loved the breakfast!!!! Tons of choices, both Western and Chinese style! And the gym and swimming pool is nice and well equiped. The only thing is that I wish the gym opens 24 hours. Overall great hotel!The big supermarket next door is very convenient, and has everything! You can get water and snacks there for cheap. The location is alright since it is like 5 mins walk to the subway station, and costs CNY30, about 40 mins (because of the traffic) to Huai Hai Road during the rush hours. I would want to stay there again!! "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Lovely hotel Location a bit out of the way We stayed here for 3 nights in September 2008. The hotel is lovely - its located in a new shopping area on the outskirts of Shanghai. The Metro station is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the centre is really easily accessible. Taxis are cheap but a little scary! No seatbelts most of the time!It really is a business hotel, given its location, and there are probably nice hotels for the same rate in the city centre. However, the hotel is lovely, with big beds and very modern rooms. It also has a lovely gym and pool. There's a supermarket next door with cheap water (its pretty expensive in the hotel). The bar directly opposite the hotel does good food and beers. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Four Points Daning - Excellent but out of the way I stayed in the Four Points by Sheraton at Daning in August 2008 for one week on my second business trip within a few weeks, on a recommendation from a local colleague.And boy am I glad I did stay there! My previous experience of Shanghai was at the Sofitel Hyland (on the Nanjing Road) in June, and to me the Four Points is everything that the Sofitel is not.The Four Points is almost brand new (less than two years old I think), and has every facility that you could require. The gym has modern equipment and the pool area is lovely. The lobby area was bright and clean with very helpful and polite staff, check in at about 1am was done very quickly and efficiently. The rooms were furnished in a tasteful contemporary style, with a large LCD TV. The bathroom (and especially the &quot;rain shower&quot; - what a way to blast yourself awake in the morning!) was excellent, spotlessly clean.The only gripe about the room was that there was a smell of cigarette smoke in there - not strong but as a non-smoker it was noticeable. I guessed that this was going to be a problem at check-in when my request for a non-smoking room was met with polite incomprehension.The breakfast buffet was very good, with a wide range of options, oriental style and western. The restaurant staff were very attentive without being intrusive. We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast, there was a particularly good little bar (the Blue Frog) directly opposite that had a very good range of western style options, and there was several dozen other styles of restaurant either wthin the mall that the hotel is attached to or within a hundred or so metres of the hotel entrance.The local area is both a huge plus and a bit of a let down all at the same time. It really is not a touristy area, like the Nanjing Road is, so if there is anything you want to see it will be a short taxi ride away. But because it is not a touristy area, it is extremely quiet and relaxing to walk around - no hawkers or beggars bothering you every few steps. All in all, if it hadn't been for the smoky smell in the room, this would have undoubtably been a 5 blob score! "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Can't get any more spacious luxurious and pleasant Flawless. The rooms were incredibly spacious and were in excellent condition: clean, neat and serviced daily and efficiently. The beds were comfortable, as were the sofas; and there was plenty of space for storage. Air conditioning was provided in each room with a vast range of temperatures to ensure optimum satisfication for everybody. The bathroom was modern and well looked after, as well as the necessities being replenished either daily, or when necessarily; hence environmentally friendly and not wasteful. The lobby was well maintained and the bellboys were polite and helpful. The hotel front faces a mall, including a supermarket (RT-Mart) and many fashion shops. Shops and many restaurants can also be accessed from one of the lobby escalators. The rooms were secure and access was limited to those with room keys, and therefore those residing in the hotel.The Health Centre was clean, new and friendly. The service there was excellent, and staff would offer the use of steam rooms and saunas within minutes of entering the changing rooms. Lockers were secure, and though there were no lifeguards, staff would regularly look through the window (backing onto the reception) to ensure that everybody was safe. The pool was well lit, warm and the changing rooms were very new and well equipped for guests. The breakfast supplied by the hotel was very good and there was a variety of choices; from Chinese Dim-Sum to an egg station; each day. There would be people everyday offering tea and coffee, as well as clearing away the dishes efficiently. There were many foods to choose from, and each food was replenished quickly to avoid waiting guests. Definitely worth a Five Star rating and would definitely return again in future. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"A truly 5* experience We had two adjoining rooms on the 11th floor &amp; the Shearton Four Points was the best hotel (out of 5) of our entire trip.The pool was nice and clean but not as big as we'd expected. Changing rooms were immaculate and an eagle-eyed attendant asked if we'd like to use the sauna, as soon as we returned from our swim. She even found &amp; returned the hair elastic I left in the bathroom!Buffet breakfast catered to every taste. Eggs, noodles in soup &amp; dumplings cooked to order, steamed 'dim-sum' and other staples, including bacon, sausages, fried rice, wedges, congee etcShops near the hotel include RT Mart (get your supplies from there - DO NOT drink the Evian from the hotel, it will set you back 65 yuan...buy it from RT Mart for only 16 yuan!! You can also buy bread, steamed buns &amp; other ready meals from this supermarket-and-a-half), Toys R Us, Apple, Evans etc. You'll be spolit for choice as far as restaurants are concerned - KFC, Burger King, bakery, Japanese, Cantonese, Spanish, Italian. You name it, they've got it. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Good Start Bad Ending We stayed there couple times in March. I was first very impressed with the front desk and delivery of service request on the first visit. On the second visit, the request for an extra towel was never delivered. Then after requesting of check-out at 12pm granted, we went across the street to the supermarket for couple odds-and-ends items at around 10am in the morning, laying out my handbags and everything else around in the room, thinking that they would not come to clean the room until we check out. To our surprise, coming back in 30minutes, the maid had already made up the bed and taken out all the towels. She said she was cleaning the room for us, and she was there to watch our belongs -- she had not even met us, how would she know who stays in the room. Well, I told her we were checking out at noon, (and wouldn't her cleaning effort get wasted to some degree? -- thinking to myself) All zippers to all bags were open. Luckily, I had my wallet with me. I had taken the passport out of the safe and put in the handbag already -- my fault. Nothing was missing, but I felt very uncomfortable. Upon checking-out, I asked front desk if housekeeping knew that we were checking out today, so that they would clean up the room after we leave. Front desk said yes, which was the opposite of what the maid said. I told the front desk that I did not feel comfortable about what happened earlier, but &quot;oh, well, I am sorry&quot;.I may stay there again, but I will be careful of what I leave out in the room to make me feel more comfortable. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Super Sheraton Collected from the airport and taken to the Hotel after a very long journey.Greeted and shown the hotel and then shown my room which was luxuriously appointed and superbly furnished.Check-in was taken care of in the room and was courteous,and relaxed -just the tonic after such a long trip.That was followed by a long soak in the deep bath in a modern,very spacious bathroom.Then a couple of beers in the swish circular bar - only let-down in the few days I was here was barstaff who were not quite up to speed!!Both restaurants and bar were smart and staff throughout the hotel were attentive,pleasant and welcoming and always helpful.Views from my room(20th floor) were brilliant especially at night.The room was a real peaceful retreat and watching a great selection of football on the widescreen was quite chilling.They also had a very well equipped gym and that was a real bonus to find such a good facility within a hotel.Location too was perfect with either a taxi or subway to downtown,and if not then there was a good mix of shops,restaurants &amp; bars right on the doorstep.Thoroughly enjoyable stay and one of the best hotels I have stayed at.Highly recommended.

four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,i thought it was great This was my first visit to Shanghai and I thought this hotel was great.Fav part was the included breakfast. Great selection of Chinese and non-Chinese choices. I was addicted to the dim sum. And the coffee was great too.The decor in and out of the room was very nice. Hotel was very clean. So much so that they called me and asked why I had my do not disturb sign up for 3 days and asked if they could clean my room on the 4th day. :) Apparently they do aromatherapy in the lobby too.Highly recommend 
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Very Good There are two Four Points in Shanghai and I stayed at both. I preferred Daning because of its better location.This is a new building in an outdoor shopping complex that includes all the major Shanghai chain restaurants and stores. It's like a less expensive version of Xintiandi. It's a convenient 5 minute walking distance to the nearest metro station and only takes few minutes to get to People's Square on the metro. a few notes:- Internet is not free like in Pudong, however there is free wireless internet on the first and 7th floors.- There are NO hawkers/beggers in the area because there are security guards everywhere- The korean restaurant nearby has dog meat soup and it tasted like mutton. - blue frog across the street has a soup\burger\drink lunch special for RMB65 and the burger was very juicy- room service was cheaper than the Pudong location and tasted great- breakfast buffet doesn't have as much selection as other 5-star hotels- bellboys ignore you if you are Chinese, however this is how it is in most Shanghai hotels because their main customers are white businessmen. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Sheraton Daning not very good We booked this hotel through the starwood website since we are starwood members. We thought that since it is a fairly new hotel it would be really nice and also the introductory rate of 688 yuan was very good. Although some things were nice, we were overall very disapointed. I'll break this up into the good and the bad:Good:The rooms were nice and clean (since it was a new hotel). The location is decent in that there are a lot of western (mostly American), and Chinese and Japanese restaurants within the same complex (across the street). However, to get to the main tourist sites (the Bund, Oriental Pearl, etc...) you will need to take a taxi. That can take a while if it is during rush hour and cost around 30-35 yuan.Bad:The internet service is intermittent. We tried to connect several times and were not able to. When it was late at night there was nothing they could do. If it was during the day they would call the IT department, and miracle of all miracles, as soon as the IT department was contacted our internet service would start working. My guess is that they do not have enough bandwidth on their router to manage all of the guests who try to use it at the same time and when we contacted them they kicked someone else off. At one point we had paid for the entire day and were only able to use it for 30 minutes. They didn't charge us for that after we asked them to take it off. BTW, the charge for internet use is 120 yuan for 24 hours.Also, the front desk and the processes need work. We had to ask them to give us 2 keys. Also, even though we booked a king room several months in advance, they did not have that type of room available when we checked in and we had to sleep in a smaller bed. When we arrived there was no English room service menu in the room. I had to go downstairs and ask the front desk who knew nothing about it, then the restaurant who also knew nothing about it and finally ended up giving me a regular menu from the restaurant.Bottom line is that if you want a clean stay for a decent price, don't mind poor service and operations, and don't plan to use the internet then stay here. Otherwise you'd better go somewhere else. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Highly recommend I've been to Shanghai several times and was pleasantly surprised to stay in this hotel. It was opened in March 2007 and still has the new look about it and a few very minor faults (no full length mirror in the bedroom). I would strongly recommend this hotel if you are going to Shanghai. The rate was favourable (less than 700 rmb for a king size bedroom) and it is right next to the metro line that will bring you into central Shanghai. It is also right beside the Shanghai circus. Though the area itself isn't very chinese as such, it is a good introduction for westerners - plenty of restaurants and a few bars. Also shops abound but most are western companies, so not so interesting for tourists. The hotel has a free pool access and lovely changing facilities, though the women don't get jacuzzi access and I found the pool to be too cold for comfort. The bedroom itself is very comfortable and you can stock up on drinks in the next door supermarket (behind the bike shop with the Nike outlet store advertising) and keep them in the fridge. The bar in the hotel was overpriced for drinks, as was the bar across the road (Blue Frog?? or something like this). Breakfast in the hotel was buffet style and had a very good choice. Probably the best standard of breakfast I've had in any hotel in China. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"As Good As Last Time Our second stay in two months (first stay was end May)Asked whether we wanted to become a member of Starwood Preferred Guest upon check in . Told her we have been a member for two years. She then said we could not get points as we booked the room thru travel agnet (also prepaid) which we dont mind. But she would upgrade our room and give us fruit plate (by the way we were asked to donate US$1 to a charity fund at the same time). Fruit delivered 5 minutes after we entered the room.However, dont find the room any different from the one we stayedlast time although we were now on 15th floor instead of 17th floorin May. Room is still fairly new and basically clean and tidy.Free fruits provided each and every day Room keycard did not work for few times. Even the newlyreprogrammed keycard did not work after one time use.Breakfast included in room rate and the food is quite OKA 3PM late check out request was acceptedOverall impression of this hotel is very goodOff topic:Went to Blue Frog Bar/Restaurant just across the street for lunchon the last day. Everything theresis so expensive. Mushroom soup RMB45, Burger/Hotdog in the range of RMB70-80, Coke RMB20. There are many more reasonably priced eateries in the complex so dont worry that you will be stucked "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Not very delightful We booked this hotel using the cash and points program inside starwood with $30 cash plus 1600 pts. It was very strange this hotel has no computer system connecting to the starwood group, so that they did not know that we are elite starwood members. they were very stingy in upgrading us to a better room or they are just not nice enough or reluctant to upgrade us. We were put in to a standard room in the first two nights. It is a 28 sq meters room. We we came back from Nanjing to stay another two nights, we asked them to upgrade us, so we were moved to a 32 sq meter delux room. They also tried to charge us $40 instead of $30 in cash. We had to call the starwood corporate office in Asia to straight this out. The front desk people were very mechanical and not professional enough to handle guests' requests. We only received good services from the bell persons. All the bell persons treated us very nicely and were very helpful.This hotel has only one restaurant and a bar, which we never used. The only chinese restaurant opened in the lobby was not affiliated with the hotel. We used their room services a couple times and it was good. just outside of the hotel there is a huge shopping complex with supermarket, bakeries, and restaurants. The pool and exercises room is a big plus for this hotel. the pool water is a bit too cold though.location of this hotel is not very good. There were not many taxi waiting in front of the hotel. Most of the time the bell persons would run out to the outside of the complex to get taxi for the guests. In Shanghai, it could be very difficult to get taxi during peak hours. Although there is a subway station within walking distance, since the station is in the middle of the subway line to connect the northern shanghai people to the center shanghai, the trains most of the time would be full already when running into this station. We tried the subway once at 9:30 am on a Saturday and we were not able to even get on to the train. Therefore I do not think the location of this hotel is good. Rooms are well equipped and beds are comfortable. there was one room our relatives stayed in was very dirty. They changed to another room later. Wifi connection is free in all public area. one time we found a uniform lady, who we do not believe was doing the house keeping, in our room with two unidentified persons chatting with her when we came back to the room. They came out when we questioned why so many people were in our room why they were doing any cleaning. They said nothing happened and then they moved on to knock on an empty room yelling &quot;house keeping&quot;. We all think that this was very strange and although we had not lost anything, it was highly unprofessional for the hotel employee(s) to do that to the guests occupied room. It seems they do not respect guests' privacy at all. Next time, I will choose the Le Meridien, which is right on Nanjing Road. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Technology Not Suitable for Business Traveler Hotel located in convenient, new area of Shanghai with good restaurants and other amenities around. Access to subway also good.Business travelers should think twice about this hotel, especially those who need access to good communication and internet services.• Internet service is basically unusable. In addition to extremely low speeds, hotel has put &quot;blocks&quot; on normal internet services such as VOIP and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Most business travelers need access to these services and hotel is being shortsighted in blocking them.• Telephone service seems to have some issues as well, and blocks on &quot;Dial USA&quot; services also seem to be in place.• Several dozen TV channels do NOT include either CNBC or Bloomberg - I find this essential when traveling on business and their absence is inexcusable.Management at this hotel refused to respond to these issues while I was staying there.While a good value for a nice hotel, these communication problems make business use problematic.

four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Bad Experience Stayed there a total of 5 nights (2 different stays) over a period of 2 weeks.The hotel is fairly new - 6 weeks I was told by the front desk.* Public Areas: New and nice. Adequate of a 4 points hotel.* Room: Rooms are nice although i dont understand why the bathroom seems to be moldy despite it being a new hotel. I also dont understand why the nonsmoking rooms have ashtray and matches and smells like a smoking room. The 4 points in Pudong has nicer rooms.* Internet: Does not work for people running Windows Vista. The staff worked hard to get it fixed but no luck, even when I returned on my 2nd stay. For a 2 night stay, they charged me 4 nights of Internet access even though it did not work. When I asked to remove this, there was an obvious attitude of distrust. The ensuing paperwork was long. The Manager AND the IT engineer had to be summoned. All for about $30 in charges. 1st time I've seen this type of distrust and inefficiency.* Service: Service attitude in China just isnt up to par to places like Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, and HK. Staff isnt attentive. Staff does not greet guests in public areas.* Rate: They had an intro rate of 660 RMB. Hard to beat.I will not return to the 4 points in Daning. I will stay at the sister property in Pudong, despite its unattractive location. "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Almost 5 star I was a bit nervous before coming to this hotel, my expectation from a Four Points were not high in anyways and nor was I looking forward to the Daning location but the moment our taxi pulled in front of the hotel things begun to look brighter…..Location: Loved it! Not downtown but well located in a lovely shopping area called ‘Life Hub at Daning’ lively (but not noisy), bright, colourful, clean, useful (plenty shops and restaurants)Rooms: Clean, big, well equipped with nice touches. Almost 5 starStaff &amp; Service: Better than the other 5star hotels I stayed in during this trip in Beijing and Xi’anFood: Breakfast a bit average not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. Room service and restaurant we good. Bar was good as well.Concierge: Not the best and most well informedSpa: Wonderful and swimming pool was not too bad either All in all a good hotel and fantastic value for money. It might make you wonder why is it a Four Points and not a 5 star Sheraton business hotel! "
four points by sheraton shanghai daning ,"Delightfully Surprising! I've never had much luck with Sheraton's Four Points Hotels. But this one in Daning Shanghai (not to be confused with the very sad Four Points in Pudong Shanghai) was terrific! It's located in a newly developed shopping area, and is surrounded by a ton of great restaurants and shops. Half the excitement of staying at the hotel was exploring the neighborhood!The building was beautiful...colorful and simple design. The lobby was spacious and modern, and everyone from the doorman to the girls at the check in counter were as smiley and friendly as could be wanted. It's the room though that really made the experience. They upgraded me to a suite (platinum membership with starwood is the way to go!), and from the moment I stepped in, I knew it was my new favorite Shanghai Hotel (sorry, St. Regis!). The suite's living room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The carpet was new and soft, and the window was huge, overlooking that part of the city. The bedroom part of the suite was drop dead gorgeous. Cabinets, LCD TV, king sized bed, and panoramic window all in the right places. The bathroom was done in black slate and was right at the corner of the building, so from the shower or toilet, one could see the city. I'm not good at describing, but let me just say that I was impressed, and I've seen a lot of nice hotels.Brought movies with me to the hotel, but wasn't able to get the DVD player working. After a call to the help desk, a customer service agent came to the room immediately and solved the problem, in the most cheerful of manners. Swimming pool, locker rooms and jaccuzzis, and gym are all top notch looking. Overall a great, sleek property, priced right! Not exactly downtown, but just 7 metro stations from People's Square, which is the center of Shanghai. Definitely worth the visit. "

four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Beautiful hotel - Most comfortable bed Stayed for a week 12-20Nov 2009 with 370 other travel agents for a conference. Hotel staff are exceptionally professional and very eager to assist where possible. Room service food is pretty good - very expensive though! There are quite a few great places to eat around there that are ridiculously cheap in comparison! Breakfast was a bit of a waste of money in most of our opinions - $50AUD for very little selection - again, there are so may places to eat near the hotel. The rooms are very clean but the furniture could use an upgrade. Bed was EXTREMELY comfortable as was the shower. Very quiet - couldn't hear anything in the hallways or other rooms at all. Get everything you can out of the Concierge - they really are a huge help in this city. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Good but looking dated Stayed in Oct 2009 in a superior king room for 1,900RMB. Good hotel, quiet location away from the noise of the construction going on in the city. Nowhere as good as the Peninsula Hotel in Beijing. Only problem was when staff entered our room even though we had a do not disturb sign displayed whislt we were out. The management apologised and did not charge for one night. Good gym, shower and room size is generous, although fixtures are getting old and dated.

four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Oh no! Frankly speaking I was a little disappointed after spending 5hrs in Four Seasons Shanghai. I've my foot broken several days before and that's why I chose Four Seasons as an One-stop solution to spend a cozy weekend, thinking that I could enjoy fine dining service and a well equipped room in the hotel. My disappointment start from my arrival because there wasn't any doorman at the gate to give any help. I have to open the hotel door. The frontdesk staff and the concierge watched me passing through the whole lobby to reach the desk for check-in without providing any pro-active aide. It was not until I raise the request that the staff finally find me a wheelchair, and before that the frontdesk staff was just seeing me standing with crutches during the whole process of check-in. Then when I asked if I could have a table in the steakhouse, I was told that it was closed due to holiday, and how about the japanese restaurant? closed as well. And the in-room dining menu shrunk due to the change at same time. That left me very limited choice for food because there's only one restaurant opened to support such a big hotel. The room facilities were old-fashion as well. Nowadays it's hard to find a non-flat-screen CRT TV set even in a motel in this city, but I got it in Four Seasons. Maybe I asked too much, but hey, it's Four Seasons, somewhere which claimed to be able to satisfied any subtle needs of clint. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Generlly good but not really up to the Four Seasons standard The hotel's generally good but not great. Comfortable rooms but relatively small even according to Shanghai standard. I can never get the water temperature right in shower. The breakfast's OK but again, not great. It's located in Puxi but not the best spot. Service's good, can still address you by name, but not great, not very personal. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"The benchmark They say first impressions are important - well at this hotel they were a knockout. Picture it, a boiling hot humid day and you step off the shuttle after a long flight. Someone takes your bags, another brings a bottle of water while you are whisked over to an effortless check in. All I had to do was get myself up to the room, the bags followed promptly with a smile. From this moment I received only the best in service from every member of staff I came in contact with. You will love the location, the decor, the comfy beds and soft towels. The quality amenities in your bathroom clearly give you a sense of what this establishment is all about. If I had to say anything negative it would be............ummm.....nope, can't think of anything. I hope the hotel reads this and if you do - CONGRATULATIONS! From a frequent traveller, you did a 10 out of 10 job! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Service Exemplified I never bother writing reviews, but am motivated to do so for the Four Seasons Shanghai because they really went above and beyond with helping with me in a tight spot. Without going into particulars, I can honestly say that I have never been more impressed with the level of service and attention that was provided in helping me secure a room and retrieve items I had left behind in their lounge. Whomever I dealt with, I wish I had gotten his name, was just great. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Best in Shanghai for me This is the best hotel for me. Water is clean and not smelly, while I had smelly water in other 5 star hotels in Shanghai before.This hotel quality is really as same as other four seasons hotel around the world.But this is my business stay, paid by company. I can't mention about price. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Excellence throughout From doormen on arrival to departure, through reception, rooms, room service, lounge, all dining rooms and bar, especially concierge staff, this was, over 16 days, an excellent and memorable experience. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Very average property Stayed at this property for 7 nights in March 09 in a Premier room. Pros:Rooms are spaciousProperty is location in a very good area for food, shopping and site seeingLots of eating options near by Pool is over 20 meters in lengthRoom service is good, reasonable delivery time, value for money, and practical menu optionsBuffet in the lobby cafe is better for dinner than breakfastCons:Inconsistent serviceStaff can be surly and not like other better Four Seasons propertiesDeco is room and hotel lobby, bar, gym, pool, etc is datedDust in corners in bathrooms, rooms, public areasPool and gym areas are under utilized as they are 'tucked' away and not easy to accessToo much chlorine in poolAirport pick up service with somewhat crazy driver (other drivers kept honking)Overall, not satisfying stay at those prices. Could have stayed at hotel across the street (Howard Johnson Business Suites) for 1/2 the price and get the same service and amenities.On the other section across from the hotel, land is being cleared and its suppose to be a New World property - keep checking as this location is good. That would be the only highlight of the trip for us. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Loved the Hotel - Not the Location The Four Seasons Shanghai was really nice (as you would expect from a FS), but we didn't love the location and would probably choose to stay in a different area next time. We got upgraded from a basic room and were on the top floor next to the Presidential Suite, so we had a good view of the city. The room was really big and the bathroom was huge, but the TV seemed a little bit outdated. The staff brought us fresh fruit each day and made sure we were comfortable through out our stay.We checked out the gym and the spa and they were both excellent. There's a decent size swimming pool and jacuzzi adjacent to the gym, plus a men's/women's lounge with fancy toiletries, a sauna, and a steam room. The lobby is definitely impressive and has a nice bar for cocktails at night. I used the business center twice while we were there and it's probably the nicest hotel business center I have ever seen.One thing about the hotel is that it's entrance seems to cause much confusion for Shanghai taxi drivers. When we first arrived, our driver drove up on the side walk in front of the hotel before realizing that it was not the entrance. Overall, we liked the hotel a lot, but it didn't love the location. The staff was attentive, but did not go out of their way to do anything special (as I have seen at other Four Seasons in the past). We will probably stay somewhere else next time. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"The Best Hotel in Shanghai The Four Seasons Shanghai is truly an oasis nestled within the concrete and steel chaos that defines Shanghai. This is primarily a Four Seasons for business travelers and tourists making a quick jaunt around the city. The location is excellent, with great shopping and tourist sights a short walk away. The employees' level of English is fair, certainly not proficient, but the concierge is multilingual and eager to help or translate in any situation. I have yet to encounter a hotel in China with a staff of fluent English speakers.The breakfast/brunch is simply outstanding with freshly baked European style pastries, croissants, omelets and other dishes with top quality ingredients. Fabulous coffee, freshly squeezed juices and fast, attentive service. The toiletries are L'Occitane of course and are well stocked and of the highest quality. The sheets are a high count egyptian cotton with a generous down duvet making for a comfortable sleep. Our bathroom was well designed with great water pressure.Spa is excellent. Had a great massage and manicure.The top floor bar is a treat at the end of a long day with a pretty decent band and great views of the city. It may not be like a Four Seasons resort, but it is an amazing hotel. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"One great hotel! Great location near the main shopping street but just off so we didn't hear the noise. Lovely rooms and great staff and the lobby lounge was particularly great- it had the high ceiling so you could really relax and just stare up and dream away to the music playing in the background. I was there for business, so a short trip and not much time in the hotel, but I am sure if I had stayed longer, I could have used more of the facilities. The breakfast was great though- food quality was exceptional and the service staff were friendly and polite. Business center was large and had the separate workstations with individual printing station. Nice magazine and newspaper selection as well. Overall a great stay- wish I could have spent more time there! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great service lovely room classy hotel but so so food We stayed at the Four Seasons for 3 days in November on the following package:Bed and breakfast for 3 nights;Dimsum lunch at Si Ji Xuan restaurant; andSpa voucher of RMB1200 (RMB600 for 2 persons).The room was classy and stylish and the design couldn't be faulted. We loved the bed and the pillows and had great rest every night. Location was good and within walking distance of a metro station and getting a taxi was always easy when we needed one. Perhaps it was because we could speak the local language but we found service to be impeccable. The staff were responsive and unobtrusive. We enjoyed our dimsum lunch and our spa treatments although if it hadn't been for the spa voucher, we would have given it a miss as the prices are way beyond typical Shanghai standards (although very much in line with hotel spa prices). It was our first time at a Four Seasons Hotel and we don't think it'll be our last.We had a few quibbles about our stay though. First, the shower cubicle in the bathroom had a door with no suction and could be easily swung open. Also, the water drainage system in the shower cubicle took a long time to clear. When the two combined, it meant that water flowed to the bathroom floor each time we took a bath. That was quite unsatisfactory.Second, we didn't find the breakfast spread very impressive at all. Selection and variety were small and the quality of food was mediocre. We stayed at the Regal International East Asia for one night and also at the Peninsula in Beijing and both had far better breakfast spreads. At RMB470 for 2, we felt it overpriced - if we did not have it included in our booking, we would definitely have looked for alternatives. That said, Shanghai food is generally cheap anyway so there is no need to gripe about a lousy hotel breakfast; I just thought I'd highlight it as part of the entire Four Seasons breakfast.All in all, apart from the above minor flaws, we were very happy with our stay and the service we received and felt the Four Seasons did live up to its hype. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel but not quite the usual Four Seasons standard A nice hotel in a greal Location of Shanghai, near exclusive shopping, great restaurants, etc. While the building is good, with a nice lobby lounge, good restaurants and nice rooms, it doesn't quite come to the usual Four Seasons standards (especially the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired). Room was nice enough (stayed in centre suite), food at the hotel restaurants we tried was fine too, but service was not very satisfactory. Most of the staff spoke very little english, especially the night satff at the reception etc, so communication was mostly tiresome and lengthy. The hotel also [--] up our laundry on the last day, creating unnecessary stress before departure. All in all a nice experience, but one would definitely expect more when paying a grand a night. The worst Four Seasons I ever stayed so far. Next time in Shanghai we'll be staying at the Grand Hyatt in the awesome Jinmao Tower, which is a gorgeous hotel with fantastic views all over town, good food and great rooms (spent a bit of time there). Shanghai itself is a great city, well worth a trip and with plenty to do for 4-5 days. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Getting old.... The four seasons Shanghai is getting old ! Nice location, great service but room above average.Don't give me wrong... ...it is a nice hotel but needs some work to do... "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Always first class The Four Seasons in Shanghai is always a first class experience. they never fail to meet me at the door and welcome me by name. The rooms are fresh and immaculately clean and in perfect working order.For brief business stays where you need everything to work as advertised and for a relaxing 'homecoming' at the end of a day in Shanghai, it's my number one choice.Keep it up Four Seasons. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Four Seasons is the Four Seasons I stayed at the Four Seasons Shanghai for a 4 day work conference. I found the room to be extremely comfortable (in the same way that the other Four Seasons I have stayed at have been - Toronto &amp; Sydney). The twice daily maid service was prompt and thorough. My only &quot;complaint&quot; would be about the gym - although it had all the expected equipment, it was in a small room (not stuffy - it was air conditioned) without windows. If I was staying for a holiday, I probably wouldn't have cared - but on a business trip, the gym is often my only escape. Overall the food was decent, but it would not be fair for me to judge as my employer arranged for all meals and I am sure that cost was a factor (as well as feeding a large number of people). I did not have the opportunity to dine in any of the restaurants a la carte. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Pure Class Four Seasons Shanghai is without doubt the best hotel in Shanghai.The Location is good with plenty of things to do nearby and within a mile there is a selection of shopping mall's stocking world class brands.The FS is a relatively new hotel that is kept immaculate throughout, we opted for the bigger Premium room and was delighted with our choice lots of space and furnished to a very high standard.The bathroom area in particular was well designed and featured lots of wardrobe space, it is not high tech by any means however it is what you would expect from FS.The Lobby area at this hotel is amazing with a central bar and sophisticated reception featuring some of the best flower arrangements we have ever seen.This hotel although busy had a certain class about it and at no time did we feel uneasy, the staff were attentive and spoke very good english.We dined in all but one of the Restaurants and they where all first class, as was the Jazz Bar on the very top with great views of Shanghai as you sip your champagne a Mezzo selection was available and came in handy after our 2nd bottle.The Spa is very chic, a great selection of massages available and at a reasonable price and the masseurs are all very well qualified.Overall after looking at various other hotels whilst there I know I made the right choice, we nearly went for the Grand Hyatt this was very good but a little to hectic and not in the same class as FS.Overall I expected this hotel to be good because at the end of the day FS offers this across the board in all of its hotels and resorts, this one though will remain very special to us both as we celebrated my Wife's 40th Birthday there.The staff and the manager went to great lengths to make her day a special one from the flowers and cake to the signed card. I even filled out the hotel questionnaire and was pleased to receive a personal e-mail from the manager thanking me for my time.Finally a little advise on tours, we opted for a 1/2 day city tour that covered most of the sights this was great as we had our own guide and Mercedes book this with the concierge at a very reasonable price.A real peace of heaven in a hectic but like-able city. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,Five Star World Class Hotel I spent a couple days at the Four Seasons in Shanghai and was very impressed. The hotel is kept in immaculate condition and the service was exceptional. The rooms have plenty of space and the beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were huge and very clean. They even had L'Occitane soap and Shampoo which was a nice touch. I went swimming in the pool which is a nice place to relax after a hectic day in the city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is planning to stay in Shanghai. 
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Standard business hotel Good hotel for business stays, but nothing more. I liked the location, but the hotel itself is not interesting - very similar to hundreds of other &quot;five stars&quot;. If you want to feel something unique try Hyatt in Shanghai "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Good Business Hotel The Four Seasons Shanghai is a good business hotel; rooms are comfortable and spacious, bathrooms are beautiful, lobby bar is okay, location is convenient. Overall the hotel is not a typical Four Seasons; it doesn't have that contemporary elegence feel, the restaurants and bars feel like hotel restaurants and bars. The pool and spa facilities are nice, but not amazing. The service is up to Four Seasons standards in every way. The staff will go out of there way to help you. And for Shanghai, the views are not great - so if you're lloking for the impressive skyline form the privacy of a hotel room, check in somewhere in Pudong. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,Very nice modern hotel - but expensive This is a a typical smart modern hotel with good facilities and friendly staff. It was expensive and not quite in the centre of the action but a perfectly good place to stay with all the bits and pieces you would expect 
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Service service service! great service I've stayed Shanghai Four Seasons 4 times last year. I'm very satisfied with the room, service and food there. The only thing I have to complain is the coffee is too light for the breakfast buffet. when I stay there last time. I went to 4th floor (swimming pool) to get the coffee there. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Beware if you are organizing an event We held a seminar for a week at the Four Seasons. While the level of general service and quality of food were very high, the audio-visual support was non-existent. Here are 2 examples: When their speakers failed us, the staff behaviour showed their complete lack of skills and could not fix the problem; and while checking the PA system in another part of the hotel they fed the sound into our room while our session was in progress. In addition, the meeting room had horrible acoustics. Finally, the moment our meeting ended they rushed in and removed our tables to prepare for another event. Fair enough -- that was when our booking ended -- but there was no warning and our material that was still scattered around found its way into the dustbins. Not exactly what you would expect from this class of hotel. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"nice hotel but not worth paying the big bucks for I stayed at this hotel as part of a business trip. It was quite expensive. The hospitality was nice. They welcomed me into my room, brought in refreshments and tea. Took the luggage up for me... all good and probably expected of such a hotel. However, for the money spent per night on room, which was more than $200 a night. It was a very simple room. I mean, sure it was clean and comfortable. but I don't see anything too special about it to justify the money you are paying. It wasn't that big either. The hotel itself is nice and grand. the area around it was so so. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great Stay and Good Value Stayed at the Le Meridian, Four Seasons, &amp; JC Mandarin in Shanghai during this trip. Here are my comments on the Four Seasons.Location: I prefer the less crowded location. Four Seasons located a several long blocks off of Nanjing and the JC Mandarin. There's a great local food street on Wujiang Street. About a block a way on Dagu Road you'll find a several coffee shops, day spas (e.g. Dragonfly), and dvd/stores.I thougt the Four Seasons was the good location because it was close to things and subway but still removed a bit from the crowds.Room: More of a tradional room and indicated by some of thecandid photos from previous posts. Very Clean and very nice. No plasma tv but still a great room.Service: I found the service the best at the Four Seasons of the places I stayed this trip. Seemed to me like the folks at the four seasons were a little more experienced. I had issues with a slow drain in the Four Seaons. Some came up and fixed it immediately. Four Season concierges were very helpful. Breakfast &amp; Fitness Room: Breakfast was similar asian breakfast. Solid.Cost/Value: Four Seaons ran a buy 2 days get one day free special in July through its website. Cheapest room was 1900 RMB/night w/ breakfast. Factor in the free day. It was a great deal. For a late night snack near the Hotel, walk to Wujiang street, wait in line and try Yangs Fried Duplings. About 3RMB per order. Cheap!Overall great stay. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great value The four seasons in Shanghai may not live up to the standart of its bigger sister in New York, however she is great value. The price Vs. performance, is far better than in NY. It may not be as stylish and more of a &quot;buissiness interior&quot; But its clean, modern and very well run. If you are picky when arriving and inspecting your room, the friendly staff does anything to help you to be satisfied.We had a room at the top floor witha fantastic view overlooking the superelevetad highways, scyscrapers, superconstructions and the buzz of this supermetropolis. For us the locations was just great. 5 minutes to all major attractions by taxi. Not like the &quot;Regent&quot; where we stayed for the first night. That was far out of town, and thats why we changed to the Four Seasons.The spa area is superb, with a superb pool and superb service.Breakfast rich, however a bit factory like. But hey! its a BIG hotel and the food served for breakfast was great.I would book it any day again if i get a good rate. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Horrible Experience - Stay at another Hotel This hotel was terrible and the service was bad at best. The location is in the middle of nowhere, although taxis are cheap to get around in. Also, they served me raw chicken in CHINA!!! We were sick for days. They did apoligize, but the apologies certainly seemed empty.Also, we did a wine and cheese night and the staff had no idea what the wines and cheese were. The night was a debacle and again, we got apologies. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The management did not go out of thier way to help our situation either, even the upper management of Four Seasons. Trust me, you don't want to get sick from raw chicken in China. If this was a 3 star hotel, maybe this would be okay, but when you pay for the best you expect the best! Don't stay here! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Clean lovely pleasant hotel I have nothing bad to say about the Four Seasons Shanghai. I wouldn't say it was utterly spectacular, but it was a VERY pleasant stay in a lovely hotel; very nice, attentive staff, incredibly clean, cozy, modern rooms, and a wonderful breakfast buffet. But it's very obvious once you step inside the hotel that they are mainly catering to a certain clientele - business men! They're everywhere. Like a freaky Magritte painting, men in business suits are all over the place. The lobby is small and sparse. I do however, have to compliment the incredibly kind front desk staff. Not one hitch during check-in; in fact I informed them that my husband would be arriving before me, and he had no problems obtaining a key even though the reservation was under my name. A bit on the pricey side, so we only stayed one night - but a very memorable stay over all. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Our Favorite In Shangha This is our favorite hotel in Mainland China. We have stayed here five times and each time we enjoyed our visit. There is an attention to detail we do not find at other hotels in this country. The warm service, the perfectly maintained and clean surroundings, the lovely rooms and the outstanding food. This is not to say this is a perfect Four Seasons, but compared to other Chinese Hotels, we find this property in a league of it's own.Rooms. We have tried the cheapest to the suite and prefer the Premier Room. It is very spacious and luxurious. There is a nice dressing area plus a good sized bathroom and a seating area. Some have fabuluous views. Service. Our first visit, three years ago was a bit rougher than our last visit this spring. They have really put together a great staff. They have a warmth you often don't find on hotel staff in China. Last visit they did the check in, not at the front desk but in our room, plus they usually send up a basket of goodies for my son.Upkeep. So many Chinese properties start to look run down quite quickly with chipped paint and stains, etc. Not here. It is all just like new.Food. Lovely breakfast with terrific service which has improved. Dinner service at the restaurants this last trip was not up to the standard we experienced previously.Location. Not as good as the J.W. Marriott, but worth the walk. Much better than anything in the Bund. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Should not be a Four Seasons This Four Seasons hotel did not live up to the Four Seasons standard which is usually great, so it was not good value for the money paid. FIrst of all its location is poor, not near Bund nor Old City, or shopping (to get there it's a 15 minute walk through a poor area). It's a 20-minute walk to the Shanghai Museum, but the hotel itself borders a traffic area with crossroads and overhangs. It is not near the Bund nor Pudong.The room was clean but small for Four Seasons standards, the lobby was loud and even the fountain was not a soothing presence but more of a rushing river that only added to the comomotion. Not a good value for the money spent, unlike other absolutely wonderful Four Seasons in Hong Kong for example. But in Shanghai, opt for the Hyatt in Pudong for view, location, ambiance and luxury. The Hyatt bars and restaurants which we visited were excellent and there were plenty of choices of restaurants there. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,first class I am setting in the lobby bar having my morning coffee. This place is spectacular. First class accomodations and first class service 
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Beautiful Property Quite Central This is a beautiful Five Star property in the center of Pu Xi, the Western (and livelier) part of Shanghai. In case you need to say the name of the hotel in Chinese it is Si Ji Jiu Dian. Although there are no malls or lively street life nearby, it is only really a 5 minute cab ride away from a lot of diifferent attractions. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and don't have that look of wear and tear so often present in Shanghai hotels. I stayed only one night, I wish I could have stayed longer! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"I Lived Like a King at the Four Seaons When we were in Shanghai, we stayed at the Four Seasons for a little over a week and spent another 3 nights at the Intercontinental. Both were rated as 5 star hotels but the reality was, the Four Seasons just wiped the floor with the Intercontinental in so many ways. It was no contest.First things first, the location of the Four Seasons in Puxi was perfect. Situated far away from the crowds of Nanjing Rd but within a comfortable walking distance to Huai Hai Rd (and Xin Tian Di), I could not think of a better location in Shanghai that offered a better insight into the city. This area had character. It was more than just the glass and concrete high-rises, the chaotic crowds, the insane traffic and the general hustle and bustle that is Shanghai. You had the restaurants and night markets along Wu Jiang Rd, the high-street fashion of Nanjing Rd West, the modern but pleasant shopping strip around Huai Hai Rd (unlike Nanjing Rd East) and the more eclectic nature of Puxi rather than the staid and clinical air of Pudong.If you enjoy exploring a city on foot then this is the place to be. The nearest subway station is also a stone’s throw from the hotel if you get sick of walking everywhere and taxis are dirt cheap if public transport is not your taste. Pudong is nice but I felt more at home and welcoming in Puxi.We stayed in a regular Superior Room and didn’t have the luxury of being upgraded to a deluxe or premier room but it didn’t matter – it still felt like heaven. The rooms were ultra clean, the service was impeccable, the staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities were top notch. My missus works in the hotel industry and she is uber-critical when it comes to accommodation. Even she had a hard time faulting the Four Seasons Shanghai. I made use of the business centre and was highly impressed with how everything was setup (except for the slower than usual broadband internet connection) and the gym and pool would be the envy of any paradise tropical resort. It honestly felt like we were on a second honeymoon if it weren’t for the fact that I was actually in Shanghai for work.I highly recommend the Four Seasons if you can manage to get a better deal than the burn-a-hole-in-the-wallet rack rate of 3,300 RMB. Otherwise, you would expect nothing less than being treated like royalty if you had to fork out that sort of dosh. This hotel was the highlight of my stay in Shanghai. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Spacious excellent service and one of the best hotels in china This is one of the best Four Seasons I have ever stayed. The service is amazing, the rooms and bathrooms space are amazing. The space compared to the other 5 star hotels in China is incredible. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great gym For the wonderful name that the Four Seasons has, I thought the rooms and hotel were just adequate to nice. It's a nice hotel, but not fantastic or exciting. I will give it the highest rating as having one of the best gyms of any hotel I've been to. Also, the bar was pretty lively with a really cute singer! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Should be called the Two Seasons? A major disappointment after our stay in Hong Kong at the Ritz Carlton! Although we had arranged a Club Room, at check in, which should have taken place in the club lounge, we had a somewhat cold reception from an incompetent employee. Having been told our room would not be ready for some time despite it being about 1345, half way through the process we were abruptly ordered to the club lounge where everything we had been told to that time was reversed and we were then taken to our room. Disappointment would have to be an understatement! I thought we were at the wrong hotel- was this the 1 1/2 Seasons? Very small rooms, spartan by comparison with other sister properties, and the basic &quot;lemon&quot; decor, of a very low quality did little to make up for the view of the cooling towers of the adjacent shabby high rise we were staring into some 15 metres away out the window! Have you experienced that sinking feeling when you have payed top dollar for what should be a great room only to be greeted with a property that is more in keeping with a basic business hotel in Wuhan? Further, having highly recommended the Four Seasons chain to my &quot;well to do &quot;,but frugal friend, I was acutely embarassed! The &quot;limp&quot; fruit bowl thrust abruptly through the door a few moments later did not improve my feelings about the place. The staff had little English, seemed poorly trained and almost unfriendly. Such a contrast to the excellent Four Seasons Singapore which I love. The lounge was ok; again better English is needed and the Stalinist attitudes need to be reviewed. I could not help but feel there needs to be more &quot;hands on&quot; by the manager and better training all around. This is not the Four Seasons as most of us know it. The surrounding area is uninteresting and seemed miles from anywhere. The concierge was helpful with print outs of areas of interest.I could not help but think that a number of &quot;generic&quot; hotels looking all much the same had been put up in this area of Shangahi, and the Four Seasons had picked one up to get a foot hold in Shanghai. Whatever, the brand is not represented well by this property, and the hotel to us was a big disappointment, particularly aftger staying at their properties in Singapore and Hong Kong. I gather they are building a property in Pudong- let's hope it is better than this place!For the money, there must be much better in Shanghai, but would someone please let me know where it is! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"One of Best Hotels I have stayed at The best way to sum up my experience at the Four Seasons in Shanghai is to say this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I have stayed at many Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons, etc., but this hotel exceeds all others. The facility is new, so the rooms, etc. are all in excellent shape. The food is excellent, but what truly distinguishes this hotel is the service. The staff at the hotel cannot do enough for you, and truly treat you like royalty. After making the long trip to China, there is no better place to get over the jet lag than at the Four Seasons.The location of this hotel is great as well. You are walking distance to museums, shopping and restaurants and just a short cab ride to the bund. No negatives, if you are going to Shanghai, can't go bad staying here... "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Lovely Lobby This hotel is lovely from the moment you walk in. My room was elegant with a beautiful bath. Very clean room, excellent laundry service and lavish buffet breakfast. Very nice little hotel shop too. The business center is small but nice and I never had to wait for a computer. I felt very comfortable here. It has a relaxing atmosphere which is welcome in such a large city. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Excellent! Everything about this hotel is true 5 star quality. We stayed for 3 nights in a Premier room (60 sq. m.) with a king and a cot for our teenager. Requested and received a high floor view. Room, bathroom and all fittings and fixtures were immaculate. Airport pick up service was great as was check in. Food is spectacular in the main cafe restaurant. Had the evening buffet one night and thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Location is close to Nanking Road with interesting side streets and local restaurants. The Four Seasons will not disappoint and in my opinion is even better than Four Seaons Singapore, which is also a great hotel. Don't hesitate to stay if you can afford the slightly high rates. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Fabulous Hotel! Our stay at the Four Seasons in Shanghai was fabulous, we traveled with our family including 2 children ages 10 &amp; 11 yrs. The kids loved the pool and swam everyday! The staff is very friendly and concierge spoke exellent English. Be sure to have the concierge write on a card where you would like to go in Mandarin then you can show it to a taxi driver, they have these nifty cards with a map on the back that made traveling around the city very easy by taxi. The buffet breakfast was great, as well as the other restuarants in the hotel. Be sure to check our #580 Nanjing Lu Road for ALL of the shopping knock offs, if you don't see what you want just ask, much is in secret rooms in the back (hidden from officials). Be sure to visit &quot;Cloud 9&quot; top of the Grand Hyatt 87th floor for good views! We will definitely come here again, and you can not go wrong staying at the Four Seasons! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great Asian hotel This hotel is the best in China that I have encountered. Very nice and large rooms with good spa facilities. Chinese restaurant is excellent and breakfasts are wonderful with a great selection. Food is varied enough that I did not become bored with selection even over a multi-day stay. Best of all is the service level. I became ill and the concierge found me an excellent English-language health clinic. Other aspects of service are also excellent. I find the neaby neighborhood interesting (in contrast to some other reviews) since a little bit of &quot;old Shanghai&quot; remains, with a few block walk, which is fast disappearing throughout the city. Overall, the 4S in Shanghai rates with the best hotels found in Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. I have been there twice and look forward to returning. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Nice but rough around the edges I stayed at the Four Seasons Shanghai for a week in late June while my husband attended a conference. I think his company booked almost the entire hotel, as our group of over 400 had the run of the place for the week we were there. We might have overwhelmed the staff, since the service was a bit inconsistent, and the food was only so-so at the (admittedly huge) breakfasts, lunches, and dinner buffets. I ordered room service once, and it was a lot tastier than what they served during our meals!I also had several spa treatments, which were pretty inconsistent. The pool was amazing though--I quickly established a daily ritual of swimming right before breakfast every day. The hotel is nicely decorated, and the staff is eager to help if a bit rough around the edges. All in all, doesn't live up to some other Four Seasons, but its off to a good start. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Wonderful Service but so-so location Fabulous service especially if you include Club Floor privileges. They greet you at curbside ( I had ordered a car from the hotel) wisk you to your room and check you in there. Rooms are great..bed was very comfortable..bathroom very luxurious. Club Floor was terrific..you can have them make dinner and other reservations. You can even checkout there. Great wine, 2 computers for your use and good breakfast and cocktail hour. A great place to start out your visit to Shanghai. While centrally located there is nothing interesting to directly walk to within a block or two from the hotel. Surroundings are a little dumpy. And everything that looks like 2 blocks on the map ends up being much farther. But definitely a good choice for the first couple nights. Much better than the Ritz which has a location too far away from anything but designer stores...why go there..we have those in the US. Also the Ritz has a very bad, huge covered entrance..with many tour buses etc. J. W. Marriot has a better location than either of these.Right acoss form People's Park and the Shanghai Art Museum and Katheen's 5 restaurant...all great. I did not go inside the JW but it looked good from the exterior. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Fantastic Hotel I just returned from a three night stay in this fantastic hotel (May 27-30, 2006). Service was superb, rooms were spacious and very comfortable (Premier Club room), Club Lounge was very comfortable &amp; efficient with excellent choices for breakfast and great selection of drinks in evening (as well as appetizers). Location was good (closer to Bund than Ritz Carlton), with a nice (long) walk to the Bund. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Shanghai. The hotel went beyond my expectations and I've stayed in many fine hotels around the world. After departing the hotel and arriving in Beijing, I realized I'd left music CD's in the room. I emailed the hotel to see if they could ship them to me in Atlanta...they offered to overnight them to my hotel in Beijing, free of charge. Excellent choice in Shanghai. Also highly recommend Jean Georges for a splurge dinner in Shanghai. The view of the bund and across to Pudong with the light show at night is spectacular. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel An oasis of calm, luxury and comfort in the heart of Shanghai. Everyone from bellman to the spa staff are polite and helpful. The rooms offer all of the comforts of home - bright open spaces with a great view of the Shanghai skyline - wonderful as the sun goes down and the lights come on.Want to arrange something extra special? Call on assistant concierge Tristan Huang for all of your needs - a delightful person and true professional - to make it happen. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"fantastic four seasons Just back from a business trip to Shanghai and loved the Four Seasons Hotel. Room:I was in one of the Superior rooms which was very large by European standards. There was a king size bed, widescreen TV &amp; DVD player, an armchair, internet connection, excellent clothes storage &amp; still plenty of free floor space to move around in. The bathroom was also very big, immaculately clean with a brilliant shower. Other nice touches included the complimentary L'Occitane toiletries (refreshed as quickly as you used them), the bathrobes and the slippers. Breakfast:It was buffet style &amp; had pretty much every conceivable style of breakfast food you could think of ordering. Everything I tried was good. We had 1 meal in the restaurant (the Chinese one - there are other styles available), and though not the best meal we had, was pretty good for a hotel.Location:Regrettably, I didn't have time to do as much exploring as I would have liked, so didn't get a great impression of the lie of the land &amp; where the hotel was in relation to other sites. It seemed central enough though - you could walk to the Bund in 30 mins &amp; there were interesting markets and stalls in the near vicinity.Service:I'm usually a little scepical about service, and would be of the attitude that the most important thing about a hotel is the room. It has to be said though, that the staff at the Four Seasons really do go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. All staff, without exception, were very polite, any requests I made were dealt with immediately &amp; there were some other nice touches such as complimentary water and fruit in the rooms.Gym:I didn't use it, but one of my colleagues said it was the best he'd ever seen in a hotel.Price:I paid around EUR 100 a night (excluding breakfast) - amazing value for the quality of the hotel for anyone with a European perspective.Overall, I whole-heartedly recommend the Four Seasons. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"A haven of calm My wife and I spent three nights here in May 2006. We ended up getting upgraded to an executive suite, which is always a nice way to start a stay. The executive level on the 37th floor provides a lounge with free breakfast, nibbles in the early afternoon and cocktails in the early evening, as well as two PCs for internet access. Rooms. The room we had (admittedly a suite) was spacious, and had two important features: a really excellent shower (with good water pressure) and a very comfortable bed. The Chinese seem to go in for very hard beds in even their luxury hotels, and so this was a relief in that it was an excellent matress - extremely relaxing to sleep in. The TV was OK rather than gigantic, and the level of furnishing was of a good standard. The room was maintained very well. Also, bedside lighs were of good quality and so allowed reading in bed - frequently a problem even in expensive places.Laundry - though I ticked the &quot;ordinary&quot; box (next day service) this came back within four hours!Si Ji Xuan restaurant (one of six in the hotel). This did good quality dim sum at a very fair price (around GBP 10 for plenty of food and tea). You can find better in Hong Kong or London is you search it out, but this was nonetheless very good. We also tried it for dinner and had a pleasant meal: good Sichuan prawns though a rather ordinary Beijing duck (go to the Grand Hyatt in Beijing for this) but certainly a very pleasant meal. Service: Excellent at all stages in our experience: friendly, competent. Pool and spa. There is a very pleasant indoor pool (though no view as such) on the fourth floor. The gym is of a very good standard, with plenty of cardio machines and a reasonable range of weights, including free weights. There is just one rowing machine which I never could figure out the settings of. Machines mostly have little TVs which you cna plug headphones into and wathc while you exercise. Decor: there are some nice art deco style touches e.g. the 37th floor lift area, though overall this is an America busness hotel, so the style is tasteful rather than very stylish.Location: conveniently near the French quarter, which has a delighful pedestrainised area with bars and restaurants (e.g. the excellent T8 restaurant) popular with expats. It is a few minutes taxi ride away from the Bund, and doesn't have a particularly spectacular view (go to the Grand Hyatt in Pudong for 87th floor views). Perhaps a setting on the Bund would be better for tourists, but this is certainly not inconvenient. Overall, a very good stay, and I would be very happy to return. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Four Seasons saved our trip tp Shanghai! We moved to the Four Seasons having checked out after one day from the Grand Hyatt (see my review to know why!). The FS is everything the GH is not. Discrete. Calm. Welcoming. Well-located. First the location. An earlier reviewer commented negatively on the neighbourhood but I couldn't disagree more. The neighbouring streets offer a very interesting insight onto Shanghai life away from the high-rise and always felt safe to us. Plus it is a five minute walk to the main metro line (which runs to the Maglev terminal, if you're travelling that way). The hotel is also on the edge of the French Concession which we found to be the main area to go at night for restaurants and during the day for shopping. We had booked a Premier Room but, after a bad experience at the Hyatt, asked to see the room before we checked in. They were very patient and showed us two rooms before me made the choice. The room was a very good size with an interesting view back towards the downtown area - beware, however, as I heard someone in the lift complaining that their room overlooked a building site on the other side of the hotel. I can understand those reviewers who complain that the standard of fittings in the room just isn't up to the luxurious standard expected from a FS. The cupboard doors and drawers were very thin and poor; the tv was small; and the room generally just didn't seem to have enough furniture in it. But it had everything we needed, there was plenty of space and the bed was wonderful.Service levels in the hotel, while not quite up there with the FS Hong Kong, were a welcome relief from the standard Shanghai brusqueness. Do go to the Chinese restaurant for a dim sum lunch - the lady who served us was delightful, talked us through the different choices and their sauces and kept our tea cups constantly filled! As we had just decamped from the Hyatt this lunch - a mere 15 pounds a head - calmed us down and assured us we had made the right decision. Special mention also to Helen the concierge who arranged everything from restaurants to train tickets efficiently and helpfully.This may not be the best FS in the world but it must surely be one of the best hotels in Shanghai. This is not really a city for tourists and even the FS was mainly filled with business people. Yet the atmosphere was so much more congenial and relaxed than the Hyatt and the location for sightseeing is unbeatable. Stay here and you won't regret it. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Loved It Stayed here for 5 nights in March and I loved it. Excellent service all around and with great L'Occitane products for use. Concierge was very helpful when needed and hotel is pretty close to Xiang Yang Market, Xian Tian Di, Yu Yuan Gardens, Nanjing Road, etc. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,An oasis in Shanghai We stayed 4 nights at the Four Seasons on the 30th floor in a Center Suite. We were upgraded from our reserved Executive Suite. The room was wonderful with every amenity that you would expect from a luxury hotel. The service is incredible and we looked forward to the welcome back greeting every time we returned to the hotel. The concierge staff handled all our plans without a hitch. It could not have been better. Breakfast at the Studio Cafe was elaborate and delicious. The Four Seasons is an elegant retreat in hectic Shanghai. We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. 
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"A very nice business hotel in Shanghai True to the Four Seasons brand, this is an excellent hotel to stay at on the Puxi side, very centrally located and not too far from anything. The rooms are very nice, the bathrooms have L'Occitane products. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel with excellent rooms Stayed two times in March'06. Excellent rooms with great views. Great breakfast buffet with fresh orange juice (a rarity in China). Great facilities, including spa. Very convenient location close to People's Square and the French Consession. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"The best hotel I have every stayed in I work in corporate travel and have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels throughout the world. The FS Shanghai is probably the best hotel I have yet stayed in. From the moment you arrive, you are treated with the most wonderful, courteous care and attention and made to feel very special. The room I stayed in was a junior suite and was very generously sized with separate seating area. The bed was enormous and extrememly comfortable with very soft sheets and a quilt. I especially loved the bathroom which had a very deep decadent bathtub and separate walk-in shower cubicle. The complimentary toiletries are by French Provence company L'Occitane and smell delightful. Running a bath takes around a minute thanks to some very powerful plumbing! At the time of my visit I had been feeling unwell and the hotel were very attentive, sending their own in-house Doctor and translater to my room who gave me exceptionally good care. I ate in the hotel on three occasions- room service Chinese breakfast which arrived promptly and was delicious and also a buffet breakfast and brunch in the ground floor restaurant. The choice of food at the buffets was staggering and lovely touches like ice-sculpted swans made it feel very special. If you are going to Shanghai then the Four Seasons is the ultimate in comfort and combined with the wonderful staff and great accommodations I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Absolutely fantastic. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,Great Hotel - Don't stay anywhere else Stayed at the Four Seasons 28 Dec 05 for 6 nights. What a lovely hotel. The staff were fantastic. Each time we returned to the hotel we were greeted with &quot;Hello and welcome back&quot; We had a centre suite which was extremely comfortable and spacious. Very large bathroom. Nice little touches such as fresh flowers around the suite. We got a great deal with their &quot;third night free promotion&quot;. The gym was well equipped. The change rooms/spa area was the best I have seen in a hotel. There was EVERYTHING one would need. It is a little further away from things than the Marriott (which did not seem as personal as the FS) but taxis are so cheap it didn't matter. If going to Shanghai stay at the FS. I have stayed at many excellent hotels around the world and the FS rates up there with any of them. Also visit Jean Georges Restaurant at Three on the Bund. - Fantastic!! 
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Very Nice Hotel Would Stay at Grand Hyatt Next Time Stayed at the Four Seasons for 2 nights in June 2005. Beautiful hotel, as you would expect from the Four Seasons. The room was huge, had a separate dressing room, and a large gorgeous bedroom. Service was excellent. The spa was wonderful and very reasonably priced. Loved the Western-style buffet breakfast. The only drawback was that the hotel was a bit out of the way. The Grand Hyatt in the Jin Mao Tower with all its great restaurants is obviously &quot;the place to stay.&quot; It's younger and more touristy. The Four Seasons is more mature and private. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel Great hotel. Excellent service, well located to the main attractions. Maybe I expected a little more from the breakfast, but a plus is that it can be served in your room at no extra cost (at least I wasn't charged anything).Hotel is new, rooms are good size, nice bathtubs. I'd stay there again for sure. A downside is that restaurants close at 10pm, but it's like this in all of Shanghai (don't ask me why, I simply can't understand...). Make sure you eat before that!!!Tip - do use the taxis, they're convenient and incredibly cheap. "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Sooo Bad! Usual 3 star experience from Four Seasons! My wife and I went on a Spa package that they offered. We had to carry our own bags as we entered the hotel. Front desk courtesy was poor. The Spa was a awful. The massage was terrible, quality of a 5 year old giving it to you. We contacted the General manager Peter Weber. He never stepped out of his office to talk to us. He gave us a 30 US dollar credit for the bad massage, but he just gave us our money back. At the Breakfast Buffet they had you set up amoung the uncleaned bar from the night before. Also witnessed very unhealthy practices at the breakfast buffet by the employees.1. Waiter digging his hand in the cold dry cereal containers to grab a hand full to put into his mouth. Several times.2. Chef sneezing without covering his mouth in the middle of the breakfast buffet, then touching all hot food chaffing dishes as he visual inspected. Several sneezes/touched every dish.Peter Weber the General Manager never came to visit us face to face as we requested. The hotel is flawed in many ways! Recommend staying at the JW Marriott, better local and great service!!! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"Getting better as it goes.... The FSS has improved since my last stay there in June. Its service standard has gone up and I am impressed that they treat their return guests very well. The nice touches of remembering my preferrence for Chinese snacks (and not milk chocs), my love for dark chocolates and my need for extra mineral water, etc all these tell me that I should return to FSS again... which I will do so in Fenruary next year! "
four seasons hotel shanghai ,"beyond my expetation Four Seasons in Shanghai is a low-profile luxury kind of hotel. It's a hidden gem. I fell in love with it the moment I stepped in the lobby.It's spotless clean, the flower arrangements are breath taking and the staffs are friendly. I tried 2 of their restaurants, both are good.I really enjoy my stay. Highly recommand. "

fraser residence shanghai ,"Great location and helpful staff We had one night at the New Harbour Hotel and the next day switched here. Fraser was perfect for us. The rooms were a bit small, but new and clean. We had a 2 bedroom with washer/dryer and full kitchen. Only negative was one bath for a family of 5, but we managed. They could do a bit better with the daily housekeeping (the trash cans are small and they did not empty them), but otherwise great place. The staff was so helpful and very patient with my 3 young boys. Breakfast for 2 was included at Element Fresh and we just bought extra. The location was great-we could walk everywhere! I highly recommend this place. Good business center and small gym, but had treadmills, weights, etc. Pool was a short walk located at the spa across the yard. Nice pool, but not great for kids since it was in the spa; will say the spa staff was patient with us. "
fraser residence shanghai ,"Good Choice for Serviced Apartment near XinTianDi I stayed here for a month during the summer, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable service apartment near the XinTianDi area. The service apartment is well located - about a 10mins walk to XinTianDi, 2 mins to HuaiHai Road, and the Times Square shopping mall where there is a good supermarket. Fraser Residence also is home to a trendy restaurant, Fat Olive, managed by local celebrity chef David Laris, and Element Fresh, a reliable salad/ sandwich chain popular with Shanghai expats. I had some problems with housekeeping but after a few calls to the front desk, those issues were resolved. Front desk is very helpful in general. Pool is dismal. I paid about RMB 600/ night for a one-bedroom for the duration of my stay. "
fraser residence shanghai ,"Much better than the earlier reviews indicate Despite prior Tripadvisor reviews, we stayed at the Fraser because it is close to where our daughter has a summer internship, we needed a 2BR apartment, and our travel agent negotiated a very good rate for an 11-day stay. We were wonderfully surprised at the quality of the room and the services of the staff. There are two excellent American-style restaurants on the sixth floor that are very popular with the local expat community (The Fat Olive and Fresh Essential). The food was good and reasonably priced, and friendly waitresses taught us some Mandarin.The location is within walking distance of Huai Hai Lu shopping area (2 blocks north), a grocery and ATM machines in the basement level of Times Square shopping mall, People's Square, Xintiandi, and Old Town. Taxis are so cheap that you probably won't walk, though, except for the exercise. The staff was helpful in writing our destinations in Chinese characters for the cab drivers. Ask the hotel to get its driver to pick you up from Pudong Airport rather than rattle around in a cramped cab. Be sure to carry the hotel's cab card to get back to the htoel because many of the cabbies found it tough to find the place.We like the Fraser so much that we negotiated a monthly rate for our daughter, who is staying for another 10 weeks in a 1BR apartment at the Frayser during her summer job.There will be construction throughout Shanghai until Expo 2010, including putting a subway under Xi Zhang South Road next to the Frayser. The noise was not too bad, though, on the 17th floor. "
fraser residence shanghai ,"great location to experience local living Booked a 2 bedroom penthouse. Living room is newly renovated &amp; very nice. But bedrooms are very small. with a baby cot, there's hardly space to walk. Toilets looked barely renovated, as the style &amp; design are very different from the living rooms. Washing machine was not working well - dryer timer was spoilt &amp; 6 hours later, my clothes were still drying! Luckily they fixed the problem after I notified them. Broadband internet also took some time to fix before I could use them. Kitchen utensils are quite complete. With young kids I usually buy food back &amp; dine in, so the bowls &amp; plates come in handy.Food - not impressed with Element Fresh. Bought my breakfast at the streets nearby. Freshly baked cakes going at 8 rmb for 10. Deep fried dough (you tiao) at 1 rmb each. Yummy. For dinner, the restaurants in the streets nearby sell fried rice at 5 rmb a plate, duck noodle soup at 8 rmb, fresh big oysters at 1 rmb per piece, prawns, crabs etc etc....Initially I thought the location was a little far - took me a good 10 min to walk to Huangpi nan rd. But soon I found a gem. The next section of Shou Ning Rd comes alive after 9pm. Road stalls lined the road, selling clothes, DVDs, &amp; food (fried noodles). Really got a feel of how the locals live. "
fraser residence shanghai ,"Good choice Nice, clean apartment style facility.Free internet. Courteous staff all around. Element Fresh Restaurant provided decent breakfast; great juice bar.Location also good for walking, subway.Would recommend. "
fraser residence shanghai ,"Very LOUD! - under construction ok, well here are some things that every person needs to know. I have stayed in this hotel off and on since March 2008. The Hotel is undergoing a phased renovation. As a result, there is constrant noise ocurring very early in the morning. They tell you that the construction only starts at 9:00PM, but in fact the banging has started at 7:00AM. It is now Sunday morning that I am writing this review, and I can assure you that there is allot of noise going on right now which woke me up at 7:00AM. I've complained for months, but the truth is, construction workers are very hard to control here in China. I highly recommend staying awya from this hotel for at least 6 months while they finish their work. "
fraser residence shanghai ,??????????? 
galaxy hotel ,"Nice Hotel; Very Modern We spent a night at this hotel during our China tour. I didn't notice the dirty carpets that others have complained about in their reviews. The breakfast was excellent and is served in the atrium that offers a gorgeous view straight up the inside of the towering building, with giant scrolls running down the walls. Our room (not sure if it was a standard or not, since our tour group booked it for us) was very nice and came with some additional features like a washer/dryer, which is handy if you've been traveling around and have accumulated a pile of dirty clothes (and laundry service is EXPENSIVE). The inside of the hotel was very beautiful and modern. "
galaxy hotel ,keep your slippers handy just returned from the galaxy hotel...Checked in all looked fine. Got up to the room and all I can say is DIRTY. Carpets looked like a construction worker had tried to ground mud into the carpet. afraid to take off our shoes...found the slippers and put them on as a barrier to the carpet. Not sure all the towels had been replaced...so climate change be darned we put every single towel in the tub to be changed. not that close to the subway....but a 10 minute walk got you to a line that let you transfer to line 2 and all of the sights of shanghai. loved the city but not the hotel..... 
galaxy hotel ,"Mutton dressed as lamb I stayed at this hotel to attend an exhibition at the Exposition. Its certainly not as local is made out on the information I got, and its a good 20 minute walk (and you have to cross some major 10 lane roads) to get there! This hotel is ok - the second room I got was ok, having rejected the first on the basis that it was dirty (there were stains all over the bed covers...) Although my room had been prepaid (and guaranteed) by one of the worlds largest business travel agents, I still had to pay DOUBLE the room rate per night up front on either a credit card (not as a pre-authorisation, as an actual transation) or in cash. None of the staff speak more than a few words of English either - making it rather difficult.The major problem of this hotel is the dining - breakfast is expensive by western rates (15 Euros) for quite a limited buffet - and other meals are far more. I never had more than basic meals in the other restaurants as the quality was horrific, and the cost was very high... Beer at the bar/restaurant is horrifically expensive, at 4.50 Euro per bottle of cheap beer. There were a lot of things that really bugged me during this stay - like the chinese waitress who began to lay the table for the next customer literally seconds after I had finished my meal and was still drinking (!), to the terrible layout of reception and the other parts of the hotel and having to pay for everything upfront, twice over. (internet, mini-bar). Also, if you want to sit in the bar at night (which is terrible and 8 dollars a beer) you'll need to be able to tolerate the horrific chinese renditions of western love songs, sung daily by a cheap, tired group from 7-11pm. I ended up drinking beer with my iPod on just to drown it out.I got room service on one night, and after eating something and thinking &quot;this is a bit cold&quot; I got violent food poisoning for the next 12 hours. This hotel is not near the center of anything - its a 30 RMB taxi to downtown, and more to other tourist spots. The hotel appeared nice when I first arrived, but during my 5 night stay I learned to really despise it. This was made even worse when I when for dinner at the Rennaisance just 400 yards away (which was 30% more for a room) and it was in a different league. It was like taking a cheap, tacky Chinese hotel (which the galaxy is) where hookers hang out every night, and comparing it to a beautiful western hotel with chinese influence and amazing bars and evening entertainment. I was gutted. this was a really bad choice for me - next time its anything but the Galaxy. "
galaxy hotel ,With Good view of Shanghai Nice Hotel with good amenities and ample room space. Covers good view of Shanghai from hotel room and lobby.Thanks to the room and interior heating system which makes us to forget that we are in a city where outside temperature is sub zero. Located in the heart of city and having good connectivity with main attractions of city. Nice Cuisine with Shanghai's Famous Crab 
galaxy hotel ,"Good Hotel if English is not needed Stayed here for one night as we could not get accommodation in Renaissance for our full stay in Shanghai.It is located in the same business district as Renaissance and costs something like 70% of what Renaissance charges.A good value for money at the price you pay with all standard business facilities as well as a pool and gym.The downside is the fact that not many of the staff members speak English or can help you if you ask a question in English.As it was my first trip to Shanghai, it was difficult to make them understand what I want (unlike the Renaissance where you are at home).The rooms were good as was the bathroom and the linen. "
galaxy hotel ,"Cheaper than a Five Star I moved here from my return from Jinan as this Hotel was cheaper than the Renaissance Yangtze...and I wish I hadn't. This Hotel is huge! No personal touch at all and full of loads of tourists and tour Operations. The Housekeeping staff went to the extent of trying to charge me for water and sanitary napkins without a bill. There was no breakfast place and the measly sandwich I could pick up in the Lobby was overpriced. Definitely not my kind of place, but OK just to spend a night or so. "
galaxy hotel ,"Highs and Lows Its really quite hard where to start describing the Galaxy as it tries to be all things to all people. Its well located in Shanghai for most business areas and perhaps has a better western food selection than most other hotels I've stayed in in Shanghai. (The breakfast is great..) Also the view from the top floor (32nd floor) bar, on the odd clear night that you get is just fantastic, (well worth the extra you pay for the drinks..). The ammenities are great, shops, barbers, selection of restaurants, bar, even a Karaoke style and full nightclub are here, as well as the usual sports and gym activites. (so you will never be bored in the evenings..)I imagine when the hotel opened it was very grand, however it now looks very tired and in need of a good clean, also you are likely (western business men espicially), to get followed in by girls, off the street, and bothered by other locals, even as far as the girls will try and get in your room. The hotel staff seem to turn a blind eye to this, as do the local police.At night unless you are brave enough to try and take a taxi somewhere, there is very little to do or see around the hotel area, and again if you do venture out you will soon be approached by girls.Not a bad hotel for a short business stay, but not one for the family or longer vacation and please Galaxy.. Get the cleaners in.. "
galaxy hotel ,"Old and dirty Hotel do not book this hotel! The hotel was not remodeled for the last years, therefore you will find dirty carpets and bathrooms and beds. When you arrive at night a lot of chinese girls wait for you to come to your room...The breakfast was o.k. but very expensive (about 20 USD) Never again! "
galaxy hotel ,Very Nice but out of the way We just returned to Canada from staying at the Galaxy in Shanghai on our tour. The hotel lobby on the 1st and 2nd floors are very elegant. The hotel room was nice but nothing exceptional. The carpets were dirty as were the other two hotels we stayed. The breakfast was better than average and the service was great. The reception staff were not very interested or helpful when we asked about getting one bed instead of two.We went for a walk around the area and found it was not in the best location. However it was great for our bus tour as it was near all the tourist attractions we visited. 
galaxy hotel ,"FILTHY CARPETS I escorted a tour to China and our group stayed 2 nights at the Galaxy Shanghai. Although in the middle of nowhere, the first impression of this large convention hotel was excellent....beautiful huge lobby, bar with live entertainment, nice restaurants and friendly bell boys. When we got off the elevator on the 10th floor, I remarked that the rugs in the hallway definitely needed shampooing. They were filthy. At first glance the room looked ok, perhaps a bit &quot;tired&quot; for a 4 star hotel and in need of re-decorating...but then I noticed the carpet...every square inch of the carpet was filthy, filthy, filthy! I mean ground in &quot;mud&quot; ! I have been a travel agent for 30 years and have never seen anything like it. Our group had 7 rooms booked on the 10th &amp; 14th floors, and every room was the same. One room also had cups filled with tea from the previous guests still sitting on the dresser. Everyone in my group commented this hotel was absolutely disgusting and in a bad location. Better to stay in the area of Nanjing Road. "
galaxy hotel ,"Good location for the price This hotel was well located (if it's possible to be so in Shanghai) Best shopping was at the Pearl International Market which was a $2 cab ride away...slightly further, the &quot;Bazaar&quot; had all the 'local' goods and the sellers were wiling to bargain. I dont' recommend the hotel restaurant (except for the hot dogs which were awesome!) as they put whipping cream on the baked potato! Great for a laugh but not real tasty. The rooms were spacious and well appointed....and quiet. The staff was very helpful with everything including taxi drivers. I would definately recommend this hotel. "
galaxy hotel ,"Well run hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel in September 2007 for 4 nights as part of a group tour.We found the hotel to be more professional than the other hotels on our tour. The staff were friendly and helpful.Our room was decent and clean without being anything spectacular. The beds were hard as per everywhere else in China. Galaxy has a smallish gym with good equipment, but no pool. This hotel had the best buffet breakfast of our tour hotels - good quality and a wide variety of food. For snacks and groceries, we walked to the Parkson Grand, which has a supermarket downstairs. The Friendship store is closer but more expensive. We had an excellent foot massage just down the road from Parkson (there are big &quot;massage&quot; signs pointing down the street). There is probably not much in the way of tourist attractions near the hotel. It is about a 20 minute taxi-ride to the city. The park nearby was vibrant at night, with locals dancing and singing. Overall this is a nice hotel that offers good value and professional service. "
galaxy hotel ,"Great Place The Galaxy We were with a tour group and enjoyed our 4 night stay at this hotel. The atmosphere was good and the breakfast which was included had an excellent selection. We did have room service on one night when we arrived at the hotel late and it was rather slow coming but an enjoyable pasta meal all the same. One thing we found really strange that we were asked to pay cash when we were guests of the hotel. This was the 1st time that this had ever happened to us. We also had this same problem with our laundry so my husband went down stairs and paid directly at reception. We did find that some of the staff had very poor English.We had supper one night in a very nice bar area, the service was excellent and nothing was too much bother. There was nice piano music which created a nice ambience.Our room was large with two double size beds and nice clean bed linen with a good size bathroom. It was not a luxury type room but definitely adequate There were tea making facilites replenished each day and bottled drinking water supplied.One thing should be mentioned is the fact that this hotel may appear to be close to the airport but in fact it is at least an hour or more away &amp; longer in peak traffic from the Pudong International Airport. Many people have made this mistake and ended up at the other airport which is used more for Domestic flights . The very fast train is a good option to get to Pudong but the time table currently only starts just after 7.00am and if you have an early flight is perhaps not possible. Certainly something to be considered when booking flights. "
galaxy hotel ,"Good hotel not a great area for exploring While the convenience to Hongqiao airport (the domestic airport for China) is quite ideal, the ease of access via metro into Shanghai city proper isn't the best. You pretty much need to take a cab to the nearest metro stop. Cabs are very cheap so you might be better off just taking a taxi for your entire journey. Nothing is in walking distance and it is surrounded by other business type hotels. Lots of tour groups stay here which fills the property up. Clean, pleasant and decent breakfast buffet. "
galaxy hotel ,"Enjoyed the Galaxy! I stayed at this hotel for business meetings in Shanghai. The hotel is lovely, with a great breakfast buffet in the morning - western style food as well as local food. There are two restaurants in the hotel, one is local food -- very good selections and good service -- and a Korean BBQ -- also very good food and good service. I stayed in the business suites for my stay and found the accommodations very tasteful and elegant. It had a spa-like feel to the room, towels, etc.As for the location, yes it is a bit west of downtown Shanghai proper. However, I did go out walking several days to antique shops, memorial gardens, etc. I took a cab to other places I wanted to see (Yu Garden, Bund, temples, etc) and found the cab fare to be very reasonable -- only about 3-5 dollars per ride. The traffic is a bit cumbersome, so the cab rides sometimes were a bit lengthy.All in all, I found the stay at this hotel to be very nice. It served the business needs quite well. If I were in Shanghai only for vacation, it might be nice to be closer to downtown, but as I said, cab fare is reasonable and finding a cab is quite easy. "
galaxy hotel ,"Good clean accommodations Stayed at this hotel at the beginning of a 14-day tour of China; we spent three nights here. Location is not desirable as it is not central to all the attractions. But since we were in a group tour, we drove to all the sights and attractions from early morning to evening with no time to spare. Hotel is rated as a four-diamond by Chinese standards, but by American standards, I would only rate this as three-diamond. Saw lots of Americans/Europeans, but most of the staff spoke very little English. Breakfast was extremely good with Chinese and Western dishes. They even have a Korean and Japanese corner with sushi and miso soup. Quality of food is above average. Service is a little more to be desired. You have to wait for your coffee cup to be refilled. Rooms are extremely clean and well appointed. We had a in-room safe along with refrigerator in our room. The only thing that it lacked was an iron &amp; board which you have to call to bring up to your room.This is an excellent hotel for tour groups. For individual leisure travelers, the location is undesirable and you will have to find transportation to get everywhere. "
galaxy hotel ,"Nice Hotel Arrived for three days and two night. Great hotel, but it is not located near the main attractions. The hotel staff was wonderful and the breakfasts were great. The rooms were very large and clean. The hotel has a two stry lobby that was very interesting. The elevators were very fast and the staff met all of my needs. If you are going to Shanghai for business and do not need to see any of the sights, this is a wonderful place to do business. Several meeting were being conducted all over the hotel. However, if you want to get out and walk the streets at nigh and be near the sights this is not the place for you. "
galaxy hotel ,"Chinese hospitality Spent two nights at the Galaxy at the end of a three city trip.Glitzy high rise hotel catering to business and pleasure tourists from all over the world. Very nice room, very clean. Very close to Parkson department store and City Center Bldg (walkable). Lots of service help everywhere. Mostly very helpful but not always in the large breakfast area. Ample buffet style with lots of choices, more Western than I liked but there was something for everyone. A &quot;Korean Corner&quot;, baked beans and white sausage for the Brits, frosted flakes for the Americans. Service was lacking here, maybe because they were so busy. We were seated at the end of a table for 8 where there were 8 people. No offer to move us, they brought 2 more chairs and squeezed everyine in. Took 3 requests for a spoon before we went and found our own. Coffe was not self-erve and took a very long time to get a refill. Long wait for juice glasses and fruit bowls to be filled in at buffet. Scramble style area so lots of bumping and queueing repeatedly.Received an electic adapter less than 2 minutes after requesting.Two complimentary bottlesof drinking water each dayTakes a very long time to get hot water butwhen it comes, there is plenty and water pressure very good. "
galaxy hotel ,good way to end our tour The Galaxy hotel was our last hotel on our 15 day tour. There werea lot of North Americans at this hotel. The rooms were clean and modern. The buffet breakfast was delicious and was one the highlights for us in Shanghai. This hotel was not along the Bund but we were able to take a taxi there for under $10. There was also some stores and restaurants nearby (although we didn't eat there)

gallery suites ,"Disappointed cannot be called an art gallery hotel I read about this hotel from Business Traveler Magazine and had some expectations on the decor and design of this @Gallery Suites (Art Gallery Suites Hotel). However, when I entered into a tiny lobby with only one small piece of artwork, I began to doubt. Then, when I entered into my own suite (#301), I was very surprised as it is no where like what the BT Magazine described. My room has a plain green wall with no art work, no design and such. The room size is good but it was so noisy from car horns on the street from like six in the morning till mid-night. Service is okay but this new hotel definitely does not meet my expectation and I will not stay there again. "
gallery suites ,"Art Décor Style in Shanghai I was in Shanghai for business and stayed 6 nights at the Gallery Suites Hotel. I have heard of this hotel because it is owned by a Singapore tour company and also because the interior style of their rooms have been much talked about in the local press.Objectively speaking, the location of the hotel is rather ideal as it is located in the French Concession quarters. The surrounding environment has a somewhat European feel and there are many little eateries and restaurants nearby. The underground station is merely a few minutes’ walk away and the Huaihai Road shopping street is only 2 stations away. There is also a shopping district about 5mins’ walk, through a nice park, so you really won’t feel the distance.The hotel itself is a conservation building and has only 50+ rooms. Rooms are spacious and very well-appointed. One thing to note is that the rooms may be more suitable for couples or single travelers as the bathroom is separated from the bedroom with only a beaded curtain and nothing else (at least for the room I had). The room is equipped with LCD TV, DVD player, free internet access and iPod docking station (on request). The hotel will also provide you a mobile phone for local calls, which I think is a very useful service. Staff are generally attentive and obliging and most speak English. Breakfast, although it is included in the room rates, starts only 7.30am, so if you need to leave the hotel earlier for business or tour, you can request for them to pack some local breakfast for you.All in all, I cannot find anything negative about the hotel and would not hesitate to recommend anyone who is thinking of staying there. I would probably stay here again if I need to go to Shanghai in the future! "
gallery suites ,"The only boutique hotel in Shanghai! If you're looking for a unique experience then the gallery suites is an ideal boutique hotel option!We travelled as a group of over 20 ppl and the hotel managed to accommodate our needs sufficiently. An added bonus was the friendly staff who did their best to ensure each guest had a pleasant experience. Special thanks to Frankie , Ben, Angie and the rest of the team that assisted us.The hotel is newly opened and has a non smoking policy in place to everyone's delight. Rooms were spacious and were beautifully decorated in an art deco style of old Shanghai but with all the modern day conveniences we like. Recommend you take time to enjoy the tea room and art gallery they have!Hotel is located in the picturesque French Concession area and was also close to the main attractions of Shanghai. The only meal the hotel provides is breakfast which was simple but service was disappointing. Unfortunately there's no room service available either but given the experience with breakfast may be a good opportunity to try one of the many restaurants in the area.We all had a great experience and would recommend this hotel for both personal and small group tours. "
gallery suites ,"Very Nice Indeed This is how impressed I am with this beautifully restored boutique hotel in Shanghai - I can't wait to get home to give them the review :) therefore I am writing it here in the room now.Location-wise it's great as it's only a very short walk to the Heng Shan Lu/Road Station (Line 1) on the Metro (subway) line, it's not right at &quot;downtown&quot; which works out perfectly for us as I get to experience more of the local flavours of Shanghai. It's in a residential area next to a little park. We got a nice room that also has a &quot;sun-room&quot; which is great to relax on the chaise lounge after an action-packed day of walking and sight-seeing (or if you are here on business).Breakfast is included though the choices may be a little limited - (yet sufficient) - for us it's a not a problem as we prefer to go for the local options of soy milk and fried dough (You Tiao in Mandarin) for breakfast anyway - being Chinese it's a treat to relive those fond child memories.Everyone here has been extremely friendly and approachable, while at the same time very efficient. We arrived after a long flight from Chicago direct, and it was a little before their scheduled check-in time of 3 pm. The room wasn't ready then (which we didn't expect it to be since it's a relatively small operation of less than 40 rooms) so we were treated with tea/coffee at the lounge. The Guest Service Manager offered to give us a tour of the building and some of the rooms (so if we are happy with any of them instead of our designated room they would be happy to switch for us). They are all beautiful rooms indeed, the interior designers did a fantastic job restoring this heritage listed art deco building.In the end though, we still prefer the room we were assigned to (for the fact that it has a little triangular &quot;sun-room&quot;) - the wait wasn't too long really.I had chosen this hotel for the fact that they advertised it as an entirely non-smoking property (which of course is very important when one has issues with allergies). I had stayed in other properties in Asia before, at times even if you requested a non-smoking room (or non-smoking floor), the room would still stink like an ash-tray regardless of the hotel class. So this really was a big selling point for people like me.At check-in, we also discovered that they would provide you with a mobile phone to use (I even got my Skype-in number diverted to it) so you are still connected even when out and about, very handy! There is no charge for in-coming calls, think about all the roaming charges you save :)YES, I would love to stay here again if we visit Shanghai in the future. "
gallery suites ,"Step back in time at this fantastic boutique hotel Positioned near Hengshan Road station this is a great little hotel. Only 40 rooms decorated in Art Deco style, the staff couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly. I had problems with my TV which they immediately apologised for and upgraded me to a bigger Art Deco Suite.Great place to base yourself to explore the wonderful French Concession and it's a only 15 minutes on the subway to get to the Bund and Pudong.It has been recently opened and they have done a great job in keeping the character of the building. They are still waiting for the cable channels to be installed for overseas TV shows, but that's hardly a problem. There is a cafe downstairs where you can get a complimentary breakfast, but didn't see if they offered room service for meals and/or drinks.Overall, a thoroughly good, clean and spacious hotel, and if I go back to Shanghai then I will certainly stay there again.

golden jade sunshine hotel ,"Mixed feelings I stayed at this hotel last year in march. Actually, I was rather satisfied with my choice but there are a few issues which contribute to a lower rating. Advatages:- Beautiful rooms. In my opinion, one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever been to. They are big, very clean, equipped with everything one could need and have a special atmoshere.- Friendly and helpful staff.- Nice common areas with Chinese influence in furniture and architecture.Disadvatages:- Location. There is nothing of interest in that area, even no posibilities to have a drink. The only way (exept taxis) to get to the Bund is taking a bus (up to half an hour!!) and it is complicated to find the bus station, especially on the way back from the Bund to the hotel.- Breakfast is tasteless and served in ugly rooms, partly without windows. - No spa area in the hotel (at least I couldn't find any)- Appearance from outside is nothing special, just a simple block which cannot be compared to the stunning hotel architecture in Shanghai (but this is a minor issue)To sum it up, I do not regret having stayed in the Golden Jade Sunshine but there are surely better choices.Shanghai as a city is well worth a visit. It does not have the same historical and cultural feeling as Beijing but is a perfect example if you want to see how a nation's national economy can prosper. Quaters like Pudong, the Bund or Nanjing street as well as the French quater and also other places are just gorgeous, whereas the &quot;old city&quot; and everything else connected with Chinese traditions is disappointing. All in all, I loved Shanghai and hope to return one day but prefer Beijing. "
golden jade sunshine hotel ,"Adequate for our needs Hotel part of the Travelsphere Discover China Tour. Nothing much around the hotel and views from the hotel were of building sites. However planned activities on both nights meant that the location wasn't a problem. Supermarket across the road was brilliant for cheap beer and chocolate. Smoky in the bar area but we were on the non-smoking floor so that was OK.Rooms large and well appointed with all possible toiletries etc.Shower was good, had an enormous bath.I didn't like the hot/cold water dispenser in the room thought the water tasted strange. It seemed to take forever to boil and didn't seem that hot. I would buy alternative bottled water from the supermarket and drink that.Breakfast was adequate.A Satisfactory stay. "
golden jade sunshine hotel ,"Plenty of sunshine in Shanghai! If you're not after a hotel smack-bang in the middle of all the activity in Shanghai, then look no further!The Golden Jade Sunshine Hotel was great in terms of cleaniness, comfort and friendliness. Rooms were tastefully decorated &amp; large, and bathrooms had a generous shower and vanity area. If you are sensitive to smoke though, do yourself a favour and book yourself onto the non-smoking floor because people in Shanghai smoke (and spit...ugh) absolutely everywhere!It's about a 15minute taxi ride from Nanjing road and there's not really alot happening in the area around the hotel- although there's a great convinient store across the road where you can grab some 2 minute noodles for the midnight munchies.Hotel provided complimentary bottled water everyday and hotel slippers, and you can even rent a plug adaptor so you can charge your camera, phones, etc.Breakfast was a little ho-hum. Loved the variety, but everything tasted bland and oily. Typical of Shanghai food I guess, so can't complain...plus can't go out and get breakie anywhere else since there was no where else local to eat!I reccommend this hotel if you are after a quiet location to stay in, or if you're on tour or staying with young kids. Otherwise if you are after more things to do and more places to wonder in your free time, I highly reccommend staying somewhere else closer to Nanjing road. "
golden jade sunshine hotel ,"very nice hotel I've stayed at Golden Jade Sunshine Hotel in Shanghai in January and I've had a great time. Hotel is situated out of the city centre but I didn't mind that much because taxis are cheap and they can get you anywhere. The neighbourhood is nice and very convenient because there are several supermarkets, a pharmacy and other amenities one can find useful. The interior of the hotel is designed in oriental style and our room was in oriental style also. The room was very comfortable and nice. The only shortcoming was that our window was overlooking a construction site just a few meters away from our hotel which made a horrible view and noise from 7am untill 4 pm. The room is equipped with satellite TV so you can watch CNN, HBO and a number of Chinese TV stations and there is also a broadband connection which is not free. Since I didn't bring my laptop with me I wanted to use the internet at the business centre but I was told that all the non-Chinese websites were not available because of some mechanical problem (!?).The staff was really nice and helpful. They spoke both English and German very well.We had a buffet breakfast which was really nice. We could choose between Chinese breakfast and a Western one.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. "

grand hyatt shanghai ,Wow The most awesome hotel I've ever seen in the tallest building i've ever been in (99 floors!) 
grand hyatt shanghai ,Luxurious quiet and comfortable The hotels lobby is on the 54th floor which means that the hotel begins on the 55th floor and above. Every room has exceptionally beautiful views of downtown Shanghai. The outside of the hotel reminds me of the Chrystler building in New York. The service is fenomenal. They even have people standing at the elevators so that you do not even have to puch the elevator button. The bar on the roof is awesome 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Disappointing The best thing about this hotel was the view. The worst was the service.The pros were (apart from the view) the attractive well equipped rooms, Cloud 9 bar, the buffet breakfast and the pool and leisure facilities. The restaurants were also pretty good albeit the food in the grill arrived in Chinese style - the side dishes some time after the main course! The cons were the service and the cramped smokey public areas. The reception area was particularly cramped and the reception staff somewhat unfriendly and unhelpful. The bar at the bottom of the impressive internal atrium was also rather poor; it lacked any atmosphere and had a bad odour of stale smoke and old food. Unfortunately, this smell drifted up to the rooms on the lower floors. The constant noise from surrounding building works was also a detraction; whereas this was not the hotel's fault, given the prices charged for the rooms, I would have expected to have been advised about this when at the time of booking (during our stay the building works were 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and, whilst the noise did not keep us awake, it detracted from the overall experience.All in all, an attractive hotel in a reasonable location with decent rooms but service falling far short of what I would expect of a 5 star hotel and far short of the service in the much superior Grand Hyatt in Beijing. In a word, disappointing. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"What a great hotel one of the worst front desk I stayed at Grand Hyatt with my wife for 2 days.The location and the room was one of the greatest I have ever stayed.When I came to the front desk for check out,they told me that the hotel stay was not paid for the company and they had to draw the amount from mycredit card.Although I know it was paid but unfortunately forgot the voucher,I authorized them to do this action.When I was back to Turkey,I checked my documents and the action was made 2 times which was already paid by yhe company.It is really a shame for Grand Hyatt and I would like to warn the trip advisor's readers for this hotel.Please be very careful.Ali Ergen,M.D.Ankara,Turkey "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Grand hotel service not the best Great location and nice hotel, but unfortunately the reception staff are not very flexible. I had a small issue with my reservation and I ended up arguing with the front desk for over 10 mins. At no time did they offer me any alternative solutions or try to accommodate me. When I tried to escalate the issue to a more senior manager, it took more time. When travelling for business, time is of utmost importantance, so to have these types of issues is unhelpful. Stay at the Shangri-la - a much better and more welcoming hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"5 star all the way incredible food incredible view incredible room! This was the highest hotel in the world when we visited in May, standing where only 15-20 years ago, would had been rice paddies! The room was very large with beautiful wood and art thruout. The bathroom had a most interesting layout with glass wall on one side and sliding teak doors across from a WONDERFUL shower and jacuzzi tub.The bar in the room was inset across from a mirrored wall and looked and felt rich and well appointed. From the hallway/balcony you could look down to the lobby as if you were in an incredible whirlpool of art! The food was incredible- a bountiful buffet of gormet selections in a dining room offering an unsurpassed view of the city. This hotel comes highly recommended! The service was superior. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Staying in the clouds An amazing experience. The hotel lobby is on the 54th floor! Views to the city and river are great from all angles. They have a great lunch time business menu on the 54th floor. Have a drink o the 86th (or as it 88th?) floor after dark - great views.Rooms are very luxurious and the bathroom great. Try showering on the 75th floor next to window!Service was 100% 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Expensive luxury in one of the highest hotels in the world. We stayed for six nights during the Total Solar Eclipse on July 22, 2009. (Sadly, the eclipse was rained out. :()We upgraded to the club level, and got a room on the 83rd floor with _stunning_ views of the Pudong river and surrounding city. Club level was an extra $120/night, but the amenities almost made it worth the cost.I'd give it an Excellent rating, but the construction in the area really made it hard to get around.Club level also gets you access to an exclusive lounge that serves an upscale continental breakfast, afternoon tea and sandwiches, and an open bar during cocktail hour. The food was an assortment of small snacks, but they were of top quality. (My girlfriend still raves about the smoked salmon she had for breakfast every day. She said it was some of the best salmon she'd ever had.)The room was of a decent size. The bed was a little hard. The 42&quot; LCD TV was nice. The bathroom was quite opulent, with both a shower, and a large tub. Maid service was invisible and efficient. All of the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.The downside is that the entire area around the hotel is all torn up with construction, in preparation for a world's fair on 2010. The access tunnel to the metro has been closed during construction, and it's a long walk to the next entrance. The riverside opposite the hotel (the Bund) is also completely torn up, further reducing the quality of the view.I would definitely recommend this hotel - especially if you can get a package price on the rooms.I think the one downside of the hotel is that it's so high up that you feel kind of isolated from the city. (It would have been perfect for the eclipse - if it hadn't been overcast. :) I think the next time we visit Shanghai, we'll get one that's closer to the pulse of this vibrant city.Oh, and I picked up a computer virus on my USB memory stick from their PC in the business center. :) "
grand hyatt shanghai ,worth it just for the view and the bathrooms! was the tallest hotel in the world when we stayed there. rooms and floor to ceiling windows overlooking windows. restaurants and bars very chic. walking distance to pearl and aquarium.best bathroom EVER.. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,Has to be one of the nicest hotels on the planet This hotel exceeded my expectations eevery time. In all the years I have been staying here it has never been anything but amazing. I always am able to get the same suite and at almost $3000 a night it is a great value. The staff remember my name and are always very helpful. Can t go wrong with the Hyatt grand 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Beautiful hotel.. I was very impressed with the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai, the hotel itself is beautiful and the location is very good with breathtaking views. Drinks in the bar at the top were very enjoyable. Service, as at most of the Hyatt’s I have stayed at, was of a very high standard. Will most likely return to this hotel this October when I go back to Shanghai. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very modern but not very comfortable The tower is very stunning. The view from the lobby's quite amazing on a clear day. The Cafe, the Piano bar or the Chinese restaurants all share this amazing view of Shanghai from high up. Just I don't like to stay there. Too much waiting, both for an elevator up to the lobby, or at the very crowded taxi stand. Too many 'outsiders' (non-residents) here and there. Changing elevators is simply troublesome. The decor's modern but too cold. The hotel staff's generally arrogant and unhelpful. It's definitely good but I expect more from a Grand Hyatt. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Impressive views from an impressive hotel Great modern rooms, great views on the city and the river, excellent service "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very Solid Trendy but too cramped My third stay here. Not sure why I keep coming back (perhaps just for the Hyatt points?). Great views when not cloudy or smogged in - so try and hit on one of those 5 days each year. As the hotel is in a tower, the common areas are quite cramped. The bar on the upper levels (85F?) is good, but they have not managed to keep the working girls out - which suprised me for a hotel of this repute. On the upside the guest rooms are great - very modern. Hard to walk anywhere from this location - so need to take a car/taxi. Overall - good for business; would not rate this for a holiday stay. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great but not as nice at the Park Hyatt next door. Stayed one night after returning to Shanghai and before heading to Hong Kong. Very nice, clean, modern. Staff was pleasant, but not anywhere near the level of service as at the Park Hyatt we stayed at earlier in the week. The Grand Hyatt is bustling, very busy both in the evening an morning. Ate both dinner and breakfast in the lobby area restaurant. Quality was fine, but it was very active. Like being in an airport. Service in restaurant was just OK. Similar experience at check-in, not bad, just to the point.The layout of the room and the view were great. The view from the tub and shower were amazing. Decent selection of english language TV to distract me while I was using the internet connection. Very comfy bed. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Standard luxury hotel - met most of my expectations The Grand Hyatt Shanghai has now been usurped by its newer and taller sister hotel, the Park Hyatt. However, the Grand Hyatt is still a very good hotel and one of the best in Shanghai. We booked 2 rooms for a total of 4 nights. The check-in desk is on the 54th floor, and we (my family and I) were given adjoining rooms on the 77th floor. I asked if we could have a river view room, and we were upgraded without hesitation to fantastic rooms with view west towards the Bund and the Pearl Tower. Despite this, except for one waitress in the restaurant on the lobby level, the staff at the hotel did not appear to be warm and friendly, as we had experienced at our hotels in Beijing and Lijiang. The hotel is stunning with comfortable rooms and big bathrooms overlooking the city. Although the hotel is located in the newer Pudong area, access to the other side of the river is quick and easy by taxi as the hotel is located by a couple of cross-river tunnels. Taxis are also cheap and plentiful. The bar on the 90th floor is expensive and over-rated in my opinion. It felt a little cramped. Instead, I recommend the lounge at the base of the atrium on the 56th floor. There is an excellent buffet breakfast with a range of cuisines to choose from. The hotel has great views in every direction, and is very comfortable in a good location with good professional staff, even if they are a bit robotic. Nice spa and swimming pool on the 57th or 58th floor and a very good gym. The fact that it is in a stunning building high above the city with magnificent views gives it an edge over the other luxury hotels in the city. Good bathroom amenities and excellent housekeeping, concierge services etc. My only gripe is that we were charged US$8 to wrap a souvenir. The fact that I was to be charged was not made clear to me when the concierge offered to do this. On this occasion, I felt that I was being &quot;nickel &amp; dimed&quot; by the hotel. Nevertheless, I would definitely stay here again. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Grand Perfection The Grand Hyatt Shanghai is a spectacular property with amazing service and extraordinary facilities. Even if the Park Hyatt (just across the street in the Shanghai World Financial Center) is aiming to surpass the Grand Hyatt, I strongly believe in many ways this particular property will remain at the top of Shanghai 5-star hotels. While the Park Hyatt has more of boutique-hotel feel (= smaller), the Grand Hyatt is, as its name states it, truely grand, with its renowned 35-story high atrium and extra classy decor.For my own stay I booked a &quot;Regency Club&quot; room which I highly suggest yo do if you are considering this hotel. Club rooms are the best : they are located between 72nd and 79th floors (my room was on the 79th) and come with plenty of perks providing a top-notch luxury experience all around. It is really worth spending this premium (approx. 100 $ / night), considering the extras that come with : free in-room internet connexion, exclusive access to the Grand Club (83rd floor), complimentary afternoon tea, evening cocktails and continental breakfast (all at the Grand Club). Take note that the evening cocktails come with plenty of tasty food, which can easily replace a dinner.Upon my arrival at the hotel, as a &quot;Club&quot; guest, I was quickly directed to a separate check-in counter located at the 83rd floor. Everything ran smoothly and my luggage was carried up to my room in the process. I need to mention that the staff at the Club floor are more than helpful and professional : they know (and remember) your name, they are always smiling and polite and speak very good english.My room itself was grand just as the rest. Was I lucky or is it just the way all Club rooms are, but mine was actually very spacious and very neat. Room furniture is both very classy and efficiently designed, with small touches everywhere to increase your comfort level (eg.: room lighting can be controlled on two consoles besides the bed). Bathrooms are remarkable to say the least.I have tried two bars at the hotel during my stay : the Patio Bar (56th floor down the atrium) and Cloud 9 (87th floor). Both were nice yet very pricey. However, I was a little puzzled to be approached twice by a &quot;massage&quot; lady offering me &quot;a lot of beautiful girls&quot; at the Cloud 9 bar. I guess it can just happens everywhere here in Shanghai ?The pool / spa facility (57th floor) is stunning and perfect in every aspect. Certainly the best hotel pool I have seen until now.Location is a minor con (which can be a plus depending on your travel style). Pudong is generally soulless and very business-oriented, giving you more of a Wall Street feel which has very little to do which the real, lively Shanghai. Or course, all the major attractions can be reached by metro from Pudong (short ride), or by cab but be ready to spend a lot a time in traffic congestion at rush hours. However, the Grand Hyatt is just a short walk away from the fantastic park that lounges the Huanpu River.All in all, Grand Hyatt really delivers and fully deserves its 5-star award. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Stunning Hotel but not worth the money Stayed for two nights at Grand Hyatt Shanghai while on business. First off, the hotel is stunning to look at and the attention you receive from the staff is unparalleled. Upon arriving at the hotel lobby on the 54th Floor you are greated with a stunning 20 feet glass view overlooking Shanghai. I stayed in the regular room and chose not to opt for the more expensive VIP floor (higher floor, internet access and breakfast buffet). The room itself was beautiful complete with glass and marble bathroom. Everything was perfect in the hotel. Now the negatives: Shanghai is hosting the World Expo in May 2010 and there is a tremendous amount of construction going on outside the hotel Although you can not hear the construction (as you are on the 60th floor), traffic is terrible. Getting to and from the hotel is a nightmare. I expect it to get better when the constructions are complete (sometime in 2010) but until then, expect to wait in traffic. Second thing, the hotel is beautiful but expect to pay for it. It is incredibly expensive for rooms, food and drinks. If cost is not an issue, then stay. But if you are cost conscious, then you can expect to pay above average for the stay. My stay at the hotel cost me about $750 USD for 2 nights. If you are willing to accept a local brand hotel and a non-prime location, I think you can find much better value for your money in Shanghai. All in all, a great experience. Would I come back? Probably not, I would find comparable properties and save a bit of money. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Beautifull View I really enjojed the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai. The room was so commodious. At night you had to think twice, wether you go to the toilet in your room, because the way was so far ;o). The service was incredible, i needed some business cards and the woman at the counter even translatet it for me in chinese. At the next morning i had my new cards with an english and a chinese side. The buffet breakfast hat a great choice and was very delicious.The view over Shanghai was very nice, because we had a nearly clear sky. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Great hotel but with construction all around.... Loved this hotel. We had spacious rooms overlooking Pearl Tower with good bathrooms and toiletries and complimentary chocolates.....great buffet breakfast. Great choice and delicious. Staff very friendly. Spa/fitness ok. While the height of the building is an obvious attractions smog and concrete dust seem to spoil views most of the time. Showpiece cocktail bar lacked atmosphere and was very pricey. Walking anywhere around the outside of the hotel involves crossing building sites and dodging iron girders and incredibly you can hear drilling from the 60th floor..... 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very Good In Shanghai for only 5 days at a conference. The Hotel was excellent other than a plumbing mishap which was dealt with well. The conciege staff could not have been more helpful. The breakfast was great and the meal at the Club Jin Mao, the setting and service were great though tradiditional Shanhainese is not to my taste! Would have liked more time to explore the city and would recommend the hotel to all. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great Hotel it was great experience to stay in shanghai and with Hyatt ,it became one of the best tour i have been. It was nice to be in Hyatt with family And i am sure you will love it,with family ,friend , or with anyone. i like the way they handled costumers and their amazing service . i have no word for that two day i spend their . from me Hyatt is best hotel in shanghai. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Small Rooms and pricy but it is the tallest hotel in the world Worth staying here if just for the experience of staying in the tallest hotel in the world. The rooms are small with very small double beds. Their Italian restaurant I can highly recommend excellent food with a view and a price to go with it. Their canton restaurant was disappointing. The food was bland and there was no dress code, shame for such a class of restaurant. The service in this restaurant was also rather lacking, not being allowed to order our choice of food! The waiter would not allow us to order a starter and a main course that both contained chicken! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"May be my best hotel experience ever! The Grand Hyatts I visited recently in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong) combine excellent service with a relaxed, feel-at-home atmosphere that I find greatly appealing. The Shanghai property is the best of three excellent hotels. The hotel itself is stunning inside and out - especially the lounge on the 56th floor. The staff was universally terrific - friendly, attentive, professional, especially in the Business Center. They convey the sense that they really appreciated my presence and that they enjoy their work. This was an unbeatable combination for a weary business traveller. The room was comfortable, quiet, and luxurious in an understated way. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great View I stayed in this hotel foe one night. From my room, I can see the river, and the beautiful city, the view is really nice at night with the lights in the city, and I was lucky enough to see a 5 minuts fireworks on the river that night.But the room is quite small, and it is bouble bed size.... the funiture is bit worn down, and the TV is the normal one, not the flat one.The foods are quite nice, I had a free breakfast the next morning.Didn't have chance to use other facilities. It seems to be the middle of the business center, so, it is close to everywhere, guess the location is good, and that is why it is expensive "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great view DIdn't stay in hotel but ate in Canton Restaurant on 54th floor and drunk in CLoud 9 bar on the 89th. Can't find Canton in your restaurant section. I compliment the restaurant on its excellent food, only the wok-fried prawns were a slight dis-appointment and it is very reasonably priced given the location and view. The same can be said of Cloud 9 where prices are reasonable high but not outrageous and there is not an over-use of ice in the cocktails, as experience elsewhere in Shanghai. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Stylish hotel great service Was there for conference at nearby convention center, liked the hotel for its location, style, view, and deco (combination of old chinese charm/deco, with modern furniture, and facilities), the staffs are very friendly. Great view of the city from room, lounge and restaurants. highly recommended. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Fab hotel in Shanghai been to shanghai before but never got the chance to stay here. so, when i get back last march, an opportunity arise, booked this place and stayed for 2 nights. very posh place to stay. romantic if u are staying with a partner/spouse.highly recommend this hotel for a pleasant holiday/business. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Fantastic experience One of the greatest hotels in the world.Fantastic view form our 73rd floor spacious king room. Excellent restaurants with excellent quality and variety of food. Excellent breakfast.The staff very polite helpfull and professional. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great Location The Grand Hyatt in Shanghai is a beautiful 5 star hotel with one of the most exciting views of the city.The Jin Mao tower is worldwide famous, since the hotel has been for ages the highest hotel of the world. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is beautful with the bathtube and the shower looking at the skyline from a huge window.The Grand Hyatt is a little bit old style hotel, at least if you compare it with the newly opened Park Hyatt Hotel just on the other side of the street, but it's still worth a visit!The service is excellent, the food average (and should be improved).You can manage discounted price in groups. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"An excellent experience Stayed here for 2 nights in a queen room on the 64th floor (6411). The room was of ample size, though not extraordinarily large by any standard. With the design of the building it looks like this is probably one of the smallest rooms they have. From looking at the map on the door it looks like they have a variety of rooms of different sizes. Everything about the room was very good however I would say it is starting to show a little age. The TV is not a flat panel and overall the room had a little worn feeling to it. Still it was very clean and everything worked properly. In room internet was 5RMB a minute with a 120RMB max for the day. The service was excellent. The staff were very nice and very attentive trying to help me whenever they could. Both check-in and check-out went very smooth. I would say the only disappointment, which is certainly out of the hotel's control, was that between the fog, haze and pollution the view was really not that great. Everything seemed quite gray this time of year (February). The other thing to consider is the location on the Pudong side of town. Without much traffic it's a quick taxi ride to the Puxi side of Shanghai where most of the tourist, shopping, dining areas are. With traffic it can take quite a while. The metro station is about within walking distance and that will get you across the rive in just a few minutes. If I can get a good rate (mine was 950RMB+various service charges, taxes) then I would definitely stay here again. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Pleasant Stay Overall I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai for 3 nights in Jan 2009 for a conference held at the nearby Shangri-La hotel. I'd been to the amazing 88th floor bar before, so expectations were rather high.Check-in was easy, and the cab driver new exactly where the 'Jin Mao' building in the Lujiazui district of Pudong was (don't ask for the Hyatt, there are like 4 Hyatts now in Shanghai). I and my luggage were whisked quickly up the elevator to the lobby.Check in was quick and efficient, despite there being several people waiting. From there it was a quick ride up to the room. I got one of the 'triangular' rooms, which was fine. I however, like other commentators, found it very complicated to use the infrared desk lamps, which I honestly think should be replaced with lamps with an on/off switch. The room seemed somewhat overdesigned to me, but I did think the closet that was accessible from both sides was genius. The bathroom was great, but in the middle of winter I decided to have a soak in the bath and I must say the water had a rather musty smell to it, but that may be less the fault of the hotel than of the water supply.I thought the food in the cafe was excellent. The hotel does provide the foreign papers in the evenings on request. Everything worked beautifully for me and the service, really, was quite amazing. I even got an email from a concierge yesterday telling me that I'd left a T-shirt in my room and had asked me for my address. Incredible.Departure was similarly effortless. I think for a hotel of its size it does an amazing job at personalizing the experience, and ensuring that guests do feel welcome. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"A Great Stay... This was a quick trip to Shanghai...just a couple days. I had some extra points in my Gold Passport account so I decided to upgrade to a suite (paid rate for the room and then 6000 points for the upgrade) - and I am glad I did! The room itself was amazing. As a little background - we were doing this trip partially to celebrate my partner's birthday. So the suite was part of his present. I emailed the hotel concierge a couple weeks out and mentioned the trip was to celebrate a birthday. In turn, they arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport, a suite on the 82nd floor (85th is the top floor!) and, to top it all off, a birthday cake in our room for him upon arrival. VIP Services met us when the car pulled up to the door and we were taken directly to our room to check in. Check in was quick and efficient - they had everything they needed with them and just validated my credit card. They were even able to accommodate our 3pm checkout request (6pm flight) without any hassles.Room was very well appointed. They classed this as a &quot;Junior Suite&quot;. With the design of the hotel, every room is a corner room; so there are windows everywhere. As one other reviewer pointed out - at that level the views are somewhat hampered by the smog but they are still quite fabulous. We were able to overlook the river, the Park Hyatt (next door) as well as well across the river into the city. Starting from the entry way...you walk into the room to find yourself into a nice sized hallway. Not like many hotels where you feel &quot;crammed&quot; as soon as you walk into a room with closets and such. Here, you have a nice open entry with a table to place your stuff on. From there, a nice small mini-bar area with coffee maker, tea set and nicely stocked bar. You can also enter into a more private closet area just off the bathroom.The sitting room has a nice sizeable working desk, comfortable couch and flat screen TV. I measure the quality of a foreign hotel by the networks they offer - and the Hyatt gets 5 stars (CNN International, BBC, MSNBC, as well as HBO, Showtime and others). The desk had a built-in converter for our US-based plugs so we didn't have to mess with the converter we always bring with us. To top it all off - free internet (although it is not free on the lower floors). The only thing is it isn't wireless (which in this day and age seemed kind of odd to us)...but there was a cable provided in the top drawer and we were set.The bedroom was also very comfortable. The mattress was a little firm for my taste - but not bad. Once again, nice large windows and another flat screen to watch a little TV. The in-room safe is part of the TV credenza. While large enough to hold our camera, passports and wallets, it wasn't big enough to store a laptop. One each bed table there was an individual alarm clock as well as controls for the entire suite's lighting fixtures. The lighting (to me anyway) was a little difficult to grasp. We are not talking simple light switches here...everything was electronic. Each &quot;panel&quot; had an on/off switch, as well as the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Over time, I figured out 1 was bright, 2 was medium and 3 was low. Once I figured that out, it was then remembering what panel did what :)The bathroom was also quite nice. The tub was right up against the floor-to-ceiling windows (!!) but the privacy shutters (full-out wood) offered the privacy you would want. There was a separate shower with rainfall and full-body nozzles. We learned the hard way that the full-body nozzles, pointed the right way (or in this case the wrong way!) will cause water to leak out onto the tile floor. Not a big deal but just something to watch for. Finally, you have direct access to the closet area (which leads then back into the main entry). My only concern here is that it was a little dark. With all my searching I really couldn't find a light switch to make this area a little easier to see in. They offered plenty of hangers (at least a dozen!), slippers, robes and drawers.As for the staff...well, there are plenty of them! Everywhere we turned there was always someone holding open a door, pushing the elevator button, clearing our plates...one thing the Hyatt is not lacking is people. But it wasn't overwhelming. We had drinks one night in the Executive Lounge on the 83rd floor. A nice spread of alcohol and snacks. The view was of the same vantage point as our room, so we didn't see anything new from here. We had breakfast both mornings in the main restaurant off the lobby (52nd floor). While a tad on the pricey side ($30USD each) for breakfast, nonetheless the food was quite good. They had a great collection of local dishes, as well as Western food. All quite fresh...I always saw someone replacing something or refreshing one of the stations...goes back to they have plenty of staff.For Dinner, we went to the Jin Mao Club on the 86th floor. Highly recommended that you make a reservation as it can get quite busy (as we encountered) with a &quot;smart casual&quot; dress code (we went in jeans and polos and they were fine with that). The food was amazing. We had a mix of seafood and traditional Chinese dishes and everything was very tasty. The menu was a little large (2 pages, 8.5x11) and somewhat daunting. But, it also offered a very comprehensive description of what you were ordering so it helped. It offered items as exotic as shark fin to as simple as chicken. We went middle of the road with dishes containing shrimp, chicken, scallops, vegetables and rice. Everything was served in traditional Chinese &quot;family style&quot; so you didn't have to reach over and grab something off someone else's plate just to try it! And while the table is set with chopsticks, the staff will bring you a fork if you ask :) The price point for two people topped a little over $100USD without alcohol.Finally, in regards to the location. Yes, there is a lot of construction in the area (looks like they are building a &quot;W&quot; hotel next door). And yes, the local subway is about a 10 minute walk away. But the walk is quite pleasant (and easy)....just head out the front of the hotel, turn right, go down to the police station (2nd light) and turn right again. Keep walking and once you hit the circular traffic stop, you are there. So what I am trying to say is - it isn't as big a deal as what some of the reviewers may have led you to believe. Kiddy-corner to the subway is a very large (6 or 7 storey) shopping mall. Mainly upscale, but there are bargains if you look. And for those who need a coffee fix, this is the closest location for a Starbucks to the hotel (3rd level, below the Best Buy).Since this is a hotel review, I won't get into a deep review of the shopping. All I will say is, it can be quite an experience. Be prepared for people to just approach you on the street to try and sell you a watch, shine your shoes (or in our case, they wanted to shine our tennis shoes!) or beg for money. In a couple instances, children would run up and grab onto our legs begging for money (with their parents standing to the side)....they wouldn't let go unless you gave them some money. So either try and stay away from them with a quick side-step, or keep a couple $1 coins handy to get them off of you.All-in-all, a great place to stay. Definitely worth what we paid for and definitely a city we will go back and visit again. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Older than the new Park Hyatt across the street but worth a stay. This is a great property located at the top of Jin Mao tower in the Pudong area of Shanghai. Location was great for business but if I had to do it all over again I would've probably stayed at Hyatt Regency on the Bund as that is the nightlife center of Shanghai.Checkin was, with any Hyatt in Asia, a pleasure and the views from the Sky lobby were fantastic (less the foggy-smoggy Shanghai is now known for). Elevator and corridor design was very asian with great pieces of Chinese art on display. The view from the guestfloor balcony to the atrium was incredible. Guestroom was semi-suite in size with great minibar and extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Bathroom was a nice size with bathtub overlooking the skyline. Amenities were plentiful and the shower was a pleasure to use.The only drawback was the somewhat dated appearance of the furniture and tube TV. For the rates we paid there, I expected a 42&quot; flat panel.If you can't stay at the new Park Hyatt across the street, I would stay here. John NYC "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"A great hotel I spent three nights in early December at the Shanghai Grand Hyatt. It is quite a nice hotel, and is described as the highest hotel (in terms of distance from the ground) in the world. From the entrance at the street level, one goes up the elevator to the 54th floor reception lobby to check in. (Below that is the office space). My room was located on the 58th floor, which was relatively low. (The top floor for guest rooms is 85th, and on 86th and 87th are a restaurant and a bar, respectively). My room was of decent size, though not particularly spacious. Decorations and fittings were all very nice, especially the bath room, which had an additional door that opened to the wardrobe. This is a very clever design. The bathroom had a tub as well as a standup shower area right next to it. The shower consisted of three adjustable shower heads arranged vertically to each other and aimed at the upper, middle and lower parts of one's body. The shower was also very powerful, just my kind of thing.On my first night there, I had a quick dinner at the Italian restaurant. The food was good but nothing exceptional. Breakfast the next morning was also good, but not as nice as that in the Beijing Grand Hyatt, my favourite hotel in the capital of China. I didn't try any other restaurant in this hotel on this trip, although a few years ago I had had Chinese lunch and Japanese dinner there. Both were good, but quite expensive. I did take a brief tour of the patio bar on the 55th floor. It's main attraction is that you can look up the 33 floors of atrium that spirals all the way up to the top of the building. It's a breathtaking view, a little sci-fiction like. But I suspect the effect will be more dramatic if it is lighted in blue rather than yellow.I have to say that I was very disappointed at swimming pool, which probably measured only 20 meters in length and three meters in width. Not only was it rather small, there was nothing special about its design or decoration, just very plain and ordinary. I did expect something better from a great hotel located in China's second tallest building. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"World Class This hotel is stunning from the outside and the inside. I upgraded to a Bund View room and ended up on the 72nd Floor. My room was massive, and hard as I tried I couldn't find fault with it.The views are stunning, the furnishings classic, the bathroom is fantastic.Yes its expensive, but then Shanghai is, and for the equivalent price you'd be hard pushed to find a comparable room in London, New York or Paris.Didn't get the chance to try the spa etc (working!) but am sure they are as good. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Wow Awsome hotel. My room was small but as a solo traveller it was fine. The bathroom was absolutely fantastic. View was spectacular and breakfast although pricy was sooo good.On the negative side I could not find that it was really walking distance to anything but taxi in Shanghai is not that expensive anyway. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,great! Excellent hotel. This is the best service you could get in China. The highest hotel in the world has incredible views of the most &quot;occidental&quot; city of China. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great hotel Amazing hotel for an amazing city.We had 2 interconnecting nonsmoking rooms on the 70th floor. I am not great with heights but got used to it!The views are spectacular and a real bonus. Hotel feels like a penthouse oasis from a city which feels like a chinese Manahattan.Staff and facilities top notch, architecture a real bonus. Breakfast sensational. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very good business hotel This is a good business hotel, made more interesting by being so high up (used to be the highest in the world before the Park Hyatt next door opened). We liked it, the restaurants were good, the gym is really great. We changed rooms because the standard one was actually pretty small/poor layout, while the next size up was a significant improvement. We liked it. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very impressive Spacious, quiet rooms. Hyatt Club lounge peaceful and mercifully free of television. Helpful staff speak good English. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great views of.....smoggy skies My secretary booked the hotel for a business trip. I really don't get what the infatuation with these sky-high hotels when the visibility outside is horrendous. The room was dark and made worse given the desk lamp didn’t work (despite multiple requests for it to be fixed). Vicinity is good for business, but nothing else is nearby. Construction makes a 3min walk to the subway take 20mins. My colleague stayed at the Jia hotel on the Puxi side and loved. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Spectacular We stayed here for 4 nights and could not fault it. The room, the service and the food were all 5 +star. Being in Pudong,the view from our room on 73rd floor was spectacular and there was no need to go to any other observation towers.[--] "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Awesome hotel with professional staffing I stayed at the suite of the hotel and it was a great stay. The room is comfortable, big (with living room, corridor leading to the bedroom, so it feels like a one bedroom apartment) and clean. Bathroom is also nicely sized with all the necessary toiletries and LCD tv for the bath. Bed is comfortable. Staff was friendly, spoke English well and professional. Check in was speedy. Everything was just great. The hotel is not that close to any attraction sites (closest mall is about 15 minutes walk away), so that's the only downside, but the hotel which is located in the Jin Mao Tower (2nd tallest building in Shanghai) is an attraction itself, that you can go up the tower to get a good view of the whole city.Overall, highly recommended! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Expect the Best Beautiful views / service / rooms / food - Everything you would expect from a hotel with this reputation - Pure luxury. The spa treatments are also excellent, I had the hot stone therapy. The worst part is the extreamly long elevator ride to the bottom - enough to give you a serious head spin ;) "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Sublime This hotel is surely one of the most unique hotel experiences in the world and we enjoyed every minute of it. What other hotel has such sublime sky high rooms or has a pool on the 57th floor or a bar on the 88th floor?Our family of two adults and two children had two connecting hotel rooms on the 71st floor for four days in July 2008. These rooms were huge, super luxurious and comfortable with outrageous views. This room combination cost us around $AUD600 ($US570) per night, so this hotel is no place for people on a budget. The hotel is very opulent and like most high quality hotels in Asia there are staff everywhere and they are extremely polite. We found both the service and the facilities to be exceptional. The pool and spa areas are fit for a king. The concierge can only be described as expert and dramatically improved the quality of our days out and about.In summary, I can’t really understand why some other reviewers have been critical. I suspect that this is the result of two main reasons. Firstly, the cost could be a bit painful for some and expectations may have got out of hand. Secondly, some of the triangular shaped rooms in the hotel may not as good as the majority of rooms. Look at the floor plan on the back of the room door when you arrive. I am sure the staff would happily move to a more suitable room if you were not happy.Two tips for travel in Asia which are relevant for this hotel:There is no need to be demanding, just ask politely and you will always get better results. Also better service is received by those that dress appropriately. Shorts and T-shirts aren’t always winner in high class establishments. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"What a view!! This is truly an amazing hotel with Jinmao concert hall attached. The lobby is on the 57th floor, so you'll be stunned by the views during check-in (if it's not cloudy). Then up to your room, we opted for windows on 3 sides and couldn't have been happier. Of course this was booked with Hyatt points, so $125 for 2 nights upgrade was an easy decision. The garden tub has a huge window overlooking the Bund and our room overlooked Pudong, the Oriental pearl TV tower, the river, and across to the Bund. We had clouds the first day, but when it cleared on the second day I took most these pictures.Meals were OK, but don't expect alcohol in your drinks at Cloud 9 on the 87th floor. Note that the view from the bar is way better than the tables they tend to seat you at, but the appetizer food is pretty good.Breakfast is cheaper ala carte, and the buffets looked great for those who can eat that much food.It's a good hotel for walking the tourist tunnel across to the other side of the river, up the Bund to People's Square and DO NOT MISS the Shanghai Museum! Definitely the best overall explanation of China's history, art, and life with views of People's square from the second level tea house inside the museum. I could go on about Shanghai, but know that staying in the Grand Hyatt JinMao tower is an experience and the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Way above my expected standards! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Good Service Good Facilities Good Price! After a long journey for a package trip, we decided to stop over at Grand Hyatt before leading back home.It's our first time to stay this hotel since it was opened. It's a majestic hotel, good service, new facilities and good place for business meeting.Just to compare our experienced with the other hotel . In this hotel, I noticed that the staffs are more attentive if they meet a foriegn guests compare to the local guests. Is it because of the tips? For me, If the staff give me a good service then, I will give them some tips.But I noticed that they didn't even greet us when we enter the restaurant.They gave different level of service, but we pay the same price. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"The best thing about this hotel was leaving it. We just spent a few days in Shanghai and thought we'd spend the last night at the Grand Hyatt taking in the view. I booked us a club king room thinking it would be nice to sip a few cocktails with my husband. I still can't believe what a doozy and complete waste of money this hotel is. The vibe is so unbelievably bad. Within an hour of being in our room which had a crappy, disjointed view (wall splits the room in half and takes up most of the view) I was in a bad mood and couldn't really put a finger on it. In the end i realised that the design of the room is so bad that i felt like i was in a box somewhere rather than a supposedly good hotel. My husband arrived a few hours after me and commented that we'd clearly been given a crap room. Anyone who wants to book at this hotel (and i really wouldn't recommend it) should avoid the hyatt's own website and call for a room. He too couldn't get out of the room quick enough which kind of defeated the purpose of staying there. The fittings in the room are cheap, cheap,cheap though they are designed to look like luxury. The bed is not in line with the tv and the tv was some old one stuck in a cheap cabinet and you had to swivel it to see it. This may sound petty but when you're paying US$500 /night for the privilige i think the least they can do is put in a flat screen directly opposite the bed. The bathroom looks ok but again is made of cheap materials so the doors close badly and with some effort. There are too many taps in the shower and most of them squeak like the cheap taps they are.I had to call for an iron and ironing board and when it arrived it looked like it had been taken from a formula one hotel that had been closed down!The club lounge was the worst I've ever been in. The food they served with the 'cocktails' in the evening was inedible. I love food and will eat almost anything particularly when I am starving, which i was. I would seriously advise against paying any extra for club access. The view from that room is also nothing special. The service is bad and they've tacked it on the wrong side of the building.The best thing about this hotel was leaving it. Seriously. I was in a much better mood within 20 minutes of checking out. We spent a few nights at the Regent before hand and the rooms were fantastic. Immaculate, incredibly well thought out, comfy. A lovely big flat screen that you could watch from bed or from the bath (just slide the door along) and great views. I can't believe we left!Shanghai rocks! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Good but not great value My wife and I decided to round off our trip to Shanghai,part business,part pleasure by staying at this icon of the new Shanghai. Pudong, the neighbourhood, is fascinating and a real glimpse into the future. China is normally excellent value but at GBP211.00 for a riverside view with few extras was not great value. Yes, the room was spotless,yes the staff were politeness personified and the views were spectacular.And yet. With the exception of an excellent bathroom (watch out your neighbours can see you!) I've stayed in Holiday Inns with more soul and bigger rooms to boot.Special praise,however, must go to the Piano lounge.Very atmospheric,low lighting, great house band and top service albeit with hefty bar prices and a minimum spend tariff. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,it is expensive expensive!!!!Great!!! 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Eye Candy Location: Perfect! we had planned the first part of our Shanghai stay to take in everything in the Pudong area... Aquarium, Bund, Oriental Pearl Tower and of course, our hotel. No need for a taxi and you can't get lost - just look up, it's currently the tallest building.Pool: Three sided views, clean and for the first time ever in all our years of hotel pools- they had a Liifeguard!Lobby: bit confusing as up and down elevators are on opposite sides of the front desk. Views are spectacular. We stopped a number of times to just look out the windows.Concierge: Very patient and helpful. Lobby Level Restaurant: Just okay. Served European and Asian foods in a buffet.Room: Small but loved the layout. With a hallway entrance it created a great and often needed seperation from the outside. Did not hear a peep. Very glad they had their A/C working as many only have it on by season not outside temperature.Bathroom: Design of the bathtub allowed your neighbor on the corner a pefect view in if the blinds were not closed tight - and then of course there are the year round window cleaners we waved at! This was not an Oooh Aaah space. Nothing special,If you can't stay here, make the lobby level a destination just to take in the views. Amazing day or night. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Very Expensive Hotwl is great but the cost is up 35% from last stay in Jan 2008 yet it was filled 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Nice design but below average services and inconvenient location The best part about the hotel is that it has a good city view. The 33-story atrium showcases architectural prowess. I stayed here in 2006. At that time, customer services were below average and front desk staffs conformed to the stereotype that “Shanghainese think they are better than anyone else”.Room: Well decorated. I liked the bathroom with large window that could look out to the bund view. Location: Located in the business area so not close to restaurants and other happening areas and you must take a taxi to go anywhere.Conclusion: Nice hardware but below average services and inconvenient location. Will not return. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"thde best re coup from a trip to shnagri-la We had a fantastic young tour guide, Tony, book out stay for 2600 Chinese Yuan. We came from Shangri-la, which is more rustic than it sounds. Despite our smelly and dishevelled appearance, the staff treated us fantastic! It was great to see the salary men waiting in line to pay their cover to go to the &quot;Cloud Nine lounge&quot; as we walked right past in our jeans and t-shirts. The service was great and the room was a great refresher from three weeks in the bush in Yunnan province. That was the best hotel ever!!! we had some doubts after reading the reviews, but we are forever glad we splurged "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Majestic but Quirky I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai last November for the second time in 2007. This is an honestly beautiful hotel located on the upper half of what was, until recently, the tallest building in Shanghai. I can assure you that having a room on the 80th floor of any building is eye-opening. However, both times I've stayed there, I've run into a couple of problems. For example, on my last stay, another traveler with the same name as me had checked in just before I did and they gave this individual my room. Not sure what happened to this guy's original room but they seemed to not be able to give it to me and advised me I'd have to settle for something less than what I had booked, as though their error was my fault. While this ultimately got rectified after about an hour, it seemed as though the hotel staff saw nothing wrong with downgrading my room as a result of their error and acted as though my insistence on getting what I had booked was unreasonable. The other thing that (really) bothered me was what I assume was the air freshener they used in their rooms which had an acrid, almost bitter smell that was really annoying. I guess it might have been pesticide or something else but the smell was pervasive and cloying. Not sure I'll stay here again; I think there are enough alternatives in Shanghai so this shouldn't be a problem. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Best place I've stayed in Asia Unique hotel - it is new, well designed rooms and amazing views from windows. There was nothing negative during our staying there. Even if it too expensive for you you should try it for one night )) "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Good but not great Firstly - like to thank everyone who contributes to this site. This is an immensely helpful resource and does wonders for our search for accommodation overseas!Stayed in the Grand Hyatt in Jan 08 on Level 66. The building is definitely impressive, and being so close to the new Shanghai world financial centre, it gives a great view over the current construction.Re: location, as most of the touristy things are located on the Puxi side, the fact that the hotel is in Pudong can be a little inconvenient. However, from what I can gather, there is a subway station not far from the hotel and it is only one stop to the other side of the river. If you can catching the taxi from the Bund back to the hotel, it costs about RMB 20, which is not expensive at all (careful of the traffic though via the tunnel).The rooms are good, but not great. As noted previously, the lighting could better. Given how new the hotel is, I am surprised that the TV is not a flatscreen. Bathroom is fantastic - massive size with a great shower, and a heated mirror as well.No dispute about the views - they are undoubtedly fantastic (on the assumption that there is no fog / smog that day).Not very happy with the service we received at all. Whilst the staff were in general polite, the service we received were some times to be desired. On one occasion, I was in my room watching television (with the door chain on) and received a ring from the room service staff (even though I didn't order any room service). As I didnt any expect any visitors, I didnt answer the bell. The staff proceeded to then knock on the door, OPENED the door (who then found was chained), and then smashed the door open thus breaking the chain. I could not believe that this would or should happen in a 5 star hotel.Further, during the check out - they wrongly charged us for an orange juice even though we didn't take anything from the mini-bar.Buffet breakfast was excellent with wide range of choices. However, per before, the service is still a little crude and need smoothing around the edges. More training is required.In general, would recommend the hotel for business travellers with their own drivers, but not the best for tourists. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"This hotel missed all of its potential This hotel on the surface is amazing - the highest hotel in the world - ridiculous views on Shanghai. The problem lies 100% in the design and planning. Hyatt should be ashamed at wasting such an opportunity. The rooms are okay - lighting is difficult, the bathrooms are a disaster in design - water is always everywhere - saving grace is the amazing view from the bathtub. The restaurant situation is pathetic - either you go incredibly high end chinese or you're in some faux-fancy food court with anti-ambient sound and lighting. The lobby is set up terribly and once again doesn't capitalize on the views. The good parts were the staff - very friendly and helpful, and the concierge club level - although the lighting could be improved. I wanted to like this hotel because the raw space is great - but what a disaster. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Amazing!!! Totally exceeded all my expectations and I can't wait to go back again! I was put on the 78th floor and the gym was located on the 56th floor. Breathtaking views of Shanghai all round and definitely worth every penny! Food was amazing, service was impeccable, the room was super contemporary and more than enough space. The shower and bathtub face the ceiling to floor glass window so not for the faint hearted but for the precious princesses out there who love to travel and be spoilt IN STYLE!! The Hyatt's have never failed to impress me to date and this one topped them all!! You must stay here if you are in Shanghai :) "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Spectacular view... We stayed quite short in this hotel but it was for sure memorable...If you have a partner with fear of heights this is not such a good choice because from the halls were the rooms are you can look down all the way..also from the room same thing with the view on the Bund..I loved the view over the Bund from sitting in the bath or taking a shower and relax..The room is pretty and clean with a good bed, spacious desk and coffee and tea facilities and more..We had Wonton soup in the Grand Café, well do not order more if you try that because the soup was a meal on its own!We had a great time at Cloud Nine on the 87th floor..there was a great magician going to the tables with his tricks and the drinks were good and then I repeat myself I know: the view! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Fantastic! Fantastic hotel! Comfortable, clean and beautiful. Modern with a great view! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"spectacular Ok this hotel certainly ain't cheap, but if you can afford it its worth as its pretty unique. We there for a conference for three nights, and had seriously nice room on the 72nd floor. The view was truly spectacular it is quite something else to open the curtains to that kind of view. The room was a very good size, comfy beds, extremely nice bathroom, a sensible work desk as well, only criticism is the lighting was a bit dim with the exception of the bathroom and the lobby. Service was good, as are the restaurants.It has a decently equipped gym although at 57 floors up the window facing cross trainers and treadmills are not for those who suffer vertigo.You can pretty much just live in the JinMao tower complex if you so desire, there are coffee joints etc in the podium block, and even a minimart in basement 3 (this is not easy to find). Externally Jin Mao tower is a stunning piece of architecture. The location is good by Pudong standards - although much in terms of things to do is in Puxi.Worth it if you get the chance. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Very impressive property I haven't stayed in many Grand Hyatts to compare but this property is a very impressive one with gorgeous public spaces and the rooms were quite good. I had a river view suite; the club on the 83rd floor is very good with late hours and good food and pastry. Being within 5 minutes walk of a metro stop is very useful; it was easier to get to the airport with the metro and change to the maglev train than it was to get to the hotel by using the train and then getting in to a taxi. Concierge and health club were both good. Views from the rooms are not as good as you'd expect since there are many obstructions in front of the windows and the views from the club lounge are the best anyway, but yeah, get a room with a view as long as you're staying there. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great hotel but some quibbles Stayed here for 3 nights as local work office is very close by. Hotel is located in the upper floors of the JinMao Tower (lower floors being office space) with a small commercial/shopping arcade located adjacent. Also close by is the SuperBrand Mall (Zhengda Guangchang) which has improved considerably since my last visit in February. First impressions were the amount of service staff - people everywhere it seemed, even to hold the doors of the express lift to lobby floor open for you! And a lot of spare staff around lobby area at times. Everything appears very shiny and new. Level of English spoken by the staff (especially desk staff and those answering phones) was excellent. Room was a long corridor leading to the bedroom, with a wardrobe between the corridor and bathroom which could be accessed from either side - nice and convenient. View was great looking directly at the Pearl TV Tower. Used the gym facilities a couple of times. The gym itself is very good, as is the spa and steam room. Though I used the pool and as other users have noted, there is someone there that watches you do laps, and it did weird me out a little. Bathroom was pretty special. Big bath, and a shower with an overhead nozzle and two more placed about a metre or so above the floor, though working out how it all worked was a bit of a comical experience. Lots of marble etc etc. Also had room service one night, which though I was told would take 20 minutes, arrived in 10 and was absolutely delicious, and reasonably priced I thought (wanton noodle soup for about 50 or 60 RMB). Room was well decorated and the wood panelling on the wall with Chinese calligraphy was pretty nice to look at. I think a lot of the other pluses of the hotel are summed up well by other people, but here's what my quibbles were:- Whether it was me or the bed, I had three nights of very poor quality sleep when I stayed there.- Desk lamp, which is activated by waving your hand in front of a sensor, is a joke. Sensor would never work properly. Just buy ones with on/off switches already!- There are about six guest lifts in the lift lobby, and two lift buttons at both far ends. This means that if you wait at the far left, and the lift at the far right arrives, by the time you get to it, the lift has gone, and there's no middle button to press to make it wait (unless there is someone in there kind enough to hold it for you). - For a very new 5 Star hotel to have an Akai Guestlink 59cm CRT TV in the room was pretty average. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Life is too short So just once spoil yourself. I rank this hotel as one of the greatest hotel experiences i have ever had. ( we were in the diplomatic suite ) on the 80th floor. I won't comment on the room as most won't use a review of the suite, however if you can afford it. GO 4 it. low season rate was 650 usd per night.The hotel is hugelly impressive and first class in every respect. Security is evident everywhere, cleanliness is apparant and the interior desighn of the hotel is something to be marvelled at.The worlds tallest hotel and highest Bar, well worth having a few beers at just to visit. Even if your staying someplace else.The hotel is very near a subway station and you can easilly commute to anywhere from that point, including under the river to nanjing road. (3 yuen ) The location is also near the super brands mall which in itself is an architects dream and well worth seeing. The hooters downstairs is also a welcome respite for some good old fashion chicken wings and beer.The business lounge at the hotel was great with good service and continental breakfast as well as snacks and treats at supper.Nothing beats a glass of wine on the 86th floor next to a window. WOW.The Cafe restraunt was also very good but i thought the buffett breakfast was a little overpriced considering you could order a la carte for a fraction of the cost.No problems with language, front desk was a breeze, all hotel staff were some of the best ever. carter at the front desk can solve any problem .I will be returning with my family at some point in time and i would never consider another hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"An upper class business hotel We had a very pleasant stay here. The views were obviously amazing and the rooms were definitely worth the price. The bathroom alone was worth every penny!Rooms were well designed and spacious. Bathroom was huge and had a lovely shower! Beds were extremely comfortable and were kitted out with down duvets and pillows. Our request to provide one set of synthetic pillows was handled promptly and courteously.Location is great if you're here on business and need to spend time in Pudong. Otherwise, if you're looking to explore Shanghai, it's a bit out of the way. The metro is only a short 5 minute walk away, but it means you're having to commute where ever you go.Because you're on the other side of the river, getting across to central Shanghai by taxi can be painful at almost all times of the day. We caught a taxi to the train station just before rush hour and we should have avoided that!Staff were very friendly and helped out with directions. They were, however, unable to help us organise train tickets - something which I would have expected from such a hotel.Restaurants and bars in the hotel were good - although by late evening, almost all bars were teaming with prostitutes who were only too keen to chat you up if you spoke English near them. By closing time one felt practically hunted as they tried their best to make their evening pay. Entertaining to say the least!Even if you don't stay here, I'd highly recommend visiting to see the amazing architecture of the atrium that all floors look onto. A hotel in a building of this height is something special and they've made the most of it! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"If you're looking for glamour and glitz (and a price to match)... This hotel is probably deserving of a 5-star rating but I didn't check in until late (past midnight) and I had to checkout to catch a flight early in the morning. The hotel is VERY impressive. The check in counter is on the 54th floor! The are a number of bars and restaurants with the feature attraction being the bar on the 88th floor (I think - I've visited the bar on a separate occassion). The view from the bar is pretty cool too with the city lights et al. The room is large with modern furnishings and a cool/funky designed bathroom and closets. Although, the room lacked an ironing board and iron, which I found odd given how spacious it was. My stay was too short to comment on the hotel ammenities but I will say that it is a VERY posh hotel and if you have the cash to stay there I would recommend you take the plunge, just for the experience. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"I loved this hotel! This hotel was super! My room over looked the Eastern Pearl Harbor. It is located right by the water front and a major mall! Right across the river is the super brand mall with all the fancy shopping. It is located right in the Jin Mao tower, and the hotel lobby is on the 54th floor, so you have amazing views from where ever you are! Inside the hotel there are cool clubs and great places to eat! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great Experience I travel extensively for business and have stayed in many nice hotels and this hotel stands up to any of them. I found the service excellent in every regard. The room was impressive and only exceeded by the view. Location was convenient: a quick and inexpensive cab ride from most major attractions. Ate breakfast and dinner in the hotel and both were excellent. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Awesome Hotel - Overpriced for China The location of the hotel is a far distance from the Pudong International Airport but in a great location within Shanghai. When you enter the hotel, you will need to make sure that you prepare yourself for the 54 story rise to the front desk. The hotel is beautiful with an excellent view for my room on the 60th floor. The room was spacious and clean with an awesome bathroom. I have to say that if I come back for a personal visit, that I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again no matter the price. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Loved it! I think it is probably one of the best hotels in Shanghai, and it definitly has the best view! The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is the CANTON restaurant. It is overpriced and disgusting!! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Left after one night We debatede for so long as to where to stay in Shaghai. Pudong or Puxi, the Hyatt, with all the great reviews, the Shangri La, the upstart. Well, we ended up staying at both. Why? Because the Hyatt must have what is the most indifferent service in the world. When we made our reservation we requested very specific rooms that a guidebook that we like had recommended. As many other reviewers have indicated we got nothing like what we had requested. The room was small, there was only one sink in the bathroom and the view is not what we wanted or had requested. The rooms, though stylish, looked tired and worn and our friend's room had a horribly stained carpet. When we told them at the club level, where we were, that we were leaving almost inmediately, nobody asked why or offered to help in any way. Their indifference was unforgettable. Club level breakfast was meager. Club level happy hour was much better. Club level is small and gets crowdedLoved the views, loved the architecture and actually for a large corporate hotel, the decor, if spruced up a bit could be just fine. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Dross I recently stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights. It is one of the worse hotels I have visited regardless of the cost. The room was dirty upon arrival (toe nails clippings over the floor, hair in the bath and numerous dirty marks). The decor was about 10 years out of date throughout. The bathroom sound system didn't work, the sink took 15 mins to drain, the DVD player cut out twice and the curtain rail was broken. By far the biggest issue was the incredibly poor staff service. They were useless at everything but expected a tip at every turn - which is not common practice in China. Room service waitor put the tray on my wife's jewellery and still expected a tip. That is minor compared to the sheer rudeness of all but one member of staff. Ostentatious day trippers are treated far better than hotel guests. I suggest you take on that guise. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Excellent hotel The Grand Hyatt in Pudong is truely an excellent hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, comfortable and well-run. The views from the inner courtyard (it's over 80 floors!) rivals the views outside. The building itself is an architectural marvel for sure. The restaurants are excellent - we tried two of them. The breakfast and lunch buffets are incredible - enormous choice. We stayed there for three days and had a great time. The staff is very helpful. The only minor issue might be the location. Pudong, on a good day, is hard to get to traffic-wise from the Puxi side (where most of the sight-seeing spots are). So if you are sightseeing you do spend quite a lot of time in traffic trying to get back to the hotel. But overall, an excellent option. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"amazing views We couldn't fault the room.a'Grand de-luxe, Bund view', it was huge and truly luxurious. Extremely comfortable. Unfortunately we always seemed to be in the clouds(smog?), but at night time the lights were magical.The hotel itself starts on the 54th floor, which necessitated quite a lot of change of floors and. lifts; a bit confusing at first.The staff were charming and with the exception of restaurant staff, efficient.The buffet breakfasts and lunches were very good.The only complaints we had were with the restaurants; smokers and non-smokers were seemingly muddled up together, quite illogically, so you could get a non-smoking table next to smokers. The reservation system for dinner in the buffet restaurant was hopeless, we reserved a non-smoking table next to the window and when we arrived at the correct time were asked to wait about 10minutes, at which time we were given a very poor table nowhere near the window, with tables of heavy smokers very near.We tried the Italian restaurant there in despair another night, but again had a poorly placed table, though we hadn't booked, so someone had to have it! I ordered a main course of macaroni. It was penne and was truly inedible, very like the flour and water paste that we made as children ,left to harden. I sen it back and was offered salad or 'something else'. My husband had a seafood tagliatelli dish which he said was OK, so, being hungry, I opted for that. By the time it eventually arrived I was past hunger and we agreed that the tagliatelli was only really just OK. He ordered Chocolate Chip ice cream for pudding and the only chips in it were of ice!To add insult to injury, they tried to charge me for the macaroni, but hastily agreed that they had made a mistake. Nevertheless, I was charged 5 yuan extra for the seafood tagliatelli and by this time we had lost the will to argue.I know---Italian food in China-----. However, at the end of two weeks you do long for a change from Chinese meals and an expensive meal at such a grand hotel should have been better. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Astounding- Gotham City Experience This is an astounding hotel. Being the tallest hotel in the world you are in for an amazing experience in the architecture, design, views and sheer quality of the place. Other reviews have said it all. Its a must visit. Getting into the Clouds bar at night can be tricky (so popular) but worth persisting and experiencing the Gotham City feel..its expensive, as you would expect but worth it. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Number one in Town One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I stayed at the Grand Hyatt twice, once on a business trip and the second time with my wife to explore Shanghai. The view is amazing and the interior of the hotel rooms extraordinary and indeed special for a hotel chain where you usually expect an uniform style rather than arts &amp; crafts of the country. I would suggest to book a Club River view room. The River view is a must and the Club lounge offers excellent food &amp; wines in the evening. Enjoy it; there is no other choice in Shanghai than the Grand Hyatt! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Hated it! I did not enjoy my one night stay at the Hyatt in Shanghai. Definitely not value for money. The staff never smiled (except for those at Oasis - The Spa) and their service were inconsistent. Their rooms are very average. I've stayed at The Westin and JW Mariott in Shanghai, both faired far better. Don't expect flat screen TVs and pay TV. Both unavailable at Hyatt Shanghai. I agree the structure of the building is impressive, but unfortunately, that does little for me when you're inside the building.Food - We tried both the Grand Cafe and Kobachi (Japanese restaurant). The lunch buffet at the Grand Cafe was overpriced and food was very average. Dinner at Kobachi was a waste of time and money. Service was slow - and again, no smiles from the staff. Sashimi weren't the freshest, but you can see the kitchen with Japanese chefs trying hard to salvage what's left of the restaurant. Overall, Hyatt in Shanghai is a 3-star hotel. I recommend The Westin, JW Mariott or the new Mansion Hotel in Puxi. If you must stay at Pudong, try the Shangri-la. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Could be better Stunning hotel from the architectural point of view, has a few disappointing features. Concierge services rates are crazy expensive for Chinese standards and the rooms aren't very impressive. On the other hand, very corteous staff, excellent gym and pool and a few restaurants: I've tried them all and the best one is the Italian. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Disappointing I stayed here in November 2006 on a corporate rate, around RMB 1800. I worked in the Jin Mao office tower circa 2002 when the hotel upstairs was the new luxury standard in Shanghai, so had high expectations for this visit. Instead, I found it to be very disappointing for the price and hotel standard.Although my fiance and I had requested a king-size bed, at our early afternoon check-in we were informed that the hotel was full and we were given a twin bed room. No apologies, no attempt to make up for the mix-up. The room rate did not include breakfast, which I found shocking for a hotel of this standard. Every other luxury business hotel that I've stayed in within China has included breakfast. The room we received was surprisingly small and had an odd trapezoidal shape-- terrible feng shui. More surprising were the large stains all over the bit of carpet in our room. I can live with shoddy carpets at a budget hotel, but it's totally unacceptable for a five star hotel. The bathroom was also somewhat less than spotless,Concierge services appear to be astronomically priced for China. We tried to arrange a full-day driver, and were quoted around RMB 1800 for eight hours, which is more than many Shanghai drivers earn in a month. We checked with other friends in Shanghai who helped us to book another car service at only RMB 500 for eight hours (totally professional, Buick minivan with a wonderful driver).To be fair, the gym, pool and restaurants here are all lovely. It rained heavily during our stay, so we did not have a chance to enjoy the legendary views. But I would absolutely not stay here again on my own dime. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"True Grand Hyatt Style I found the Grand Hyatt to be a wonderful hotel, and after staying in hyatt's all over the world i belive it's one of the best.. service is fantastic staff everywhere, Max the concierge got us great tables and some of the best restaurants in the city..... one word of advice would be to TIP... I would guess that staff really dont get paid that much and if are to make it worth there while things happen very quickly... Tables at the best restaurants on short notice, bags taken to and from rooms very quickley.. ect ect "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"A heavenly room amongst the clouds A modern, beautiful hotel that rises above the clouds! Looking up and down in the atrium as itself a spectacular sight, not to mention the outside panoramic view! We had a deluxe Bund view room on one of the higher floor of the hotel and the views were simply breathtaking, especially at night when the entire city is lit up. The room was nice, with floor to ceiling glass windows all around. The sleek marble bathroom also offered wonderful views. Overall an impressive stay but obviously you will want to request the highest floor possible. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"nice view My family stays at the Grand Hyatt occasionally since we go to Shanghai every year. The lobby is on the 54th floor, so every single room has a spectacular view. The rooms are around 40 square meters, fairly large compared to a typical hotel room. The Cafe is really a buffet with international cuisine. However, one adult cost around 200CNY (25USD) and is increasing every year. The hotel room was around 4000CNY (500USD) per night, which is absolutely ridiculous. Like any place in Shanghai, parking was very difficult to find. The hotel parking lot was very expensive, so we had to park elsewhere. In fact, the traffic and road setup around the building was so confusing that we accidently missed a loop road and went across the river. Across the river, traffic was even more confusing, and we ended up driving an hour just to find the entrance to the hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"nice lift lady service always smilling The view from the hyatt shanghai is spectacular... more so during the night. i just love the service, everywhere you go , there would be someone to smile at and say hello to. ( Hyatt staff ) It made me feel welcomed and special. Please look up when you sit at the coffee lounge... a small problem is nobody seems to speak english. An international hotel should ensure at least all the staff that meets customers should at least speak basic english. a minor inconvenience , though those eager beaver to please attitude was thoroughly admirable.The rooms are simply majestic, not as good as grand hyatt singapore but better than grand hyatt jakarta. Well the hyatt singapore has just been refurbished so ... I do not like the switches they use , it looks cheap without attention, the bed was grand and the chinese words on the head bed made me a little wary. Also they dont have LCD Flat tv like hyatt singapore.The gym and swimming pool is great, the locker system a little confusing but someone is always there eager to help which is a must for foreigners.Just across the street there is a golf driving range, a good way to unwind. Food is great in any restaurant though they do not have cili padi, or small chilli.. well you cant have everything , overall an 8/10. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Great for a romantic night stay My finace had to move to Shanghai from the USA for 8 months. I went to visit him for two months and we thought it would be fun to stay at the Hyatt for a night. I cant tell you how great our room was. We were on the 67 or 68th floor in a room over looking the river. Our room was on the corner and had floor to cieling windows 180 dergee view. The garden tub also had a window with a very nice view. The bathroom was just wonderul. We ate at The Grill in the hotel which was nice. The cloud 9 bars has great view as well. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Room in the clouds My girlfriend and I were able to get a couple of tickets to the F-1 race in Shanghai and we were able to book a suite at the Hyatt. The hotel is centrally located in the city and about 45mins from PVG airport. We arrived late afternoon and went through the customs rush hour at the airport. We were met at the airport by the hotel staff and quickly taken to a car. I would recommend booking the hotel car, as taxis are difficult to come by at the airport. Like its sister hotel, the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, we were met on the ground floor, and quickly taken to check in on the 54th floor. Despite the hotel being fully booked for the race, the hotel staff was efficient and proffessional. We finished the check in process in our room on the 83rd floor. The suite consisted of 2 connecting rooms, a bit small and choppy. The rooms were well appointed but the furniture and furnishings are a little dated and worn. The bed was very comfortable, and the bath a little crowded and despite the 2 separate sinks, was a little small for 2 people to share at the same time. The view however was spectacular. I awoke early one morning to the sounds of construction and I couldnt understand how I could hear this on the 83rd floor. I looked out our bedroom window and saw another building about 20 floors below us going up. We tried the Japanese restaurant which was very good, we also had desert up on the 87th floor with another amazing view of Shanghai. I arranged for a hotel car for an early flight back to HongKong, the hotel arranged for a &quot;picnic style&quot; breakfast to be served in the car, a very nice touch. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Stunning Architecture Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai September 8th through the 12th.The property is architecturally stunning. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (Sears Tower Fame), and is 88 stories tall. The first 53 floors are offices. The lobby of the hotel is on the 54th floor and the hotel extends to the 87th floor. The 88th floor is an observation deck.The Grand Hyatt has an open atrium that extends from the 55th floor to the top of the building. Contains the world's highest hotel rooms, and is the world's tallest building with a hotel inside. My room was on the 67th floor! If the view of Shanghai is’nt good enough from your hotel room, the Cloud 9 Lounge on the 87th floor is incredible and provides views of the entire city. Also, there is a lounge at the base of the hotel’s atrium.The finishes are beautiful – lots of stone and polished metal. Looks great considering the building was competed in 1998. The property’s food and beverage are OK but nothing special – there are like 6 restaurants – two Chinese, a Japanese, and the rest are American. Honestly the food is overpriced (you can go to Wampoa Club, one of the nicest restaurants in the city, for less money). The two lounges I mentioned before are great.The fitness center is amazing as well – it’s on the 57th floor, and also offers great views of Shanghai from the pool area and Jacuzzi.As far as the service goes, nobody bends over backwards for you but everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Nobody is smothering you with service, which probably comes from the fact that the hotel has 555 rooms. The concierges are more than happy to book a table at any restaurant in the city. They give good directions and also offer very good recommendations for things to do. English is a bit choppy across the board.The Grand Hyatt deserves to be at the top of the list in Shanghai for architecture alone. The rooms are also great and when I stayed the rate was only 1900 Yuan per night. Don’t expect to be wowed by the service. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Bad bad service I was very much looking forward to staying at the Grand Hyatt. It looked amazing and indeed it was very impressive - a hotel whose top floors on most days are above the clouds! As regards architecture and structure and views it did not let us down. However from the offset it is obvious good service is not something you get at this hotel. The check-in desk staff were unhelpful and their supervisor/manager was just rude. We had booked 2 rooms at the same rate - all agreed in advance with Hyatt reservations. When we arrived at the hotel they upped my friends' room rate with no explanation. I had to barter (Good Old Shanghai, eh?!) and got some moey down but it ended up being £50 more expensive a night than reservations had told us. Not one word of apology, he was just stroppy and rude. But we needed to sleep having flown overnight from London so we checked in anyway.Rooms very nice. Comfortable large beds, huge bathtub and separate shower. Lovely bathrooms. TV ok. Views were amazing (we were on 78th floor!) when the clouds weren't there (one of the four days!) but throughout the hotel service is poor. The only exceptions are the 'lift girls' who hold the lift for you, the Concierge and the gym/pool/spa staff, who should really teach the receptionists/bar staff etc good service as they were impeccable.I've seen the view now so I'm afraid to say I'm unlikely to stay there again. Especially as we booked a car to pick us up from the airport and were quoted £40 sterling and upon checkout they tried to charge me £80 sterling. I got than £40 back though. It's a shame the service is so poor as the hotel itself could be amazing - the building lends itself to that. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great Views and Room but An Unpleasant Stay On our fourth visit to Shanghai (one of our favorite cities) I decided to splurge and spend one night at the Grand Hyatt. We had eaten meals there and I thought it would be a fun to place to stay.The good part about the hotel is the amazing architecture and jaw dropping views. It is a phenomenal building. Everything is very modern and slick but it felt cold. Plus, there is not enough attention paid to the details in the upkeep of the hotel--scuff marks, stains and cooking odors in the hallways, etc.Right from the onset the staff acted very cold and stiff. They won't let you change money without showing your passport, even though they took a photo of it when you checked in twenty minutes earlier. You can't swim in the pool (which is quite small) without wearing a bathing cap. There are some very odd warnings in the back of the guest book (the hotel will prosecute you if you entertain prostitutes, pass out prohibited material in the hotel, etc--I have never seen anything like it in a Chinese hotel before) Although the food was very good, it is served with few smiles. All in all, we did not feel welcome at this Hyatt.The rooms are slick and showcases the view perfectly. The decor is dark but the view is really magnificent (despite the pollution which is a given in China). The bathroom is fancy which tons of dark marble and chrome but is cramped.Once you leave the hotel you are pretty much in the middle of nowhere. I asked the concierge about places to walk to and he said there wasn't much. After wallking past emply mud lots and construction sites we wound up at the river front. We had a fabulous walk there, looking at the bund and the ships on the water (rhere us also a great aquarium and a lovely Shangrila Hotel with a very friendly staff).After one night we did an early check out and hurried back to the Four Seasons where we had suite for a lot less money. Perhaps our view wasn't the greatest at the Four Seasons but we felt so much more welcome and the staff is much kinder. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Left with mixed feelings I recently stayed for 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai. I booked this hotel mainly because of it's design (the building and the rooms) and the fantastic view. I booked a Grand Deluxe River View Room and added access to the Grand Club Lounge. The room and the bathroom which were in the 64th floow were both quite spacious. The room features two floor-to-ceiling walls of glass which offer an amazing 180 degree view over Shanghai. In the evening hours the view is incredible.The room itself was well appointed and clean. The carpet looked a little bit worn. The bathroom was clean and there were plenty of towels and two robes and slippers were provided. The bathroom also has a large window by the bath tub with a great view over the river.Room service was good, turndown service was provided, privacy was kept when the do-not-disturb-sign was switched on (which is not the case in all hotels).However, while the room and bathroom are 5 star standard the service was not:Booked limousine transfer but no car was provided and I had to take a taxi.Booked non-smoking room which was confirmed at booking - still got a smoking room.Fresh fruit was delivered only on some days - seemed to be dependant on the mood of the maid. Same goes for the newspaper.Service personnel was quite distant with a few exceptions. You could easily sit in the Grand Club Lounge for 30 minutes with no waiter approaching you to take your order for a drink. Help yourself!Snacks and canapees in the Grand Club Lounge were ok during evening hours, although not exceptional.Breakfast was ok only. Have had much better breakfasts in other hotels.No dress code enforced at the Grand Club Lounge. Also, young kids are allowed in as well. It get's very noisy at times.Hotel lobby is very noisy as plenty of non-hotel-guests linger around for the great view.Missed genuine friendlyness throughout the hotel.As for dinner, I only tried the Jin Mao Club on the 87th floor. The service was good and the view is of course fantastic. However, the food was very bland and not nicely presented. The only decoration was two pieces of brocoli. Also, advertised as the 'most exclusive dining' in Shanghai you would expect the restaurant to enforce a decent dress code. Instead you see plenty of people in shorts and sandals and kids running around. Very disappointing.All things considered, still a good hotel. While I would give it a 5 star rating for the room and bathroom, I would give a max 4 star for the service. The restaurant even less...I recommed to go there for the view and the nice rooms. But don't expect outstanding service - you won't get it. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Less Than Impressed So I was in Beijing for business (stayed at the Peninsula which was amazing), and decided to come to Shanghai for the weekend for pleasure. Everyone I talked to state-side and in Beijing said to stay at the Grand Hyatt because it was the very best in Shanghai. It was also very expensive, but I decided to go with it because I wanted to treat myself. While the hotel itself (building, lobby, views, etc...) is extraordinary, I am very disappointed in my VERY expensive room. I have a king river view room which cost $280/night and is nowhere near as nice as the room I had just come from in Beijing which was $100 cheaper per night. The location, I am starting to find, is rather troublesome as well, it seems that the majority of &quot;excitement&quot; is on the other side of the river...which is not a far distance, but the traffic is so horrible that it always takes a MINIMUM of 30 minutes by taxi.All in all...it's an odd situation. Beijing, the town that is supposed to be so much less-sophisticated than Shanghai, I had for less money a MUCH nicer room that included free limo to and from the airport and breakfast. In Shanghai, where I am &quot;supposedly&quot; staying in the best place in town by everyone's accounts...the room is MUCH more expensive, not nearly as nice, car service is an additional $60 each way, and the breakfast is an additional $25. The most annoying part to me...the AC in the room is not that effective. I like a COLD room, especially when it is 95 degrees outside...and on the coldest setting the room is just ok.I'm too lazy to switch hotels at this point, but from what I've heard there are many hotels on the other side of the river that are nice and cheaper. I would recommend those. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"OK for business not for a weekend I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a conference recently and stayed on for the weekend. That was a mistake. The hotel is most notable for its views, but the air in Shanghai is so filthy that most days the views were quite limited. Given the prices, the room was small - at least too small for a couple with a baby. The choice of restaurants and cafes was also limited, with no basic coffee shop to pop into for a drink and a snack.Worst of all, there's nothing around the hotel, so we needed a taxi to go everywhere. But with no pool or outside space at all, we had no choice.On the upside, the food was good and the staff extremely helpful. I'd certainly recommend this hotel for a single businessman or woman, but not for a family and definitely not for a holiday. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Heaven in the Clouds I loved my three day stay here. I had a lovely king bedded room on the 77th floor facing the Bund and the Oriental Pearl. The room is beautiful. A bit overstated but all in all remarkable.Dining was good in the hotel. I had an excellent Australian steak in the Grill. The buffets offered in the Cafe were very good although no bargains. I was only frustrated by the RMB45 price of each and every glass of iced tea. Sorry but that is excessive. Drinks in the Bar on 54 were reasonable for deluxe hotel and the service was good. The Cloud 9 bar did not live up to expectations. The drinks were excessive and the room is quite small. I think the service was notched up a bit in the attitude department. All in all, lovely. Definitely an expensive stay but if you love really good hotels as a fun getaway -- then this should go on your list. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Grand Hyatt is heaven on earth The Grand Hyatt is heaven on earth and a world unto itself. From the time you enter its private entrance in the Jian Mao Building (the 4th tallest in the world), it is pure luxury.The hotel is located on the 53rd to the 88th floor and my room had an incredible view looking over at the Pearl TV Tower and down upon the surrounding skyscrapers.The room and especially the bath were very comfortable and luxurious.Not sure how much of a value the hotel is as was given a very special discount due to my company's affiliation with hotel.Many restaurants and lounges to choose from, but all are veryb pricey. Do not miss a cocktail in the Cloud 9 and The Patio. The Garden Court Restaurant (main floor) does mainly buffets, but a la carte is also offered. Dinner buffet was quite good, with lots of fresh seafood. The hotel has a beautiful spa and indoor pool. While in the building, you can take the elevator to the Observation Deck for a price. A bit of a carnival scene up there and of course very crowded.I did not care for the location of the hotel, but then I never left to venture out into Pudong.I much prefer staying across the river looking over at the amazing architecture of Pudong. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Superb Even if this wasnt the worlds highest hotel, it would still get five stars. Everything about this place oozes class, from the beautiful bedrooms, the spotless and brand new building to the attentive staff. Add in an exceptional pool and spa complex (highest in the world), the worlds highest bar, a number of good restaurants etc and you have a superb package. The location is less of an issue than expected - four metro stops from the Maglev terminal (take Exit 5 from the metro or you will NEVER get across the 8 lane highway!) and a 10 minute walk from the &quot;mere words cannot describe it&quot; Bund tourist tunnel. It is not cheap but you really cannot go wrong here unless for some reason you need to be on the Puxi side of the river. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Do not stay here if you are a tourist We had agonised long and hard about which hotel to choose for our first visit to Shanghai and finally plumped for the Grand Hyatt as it is clearly the hotel of the moment. When we arrived we asked whether we could change our booking, which had been for a Bund Twin Room (all they had available at the time) to a King Room but were told they were completely full. However they could offer us a Bund Queen Room on the 71st floor. Now they claim on their website that the average size of these standard rooms is 40 sq m, but in our room at least 15 sq m were accounted for by the hallway. The bedroom was tiny, barely room to walk around the bed which itself was suspiciously small for a queen size. The bathroom also was an odd shape, with just one sink and the cheapest selection of toiletries I have ever seen in a 5 star hotel (local, non-branded, nasty). The biggest disappointment, however, was the view. Again on the website they show pictures of wonderful ceiling-to-floor glass windows overlooking the Bund. Due to the design of the building, however, beyond a certain floor level the windows are in fact heavily cross-framed with thick iron girders meaning the view is far from visible unless you stand right next to the pane. We called reception to complain about the size of the room and were told that many rooms in the hotel had such odd (and inefficient) shapes due to the &quot;unique design of the building&quot;. However they would call us in the morning if a better room became available. As we had arrived late and were tired we decided to try the Italian restaurant in the hotel. When we walked in it was like walking into a canteen - small tables (with no tableclothes) lined up along the window, almost every one occupied by (largely) American businessmen in suits and their Chinese hosts. The service was so fast that we were out in less than an hour and the quality of the food was distinctly average given the high prices - approximately 70 pounds a head including for two courses and an indifferent bottle of wine.We had booked to stay for 5 nights but by this stage had decided that this really wasn't the hotel for us. Aside from the disappointment with the room, it seems that this hotel is entirely geared to the business traveller. As we would learn over the next few days it's location for a tourist is truly terrible - on the wrong side of the river in a town where taxis can be like gold-dust late at night; surrounded by two large building sites; and a ten minute one-way system to enter the traffic tunnel to where you really want to be which is itself heavily congested night and day.The next morning we were not surprised when reception didn't contact us to offer a new room. When we checked out we were not asked why we were leaving four days early - only the doorman seemed surprised when we told him we wanted a taxi to the Four Seasons. I am sure if we had stayed put at the Hyatt we would have had a very much inferior experience of Shanghai. We loved the Four Seasons - its location, atmosphere and staff - and would urge anyone who doesn't absolutely have to stay in Pudong to stay on the other side of the river. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"A perfect city hotel This is a first-rate 5-star hotel in every way. It's beautiful, sleek, well-staffed and it has the most magnificient views. It also has several great restaurants, bars and a nightclub all in the same building. I especially liked the piano lounge with live music. The beds are extremely comfortable, linens are top quality, and the power showers are awesome. Splurge and pay for a room on the executive floors. Its lounge offers an amazing breakfast and cocktail spread. Given all this, this hotel is a bargain. I could go on and on about how fabulous this hotel is. I've stayed here 4 times and each time, it was a fantastic experience. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Good hotel but at an expensive price I am in Shanghai over 30 times a year and try the Grand Hyatt every now and then out of curiosity. Service has improved noticeably since a year ago. The view on a good day is impressive and I would certainly recommend all first timers to Shanghai stay here. Breakfast and room service are both of excellent quality. Downsides - getting very expensive now at around US$250 or so per night in peak season (like now). This is in a country where GDP per capita is only US$1,000 p.a.! But it's very crowded with loads of tourists and business people. The atrium style internal design means that public areas can get noisy. And because of the crowds room preference is sometimes unavailable unless you have super frequent stayer status. Rooms can also be strange as the design means there are many shapes. Astonishingly enough there are no HBO or Cinemax programmes in the rooms. All in all, still a good hotel but value for money is average only. I prefer the St Regis as it is quieter, less expensive and has bigger rooms. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Loved the Grand Hyatt Stayed the week of February 5th. The view was incredible. Staff was very attentive. Rooms were very clean. Whenever we called the front desk for more bottled water or towels they were at our door within minutes. The lounge on the 56th floor is a nice relaxing place to unwind after a day of touring.I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt. 
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Grand Hyatt...Grand Experience! My stay at the Hyatt was simply perfection! The rooms have floor to ceiling windows with views that will blow off your socks! They have extremley comfortable beds and cool bathrooms with a tub overlooking the city! The restaurants there all all top notch but Canton by far sticks out from the rest....true authentic cantonese food...the peking duck is out of this world! Cloud 9 is a great place to end the night with a nice drink and dessert. PU-J's was a great place for entertainment..in the back they even have a nice dance club..when i went it was empty but they played great music...it was so much fun even though it was just my husband and i dancing. The breakfast buffet is great...they have some really fresh fruit. The gym is small but very clean with spectacular views as well. If you like to swim they have a huge indoor pool...the spa is ok. Overall, wonderful experience...it's definately worth the money! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"5 star view only We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for the Chinese New Year to enjoy the view to the BUND and the fireworks in Shanghai. Undoubtedly, the view from the rooms is really great and we could really enjoy the celebration taking place in the city.However, altogether, the hotel did not live up to our expectations. This does not mean it is a bad hotel but considering the value for money and the smile you should have on your face leaving it (after a leisure stay)...it does not get it right.The room:We had a grand suite. This is basically a bedroom with a little big bigger study attached. It really shouldn't be called suite and the design is quite odd since a lot of space is wated for the doorway. On the positive side, the room is still very new and the bathroom is georgeous. Really great with BUND view from the bathtub and TV :)The room service on the other hand is not on par. They do the standard things right, however, they didn't vacuum, even though there were obvious traces of bread on the floor. The day before, the room was set for three guests, after cleaning, everything was just available for 2. Basic things were missing...Club Floor:The breakfast and the &quot;happy hour&quot; at the club floor were better then average. The breakfast is limited in its choice but ok. The service is ok. Friendly but nothing more. The manager still needs a little practice, since I told him a couple of my complaints but no reaction at all. He even bothered us with some odds things that were no of our concern.Service overall:Only ok. Downstairs during the day, the service is ok, however, mainly busy with tourists visiting the lobby or one of the restaurants. When it becomes evening and mainly hotel guests come through the entrance, it seems that the service people are really tired and don't care too much anymore. At the check out, the only purpose was to collect our money. In no way they tried to ask us if we enjoyed the stay or anything else.Summary: Go for the view if you are willing to spend the money, but stay in your room and don't set your expectations too high. I think as a business traveller they will be able to treat you right, since you will be busy most of the day and just return to the room during the evening...but then there are either cheaper or better choices. As a leisure traveller, most likely you will be disappointed (as we were).P.S.: When we went, we saw the mixed reviews however, the hotel was still ranked #1 in the traveladvisor list...next time I checked it was #11 :( It fits the hotel better! but if this would have displayed earlier, it would have definetely influenced our choice. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great Hotel I work in the travel industry and am fortunate to have stayed in some brilliant hotels. The Grand Hyatt along with its namesake in Hong Kong are the best hotels I have ever stayed in. This one is impressive in scale and appearance; all the staff I met were friendly and helpful; and the 2 restaurants I tried were both excellent. The hotel location is a bit awkward being surrounded by busy roads and on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the river. However, taxis are cheap. Shanghai itself seemd a bit sterile, lacking the vibrant atomsphere of Hong Kong, and visually its an impressive skyline but best at night.Would I stay here again? yes as long as someone else paid. Shanghai, makes an interesting 2-3 day stopover, but not a holiday destination. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Impressive but expensive and sterile - Hong Kong is better. I stayed in The Hyatt as it was ranked as No1 in Trip advisor for Shanghai. Had to go to Shanghai for work from 12th to 16th January 2006.The hotel is my opinion is over rated. I have stayed in serval Chinese cities on business and most hotels are of a mediocre standard. This hotel has the potential to be the best in class. I has an incredible presence with 89 foors. The first 53 floors are offices (from a differnt entrance.) Floor 54 is reception. The health club and pool (very nice indeed) are on 57th floor and the posh restaurant is right on the top on the 89th !! We are talking Empire State building proportions here. There is another hotel going up next door - due for completion in 2007 with over 100 levels so both hotels will become a world landmark. (the locals are slightly concerned about this in view of 9/11) So it's impressive, the rooms are good, the views are of Shanghai are OK . Shanghai is not the prettiest city in the world. Accomodation for 15 million people has been planned and built within the last 20 years so it really is 200sq miles of wall to wall concrete. So why didn't I like the hotel ? Firstly it is very expensive. Beware - local taxes and service charges add 25% to the prices quoted here. This is one of the most expensive hotels in China and although the staff are polite (rather than genuinely interested) - there is no 'ambiance'. The whole place feels sterile. You can eat in silence in the restaurant and pay £30 for your meal - or go straight across the road to the Chinese restaurant (with yellow seats) The Golden -'something' - and eat fresh fish, meats and steamed vegetables including beer for under £5. It was delightful. Shanghai was also a bit disappointing. It tries to be the new Hong Kong - but for me HK will always outshine with intersting and bold high rise architecture, endless selections of hotels, shops and restaurants to suit all budgets. HK has great night life and feels really safe. Not sure i felt quite as safe in Shanghai. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"So overrated it's not funny... don't waste your money! My husband and I travel over the holidays each year and decided this year to make it Shanghai.Since we figured we probably wouldn't make it back to Shanghai in the near future, and we were going to be there for about 10 days, we decided to stay at a few hotels, and that the Grand Hyatt in the fourth highest building in the world should definitely be one of them.Since we would be staying there on 31-Dec and 1 &amp; 2 Jan, we thought we would spring for a Bund View Suite to make it really special, which was about $350US or $500 Australian.We took a taxi from the Portman Ritz Carlton, the hotel we were staying in prior to this, and found straightaway that the area around Pudong looked boring and depressing, with a few tourist stops and nothing much else.When we got to the check-in desk on the 54th floor, it was jam-packed, so we were happy to learn that, since we booked a rate with club access, we could check-in on the club floor, floor 83.We were greeted by a very snooty club check-in person and shown to our suite on the 82nd floor. I must admit, the suite was huge, and the view was very grand.The check-in person, of course, played that up as much as possible, and then followed us around the place for a full 10 minutes or so waiting for a tip, even though we had already thanked him and made it clear that wasn't going to happen.Normally, we are good tippers, however in this instance, this was not the person who brought our luggage. All he had done was check us in. In addition, in Shanghai, there is a 15% service charge which is intended to cover such service, so that a tip on top of that would be ridiculous. Indeed, nobody at the other hotels we had stayed at (Westin &amp; Ritz Carlton) had expected nor waited around for a tip.For heaven's sake, we were already paying $500/nt... it was downright rude of this person to hassle us for a tip!Just to top it off, we realized a bit later that the bed was only a queen size bed, and we had paid for a King bed suite. At this point we were too angry to even bother complaining.The club was reasonably well-stocked, but was very very packed. So much so that we had to ask if we could move a chair to create a table we could sit at. A staff member who looked very put out by us reluctantly moved the chair so we could sit.There were also many children in the club, some of which were running around screaming and sticking their filthy hands in the buffet.Again, for the price we were paying, I would have expected a little peace in the lounge and certainly not having children sticking their hands in the buffet.And I would have expected the staff to be both better trained to serve their guests, rather than looking put out by it.Several times in different areas of the hotel, I was asked by staff &quot;may I help you?&quot;, which made me feel as if they were questioning my right to be in a particular area.When I visited the pool, I was the only one using it, and a staff member was assigned to sit along the side and watch me... I couldn't figure out why? To make sure I wouldn't steal anything? That's the way it felt.While the view was gorgeous, and the hotel very elegant, we were made to feel most unwelcome the whole time we were there. So much so that we checked out two days early, only staying for one night, and moved to the puxhi side of the river near Peoples square, which is much more centrally located.My advice to anyone thinking of staying here is to save your money. Take a day trip to Pudong (that's all you'll need, it's pretty boring) and have a drink up at the bar at the Grand Hyatt, and choose a hotel such as the Westin which is less expensive, more friendly and more centrally located.

"
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Shanghai landmark worth staying This is an absolute must see destination in Shanghai - even if you are not staying in this hotel. Even the high price of rooms Grand Hyatt should not put you off when considering hotels in Shanghai. For a day or two at least. I stayed at the Executive Floor (Grand Club) - on the topmost floors with its own check in facilities. I do not think that the views or services differ very much if you decide to stay a couple floors down in a standard room. The room was absolutely great and the views even better. My room was so high up that clowds prevented the view over to the city most of the time. However even walking next to the floor-to-ceiling windows makes those ones of us who are afraid of high places shiver. Centre of Shanghai and especially Pudong side of the city resembles Gotham City (from Batman, the movie) and the Jin Mao Tower where this hotel is located is a star reminder of that. The small details in rooms are great: heated mirrors that do not fog when you take a shower, lights that switch automatically on when you walk to the room etc etc. They have really paid attention even to the smallest of details at this hotel. Location: As Grand Hyatt is located at Pudong side of the city it is in a somewhat awkward location. Jin Mao Tower is surrounded on all sides by broad motorways and crossing these is next to impossible by foot. There is an underground station some 500 metres from the hotel but getting there is a problem as crossing the streets take ages - and is dangerous. So you should rely on taxis and take into account that getting to the otherside of the Pearl River may take even 1-2 hours at peak times. Despite of the seemingly short distance.I prefer outdoor pools which this hotel does not provide. However the indoor pool at Grand Hyatt and the excerise rooms were absolutely superb.Remember that even as a guest at this hotel you are constantly overlooked. Elevators, corridors and all other public areas are constantly monitored and if you actions apper suspicious to the overlookers you will immediately get a voice responce. I once tried to get to the opmost floor restaurant which was not open at that time and immediately after pressing the elevator button I got a voice responce from the &quot;overlookers&quot;: &quot;Sir.. may I help you... the restaurant is open only in the evening...&quot; You'll see cameras all over the cenre of Shanghai taking a good look of your actions. Shopingwise, there is no better place than Shanghai. So leave a lot of room in you luggage for all the things you end up buying! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"A must visit destination Location: It’s at a convenient point at Pudong: a short stroll to the Superbrand Mall and the Oriental Pearl TV tower. The St Regis is way up further but the Shangri-La is closer to the river (for postcard view of the Bund). If location is paramount, the Portman Ritz is next to Plaza 66 for luxury shopping and JW Marriott is in the centre of Nan Jing Road (between Ritz and Westin).Décor/Design: If you are overwhelmed by the Peninsula Hong Kong or most Ritz Carltons and rate highly on their décor, then the Grand Hyatt would slightly disappoint you. As a modern architect, I would prefer a modern design with a respect to the history/local culture, so you feel the essence of a particular country but still on the right track of time. Grand Hyatt embodies this concept. It is not as minimalist as Park Hyatt Tokyo, but not as culturally-infused as the old Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (now being refurb). Hyatt incorporates the golden day of Shanghai’s art deco style with modern Chinese; and the result is excellent. Even the building (Jin Mao Tower) by top US firm SOM is truly breathtaking, one of my all time favorite buildings!. It even impresses my old-fashioned mother!Lobby/Public space: Although large (500 plus rooms), Grand Hyatt is surprisingly small inside, it almost feel ‘boutique’. You have to change 2 lift banks from ground to lobby; and to your room. In between is the lobby with double story lounge area and breathtaking bund view, which can be overcrowded in the afternoon with tourists taking photos or tour groups flocking the lobby.The much publicized 30 storey atrium is smaller in reality, but still awe-inspiring. There is a lobby lounge on its base with no view so unless you have a good conversation, staring at the atrium could be boring and dizzying after a while.Rooms: Opt for the Grand Bund View room for an extra! The view is truly impressive with views directly to the Oriental TV tower, aerial view of Bund and Shanghai’s skyline. Be careful when choosing room, as the building’s design is tapering to the top, so some rooms can be smaller than the other; rooms on the corner side are larger (still standard room) than in the middle. Standard room is 40m2, but my gold passport room at Level 71 is much much larger as it sits on the corner. What you see in the brochure is exactly what you get. The bed headboard is adorned with Ming dynasty poet, which is quite special. The window is from floor to ceiling with a lot of horizontal frames in between which might obstruct looking at the view. There is no sofa, but a relaxing chair with ottoman. In the brochure it was said there are wireless keyboard to connect to TV, but in reality this service has been cancelled, I guess some of the mainland clients must have took it home. Bathroom supposes to be big, but the layout makes them feel smaller. I particularly dislike the flimsy glass door for the WC, I mean how does it work with the acoustic (remember hot shanghai food)??. But the amenities are nicely packed as a souvenir. Noise: My room shares a wall with the lift shaft, but we could hardly hear anything!. In fact the only noise we encountered is a constant yelling from a mainland customer next door, which is very annoying!. I hope it’s not how they talk because I swear it feels like a battle ground.Food: Didn’t try the buffet there, but the Cloud nine has fantastic view. The food court (by Hyatt) on the basement should be avoided.Facilities: Swimming pool has views over Shanghai, which is fantastic.Service: Polite, efficient and personal. You were whisked directly to your room by one of the receptionist where he introduces the room. But on one visit to the business centre, one of the lady there did not understand what is a brochure / catalogue that I simply gave up.Overall, a must see destination. The layout and sky location is similar to the JW Marriott but for me Hyatt reigns supreme. If budget is not an issue, opt for Grand Deluxe Bund view with 180 degree view of Shanghai. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Spectacular Grande Hyatt One of the most beautiful hotels we've ever stayed in, with service to match.Because of the height (hotel occupies from floor 54 through 85) the views from our room, public rooms, all restaurants and bar, are simply breathtaking. Food at breakfast, and at two of three restaurants, the best we had in the city. Spa was also terrific--I had two Oriental massages, a facial and a manicure. Decor (art deco) stylish but inviting. Unlike many of the other 5 star hotels (which we visited--Ritz, JC Mandarin, Shangri-La, with cavernous lobbies), the Hyatt feels more personal and warmer. Concierge desk competent and charming. The location is not the negative as billed. Shanghai is enormous, and spread out--and not really a walking city like many in Europe. So to go anywhere, you must take a taxi, which is very cheap. It is worth an extra few minutes in a taxi to stay at this first class hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Make sure you know what you are getting into! The experience started of poorly. I personally wrote to the Hotel in Shanghai as suggested by reservations, inquiring about a long-term stay. A 21day stay to be exact. They quoted me a more expensive rate than the most expensive I could find on Hyatt.Almost crooked!Eventually, we change travel plans to stay only 6 nights. We only ended up staying 3 nights! Food in the Italian restaurant was fair. The service was about 2 star level. It is really a business hotel where the are very proficient at moving them &quot;In and out&quot;. They really have not interest in the qaulity of stay. The Business traveler does not have much time to spend complaining about accomadations that their Company is booking and paying. Service was poor from the Front Desk to the Atrium Bar, where we sat for 10 minutes and never were greeted/served. It might be worth a stay for 2 nightsin a &quot;Grand Deluxe Bund View Room&quot;. Free breakfast in Atrium Bar with a free Gold Passport. Sky pool and gym are to be seen. Just understand you will be run over by business people and expect 2 star service. If you can get past that you will enjoy 2 nights.5 star service with better location can be found at the JW Marriot. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Spectalular experience Spectacular experience, what else can be said about this hotel in this great city. Ashtonishing views and architecture make this hotel a once in a lifetime experience. If you are going to Shanghai once in your life, this is the place to stay. The overall service and western food at the Cafe were very good.The only drawback is that it is located in Pudong, the new Shanghai, while most of your activities are in the other side of the river / city and a taxi is needed everytime going out. Anyhow it isn't too far or expensive and its worth it.Also definitely, try to get a room with a view to the Bund and a river view. That is a must. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Deluxe bath with a view Many reviewers mentioned the deluxe bathroom and I must just add a few words on this. Make sure you get a deluxe room with Bund view, order a botle of champagne and strawberries and enjoy the magnificent view from the bathtub. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Unrivalled Views at Hyatt Shanghai Without a doubt this hotel is one of the most memorable I have stayed in recently. Standard rooms are a cut above the rest and the service was impeccible. Not only do the rooms command some of the best views of Shanghai, they are extremely spacious and tastefully decorated as well as good value for money. A wall of windows in the bathroom meant every time I lay back in the bath I had a spectacular view of the city shimmering below.The spa was excellent with a wide variety of treatments and the pool, on floor 57, is the highest in the world. This by no means is an average hotel and I do hope to stay here again.There are numerous restaurants in the hotel ranging from Japanese sushi, traditional Shangainese and even Italian. It's what I would expect of a Hyatt and am surprised to read some disappoiting reviews.I can't really think of any down points other than you can't buy cigars in the Grand Cafe at 3am in the morning after partying the night away in the Bund! As a 29-year-old female non smoker, I didn't really want one that much anyway! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Take away the view and it's distinctly average Before starting this review it's worth putting my post in perspective as Iappreciate it's at odds with some of the other comments on the site.First of all I'm someone who spends every spare penny (and then some) on travel, and have had the privilege of staying in some really excellent hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur and the Chedi in Muscat.In fact staying at the Hyatt Shanghai made me realise just how good they were!Though I'm far from the red faced western tourist who will bellow at the &quot;natives&quot; for not serving his beer cold enough, that does mean my expectations are set fairly highly.Secondly, I was here almost a week and so was perhaps able to road test the hotel more than had I breezed in and out on a corporate expense account.However, once you take away the views from the Hyatt, which the Shanghai guide books rightly rave about, my experience was that this is not a signature five star hotel at the top of its field. Instead, I found it distinctly average.Nothing too major to spoil our break, but some significant chinks nonetheless. To take the good and not so good from various areas of the hotel:* The public areas of the hotel and the rooms are decked out in dull, business colours, which is appropriate as the Hyatt is stuffed full of suits. And the place does seem to be well kitted out for a variety of business meetings, so if you are here on company business and just staying for a night or two it will probably be fine. But, other five star hotels have much more grand and (in the case of the Westin) stylish entrances and areas.* The staff: Lots of them milling about with dark suits and ear pieces. However, here is a case of where more really does not mean more. There were plenty of people around to whisk my plate away at dinner before my wife had finished eating, but on one or two occasions there was a distinct lack of initiative shown for some of the most simple requests.* The grand club: The Hyatt, like a lot of other 5 star hotels, makes a big deal about its club floors. The staff in the club lounge were generally the most helpful in the hotel, but the breakfast served upstairs is unfortunately a pale imitation of what you get (and, true, have to pay for) downstairs in the main restaurants. Also I was surprised that the piece of paper you are given when checking in fails to communicate one of the most useful perks of staying on a club floor - free Internet access in the business centre (usually around USD3 for 15 minutes).Don't think that staying on a higher floor will give you a better view though. On floor 80 upwards you are almost too high. The views are better from reception on floor 54.* The health club: The Hyatt has a small, but fairly well equiped gym. It also has separate men's and women's jacuzzi and sauna areas and a pool. When using the pool,they make you wear a swimming cap. If that's the rule then that's fine...but I expect everyone else to do the same.Bizzarely though on my second day I took a swim and spotted a Chinese man and his two kids in the pool. The kids wore a cap, the man didn't. As a result, I figured I didn't have to either.As I mentioned, the Hyatt has plenty of people lurking about doing nothing in particular, and the pool is no exception. I was promptly asked to put my cap on. When I pointed to the man, I was told my hair was longer. Not true, my hair is generally considered pretty short!On two other occasions, Chinese men didn't bother to wear the cap and weren't questioned. Only one of them had what could be considered to be a 'buzz cut.' The impression I was left with, was that these guys were some kind of big wigs and that asking them to don swimming gear would be a major loss of face by the local staff.* The spa: I had a stone massage at the 'Oasis Spa' near the gym and my wife had Chinese foot massage. Other five star hotels in Shanghai such as the Westin and Marriott have brand name spas attached (in the case of the Westin, a Banyan Tree).The impression I got from the Hyatt is that this was added as an after thought and the practitioners were more like enthusiastic amateurs, not therapists. The guy giving me the stone massage seemed like a masseur (he didn't speak English so I couldn't ask) and tried to be pleasant, but the way he was fumbling around with the rocks didn't inspire confidence. The spa room was also right by reception with the door open, so I could clearly hear people clearing the phlegm from their throats (quite a common sound in China)!* The location: Not great. All the action happens on the other side of the river. There is a road tunnel, but if this is closed or heavily congested your 10 minute trip can become a 45 minute one. I did overhear some guys saying they were building a new bar and entertainment area nearby though.* The view: Yes, the view is great and the building is an architectural landmark. The thing is, there is nothing stopping you coming to have a coffee in the Hyatt. Actually I'd recommend it. But Shanghai really is Sci-Fi city. Anywhere high up seems to have a view.In summary then, if you at the Hyatt for a short trip or have a business meeting nearby, then the hotel is probably the place for you. If you are here for a holiday, I recommend the Westin where we tried out the Banyan Tree Spa. I didn't see the rooms, but it looks a lot nicer inside and less staff milling about managed to be a lot more friendly and helpful! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"The sky is the limit Of course, before posting my review I've read the previous comments. Well, it's really hard to me believe that some people can report a bad experience with this Hotel. I have traveled all my life long, and I've stayed at the best Hotels in the world and, trust me, It's quite impossible to find something like the Shanghai's Grand Hyatt (and I'm not particulary in love with the Hyatt). I had a Diplomatic Suite in one of the Club floors and the room was incredible, at the 79th floor, with glass walls and a view on the city like the one you can have only from an airplane. The room, like the whole hotel, is very, very elegant and confortable. The service is accurate and kind. The restaurants are a bit smokey and busy, but the food is very good. The lobby is some 40-floor high and really impressive. In one word it's a once-in-a-life experience you can't miss! The only spot is about some employees speaking very poor english.P.S.: I have found two taxi lines and the one reserved to the hotel guests had the priority. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Wonderful Experience I read some bad and good reviews of this hotel before we went to Shanghai, but we choose to stay at the Hyatt anyways. It was a lovely experience. We stayed on the 81st floor, Bund view, club room, and that made the experience both wonderful and expensive at the same time. Everyone was very kind, and the club breakfast and happy hour was great. The pool and fitness area had the same lovely views, and the restaurant, Canton, had fabulous dimsum. I would stay at this hotel again.One thing though, the Internet isn't free in the room (and they charge you for each laptop about USD$15 a day), but if you have a notebook, use the club room for free.Also, try the mooncakes! They make a great present to bring someone. They are to die for! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Flying high in Shanghai We stayed for 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in August 2005. The hotel is situated between floors 54 and 88 in the 'Oriental Empire State Building', the Jin Mao Tower. There is no doubt that the building is impressive, even if the area, Pudong, is rather soulless - rather like a rather rubbish 1960's sci-fi film's 'city of the future'.Our room was a Grand King and consisted of bedroom with king bed, tv in cabinet and a desk, and a lovely bathroom with large bath, walk in shower with body jets, modern sink with heated mirror and a separate toilet. The storage area was rather limited with just the one wardrobe and very few drawers. The main attraction of the room is the floor to ceiling window which, from the 80th floor, gave superb views over the Bund (you need to request this or you will be given a Pudong city view which is not as exciting). We spent many an evening wowing at the amazing vision of Shanghai at night lit up with as much neon as possible (and amusingly the room has a sign which says 'Help Shanghai to save electricity'). The room was very clean but the accessories are a bad choice, e.g. a lot of stainless steel in the bathroom suffering from water marks as soon as you used it. The tv had a good number of channels but the air conditioning was not good, we were very warm at night (and I am never warm!)The staff in the hotel were courteous but a little stuffy at times. We had a problem with our credit card (security check even though we had phoned them to tell them we were in China, tut) and felt that it was far more of a hassle to them than it was to us.The club provides a good buffet breakfast (continental only), an afternoon tea and an excellent evening buffet. Hot and cold drinks are available throughout the day and we found this invaluable. The hotel contains a fine range of restaurants and bars and it is not necessary to leave the hotel. Be aware that it is necessary to book. Room service is delicious and we made good use of this. Always remember that a 15% service charge is applied, even if the service is lacking, and they will still leave a space for a tip!My main disappointment with the hotel was also my main delight. We loved the view from the room because of its situation however, as a tourist, it really is not the best place to be if you have come to visit Shanghai. Taxis are easy to get but the traffic is very busy; the Bund tourist tunnel is a lot of fun once, but an expensive option; and we never did manage to find the ferry port... "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Breathtaking Hotel The Grand Hyatt Shanghai is in the breathtaking Jin Mao Tower just wonderful located. I think it is one of the greatest hotel experiences in the world. Rooms in the corner of the building, where there are three glazed walls (even in the bathrooms!), are excellent. The food in the two Chinese restaurants and in the Japanese restaurant is outstanding. On level 87 is a charming bar and on level 53 there is the smart Piano Bar with live entertainment, perfect!BUT service was absolutely dreadful! On the first day they wanted to cancel our Club privileges, then there was some noises in our neighborroom and they didn't manage to stop it (not til we asked them to do so four times!). Another day we wanted to have a nice diner in the Canton restaurant. So we asked them in the afternoon for a specific table in front of the window, where you can overview the city by night. After two confirmations from the concierge (with adumbration), we came at eight o'clock to the restaurant and they gave us a table, which was not by the window, and the restaurant was full!!! And the staff and even the duty manager do not accommodate to you with a little regard. Rooms where not very clean too!The reason why I rate this hotel with four points is, that there isn't a better hotel in the city! We had a look to all of them (Four Seasons, St Regis, Marriot, Ritz Carlton), but they aren't as nice as the Hyatt.In spite of everything it is a beautiful place to stay! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Great hotel in a great city We just returned from a 10 day trip to China. We were in 4 different hotels, but the Grand Hyatt definetly was the highlight of our trip. Our 70th floor room had an amazing view of the BUnd and the Oriental Pearl Tower, which was enormous in the evening. The room was very comfortable and good equipped. THe food was very good,both in the cafe, as well as the other restaurants. The room service was excellent. The bar &quot;Cloud 9&quot; on one of the highest floors had an extremely cosy atmosphere. We would stay here again. It was the nearest thing to heaven. Excellent! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"All Hype -- Disappointed and Not Going Back We were in Shanghai last Sept/Oct during their National Day holiday period. We were on a &quot;hotel-review mission&quot; because we stayed at both Westin and Grand Hyatt, both using points for their respective hotel &quot;frequent traveller&quot; program. What a difference service-wise, granted that we were also upgraded at Westin (to a residence apartment), and we were offered to pay another $100 for a river-view room at Hyatt. Both hotels had two taxi lines set up at the front door. One for hotel guests, and one for non-hotel guests. At Westin, when taxi was not in abundance, hotel guests always had the priority. At Hyatt,we waited in the taxi line where the sign for hotel guests was for 10 minutes, and they ignored us and only tending to people in the non-guest line. We did not get a taxi until I walked back into the lobby and complained.At Hyatt, the bedding consisted no flat sheet, no blanket, but only a comforter with bedcover or duvet cover (to make it sound better).At Westin, heavenly-bed a hype or not, there was the usual set up: flat sheet, covered blanket, then comforter with a duvet cover.At Hyatt, it took them almost an hour to get the crib set up in the room, after I requested at the front desk, called the front desk, called the housekeeping dept, spelling the word &quot;crib&quot; along the process. There is no comparison for the crib itself. It is indeed a heavenly-bed type crib at Westin, and I dreaded mold for the foam used at Hyatt, so my three-year-old ended up sleeping in our bed anyway. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"An Incredibly Poor Excuse for a 5 Star Hotel The Grand Hyatt is without doubt one of the worst alleged five star hotels I have ever stayed in. I was stuck there for five days last week due to a customer staying there and it was one bad experience after another. This from a hotel where I was paying in excess of US$300/night. From a surly arrival &quot;welcome&quot; in the Grand Club, to incredibly poor service in the Canton restaurant at a table with very important guests, to the removal of personal items from my room without permission, to the final straw - a general refusal to give credit for a dinner that made me sick, the hotel gives poor service. With the notable exception of the resident manager, Paul Kwok, every management person I interacted with first wanted to contradict everything I said, then wanted to &quot;investigate&quot; a problem and then wanted to prove me wrong and avoid responsibility. To quote from an email from the general manager -&quot;We have ascertained all the details pertaining to the incidents that you had mentioned earlier, with eye witness report and factual material that are in our favour. &quot; Basically, the customer is wrong and we are right. This attitude is pervasive in all of their dealings with customers. I would never stay in this hotel again and would caution others not to do so. Shanghai is full of great hotels - JW Marriott, Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons, there is no reason to stay in this poor excuse for a hotel. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Good Hotel in a Great CIty Having recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Beijing, which was out of this world, I was very excited about my upcoming trip to the Grand Hyatt in the Jin Mao Tower. However, on arrival I felt that the hotel did not live up to its 5-star rating. For example, I had been looking forward to the pool facility, and was disappointed in that it was much smaller than I had envisioned. Also, I found the lobby lacking in both atmosphere and decor. The best part about our room was the bathroom, which had a large marble jacuzzi tub and a great shower. Otherwise, the room was nondescript. I would not stay there again. "
grand hyatt shanghai ,"Profitable Stay! Visited Shanghai for a few days and to top off our holiday, we checked into the Hyatt on 16th June. Got a bund view room on the 76th Floor ...... magnificent view at night of the bund. Ah! it's treats like this every once in a while that makes it memorable. Fantastic stay on our part and a profitable one for me personally ~ I trade options in my spare time and was trading the few nights we were in Shanghai, on the very night of our stay in the Hyatt I made a trade which gave me a $40K profit. My best ever 1 day trade ..... and for that, Grand Hyatt Shanghai will always be in my lucky hotel list! "
grand hyatt shanghai ,Well......i was expecting more was on the 75th floor - so of course it was a great view. but the rooms were hard to figure out - and seemed a bit musty/moldy. one of the robes hanging was dirty. That made me furious. It's just digusting to think about. the 54th floor is great. fantastic view. not sure i'd stay there again tho.

grand mercure baolong shanghai ,"The WORST hotel I ever stayed in!!! The title says it all but i will elaborate. I travel for a living so I've stayed in all manner and brand of hotels. I stay in hotels about 200 nights per year and having stayed in Mercure hotels and reading the mostly positive reviews here, I booked this hotel for a family vacation. We checked in and were impressed by the grand modern lobby. When we stepped off the elevator on 16 that's where the nightmare began. The carpet was filthy as were the baseboards and doors. This continued as we opened our rooms and were appalled at how dirty they were. The carpet was disgusting, as was the furniture. The beds were just all springs and hard as slabs. They had these disgusting fabric headboards all coated in years of head grease! The furniture was old and worn out and filthy. We didn''t even want to touch anything.The room was very poorly lit which was probably a good thing because if we had more light it would have been even more disgusting but when I turned on one of the lights mounted to the wall, it fell off and shorted out! The bathroom was a health hazard as well with mold all in my shower and dried urine and something like orange soda all over the tile. The sink was cracked in half and looked like someone poured coffee in it and never cleaned it. The other rooms we had were equally appalling! I went to the desk to ask for other rooms and was told they would be happy to move us but all the rooms were the same. Because it was 1 am and we were exhausted, we elected to stay 1 night and we checked out the next morning first thing. I wish I had taken photos to post here to protect future visitors. This hotel must be undergoing a renovation or the photos they posted are simply fraudulent because our rooms looked nothing like them and didn't even have the same decor. BEWARE! "
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,good value for money but far from city center Baoshan is a district North of Shanghai. Not really much to see there. But it's a good choice if you plan on boarding a Yangtze cruise or Ocean cruise the next day. The hotel itself is quite nice. The room (superior) is quite large. The marble in the bathroom adds a nice luxury touch. The light color carpet is an odd choice as you can see some small stains. And unfortunately - like most hotels in China - the bed is quite hard. But they do offer a wide variety of pillows and staff is willing to add extra layers to soften the bed. The breakfast buffet is quite extensive and they do have a selection decent western bread. Swimming pool / fitness center offer a terrace and the lockers are clean. If you're an independent traveler I'd recommend to stay closer to city center. Don't bother to check around the hotel for sight of interest. No other restaurant are worth a visit and there is no shopping center nearby. I got a great deal booking through their internet site. Overall I'd say that it's a good choice if you need to stay in the area. 
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,"Ultra modern 5 star hotel located not too far from downtown We stayed here 2 nights in April 2009 and are happy to say that it deserves its Grand Mercure label and 5 star rating.The rooms were spacious and well decorated. There was a reading lamp and chair together with a separate desk. It had window you could open. The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub. The only drawback was the drain in the shower which was slow to drain.Front desk service was quick and attentive. The breakfast buffet was out of this world - varyig from shrimp to sushi to omelettes. Lots of fresh fruit also. The wine selection was also amazing.The lobby bar is a feast for the eyes. Located off a highway, it is within 20 minutes driving distance from downtown Shanghai.Whatever may have been the situation before, it seems to have been corrected. We would definitely recommend this hotel without hesitation. "
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,"Is it Grand Mercure??? Don't stay here unless you have to I stayed this hotel for four nights. After this stay, I was wondering why this hotel is &quot;Grand Mercure&quot; and not &quot;Ibis.&quot; Just because it has &quot;executive floor&quot; doesn't make this level. The hotel said it is 5-star, but I think it is more like a 3-star. Here's my observation.Location (-1): Very difficult to find, and not in good neighborhoods. Can be reached via Line 3 (Jinwan Town)Ambience (1): I think that the hotel owner is constantly building something. Lobby is nice but the hotel's only restaurant (so to speak) Cafe 180 is too small to serve everybody (although I saw only some Chinese people partying there rather than hotel guest, and its menu are so limited. Also, the hotel has two wings. South wing is more like a traditional hotel for Chinese only. the North wing is newer but the room is more like &quot;ibis&quot; style rather than a 5-star hotel. I think that the hotel owner is also budiling another wing or may conference center but...Room (- 1 or 3 if you stay in executive floor): The hotel basically has three levels of room. One is executive floor room which is nice, the second is room in North wing which is newer and brighter but very small. Don't even have a bath tub and only shower stall. I think that even room in Four Points by Sheraton Pudong is a lot better and roomier than this one. The last one is room in South wing which is old, dirty, and most of all very dark. Also, both room in North and South wing has very weak &quot;air conditioning.&quot; Eventhough I turn the individual controler to 5 degree c, it was still hot. Reminded of old 2 - 3 star hotels for Chinese only.Staff: Trying very hard to speak but just couldn't. When I checked in, I asked I like a renovated room even though I needed to pay extra, and the check-in staff said what is &quot;renovated&quot; mean?? Also, there was a knock on the door for the second night at 7:00, and I had to woke up becaue it was so loud and had to open door. A Chinese woman handed a sheet of paper which said that the swimming pool will be closed from today for renovation. But, there was no mention when this &quot;old&quot; swimming pool will open again. And, why this woman is hammering my door rather than slip the sheet under the door. Just weired. Facility (-3): There is no facilities except some restaurants. No fitness center, no sauna or outdoor swimming pool, no nothing. Business center is small, and staffs do not understand English very well. The only option, which was indoor swimming pool was close for renovation but didn't say when it will reopen again. Strange.Total Score: -4 or -1Verdict: Should avoid unless you have to. "
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,OK We spent 4 nights in this hotel and whilst the lobby etc is very modern our room was very dated and resembled a travelodge if i'm honest. Also we could hear absolutely everything that was said in the corridor and hear doors opening and closing.Breakfast was ok but very limited compared to other mercure's in China - god help you if you want eggs for example !!Overall i would say the hotel is adequate but the main drawback was the distance from the centre/tourist attractions - on average 30 Yuan taxi ride to most places and anywhere between 150-200 Yuan from the airport. 
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,"Good choice Stayed in an executive room on the 21st. Pros: Ginormous bed, PC in room with free internet access, Lots of little perks. Friendly service. Good value for money. Breakfast has a huge selection.Cons: hotel is currently (Nov 06) being remodeled so lobby (and lower floors) may be unbearably loud. Called for room service at midnight - brochure says small selection available all night, but was told it was closed. First day reported for breakfast at 6:30 - food was out but most of it was cold as the heaters underneath hadn't burned turned on.A taxi to Yuyuan gardens set me back 28 yuan and took 30 minutes or so during non-rush hour traffic. It was preferable to taking the metro - the nearest station to the hotel is a 15 minute walk up the roadI would stay here again. "
grand mercure baolong shanghai ,"Great Value Out of city centre but 1st class. Well equipped, clean rooms. Efficient, helpful staff. Laundry service good value.Excellent breakfast. Would recommend. "

grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"A 4-Star Hotel with 2.5-Star Service Location: It is located outside of “inner circle highway” or of downtown area. One has to take a taxi to go anywhere. Although Shanghai Taxi is not expensive, the traffic jam and unavailability of taxi near the hotel often makes a trip to somewhere become a headache (there is Starbuck two blocks away however). Facilities: The hotel is relatively new. The lobby area is small, because most part used as a bar, with bench against a divider for customers to sit (you get the picture). The room is relatively small, but well equipped (the room we had has a washer). No comments on food (We usually don’t eat at hotel restaurant). Service: Here is the problem. We booked it because it’s a 5-star hotel (actually I found later that some travel sites list it as a 4-star) and expected a 5-star service. First, while there are one or two employees at the entrance, none opened the taxi door or helped with our luggage when we arrived (we didn’t need it anyway). When checking-in, we were told the double room we booked was not available and only twin rooms were available. Based on my experiences, almost all US brand hotels will provide next grade room instead; but not this hotel. Both front desk girl and the manager talked in a polite, but business-like, tone (certainly not a 5-star, or any star, hotel business tone) and were firm about the twin room. Their excuse was all double were booked. Based on my observation later, the hotel was not even half full (It was a Saturday). Since we just had a 15-hour flight and didn’t have the energy to go to next level manager or find another hotel; and settled for a twin room. We moved to Hyatt on the Bund next day.In summary, the hotel’s facilities are a 4-star and the service is 2- or 3-star. If one has a business in Hongqiao, it is OK to stay (but there is a Sheraton near-by). Otherwise, there are so many others available with competitive rate, and much better location and serivces. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Basically good It may be a little far from downtown, but still a good place to stay. Rooms are equipped with a washing machine, which came in handy towards the end of my trip where i wanted to get some laundry done before heading home (so you don't have to do a whole pile when you get back). Rooms are clean and comes with all the toiletries and standard accessories any good hotel should have. Service is generally good. Housekeeping is efficient but knowing how to speak mandarin will come in handy when requesting items from them. They greet you in english but can't say anything else in beyond &quot;Hello, Housekeeping&quot;. When at breakfast, do be warned of a certain young chap who is in charge of the eggs section. Very unfriendly to non-caucasians with a nonchalant attitude. Not a great way to start your mornings. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Really great for those traveling in groups Grand Mercure Hotel in Shanghai had everything we wanted! Eight of us went to Shanghai for the weekend to have a little food tour and we wanted to stay together &amp; not be separated into too many rooms. I know not many hotels offer suites for four people, until I came across Grand Mercure. I found out the hotel just opened in 2007, which meant everything’s bound to be fresh and new. My friends and I decided to get two suites, with four people occupying each room. We were given a suite that had generous space and contained two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a dining area &amp; a fully-equipped kitchen that even had a washing machine. One suite was priced at around RMB 4000.00 for three nights already. It was definitely value for our money. A definite plus is the hotel’s Lv Feng Chinese Restaurant. Since we’re on a food tour of Shanghai, we decided to give the hotel’s own restaurant a try. The food was a bit costly compared to other Shanghai food spots but we were aware that we’re in a 5-star hotel’s dining establishment. We ordered dim sum and a variety of other Chinese dishes and they did not disappoint our group. I compliment the chef for using fresh ingredients and avoiding the usual downfall of Chinese food—extreme oiliness. All in all, our dining experience satisfied us and our tummies. I would definitely go back to Grand Mercure Hotel when I return to Shanghai for another vacation. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,Good hotel but far from downtown Decent hotel as I paid around 85.00 a night but taxi ride to downtown is about 7 dollars. Our room had one wall that was peeling wood. Clean bathroom and nice bed. Balcony was not allowed to use. 
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Rooms need an update The lobby is beautiful! Very modern. But the rooms need an update. It seems like all the money went into the lobby &amp; restaurant. The Bed was very hard. It was a shock to sit on the bed. You actually sleep on a piece of wood and a box spring. There is no mattress. The bathroom is fine and the shower is the best part of the room. You can hear people opening and closing doors all night long. Walls are very thin and if you face the street, traffic noise is annoying. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Great Deal I had two nights stay at this hotel, very nice sleep, the bed was fantastic. Staffs' service was good and helpful. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Great place for 2-week stay Stayed here for work trip with a large group of associates. Overall, nice hotel, with very comfortable room and at a great rate (US$80 / night).Location is OK -- kind of a long walk to the closest subway, but close to restaurants and shops. Relatively central to Hongqiao.Had to put up with the usual strange Shanghai occurrences...occasional strange smells wafting through the hotel, the washer/dryers in the room didn't work, and I was called in the room for &quot;massage&quot; more than once.Staff was super-friendly. Food in restaurant was overpriced by Shanghai standards -- 5 min walk would take you to many better options. "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Food a Let Down Service in general is excellent: housekeeping was efficient and friendly except for one room maid who displayed acute annoyance when she failed to understand my request for a tea bag. Concierge was helpful. My room was spacious but although it has a kitchen there is no cookware, crokery or cutlery provided. I find the provision of a washing machine a great asset. I would give them four stars but the food and beverage department needs to lift their game.First, only ONE cup of tea/coffe is provided with the buffet - and the extra charge for an extra cup of tea/coffee is 50% of the cost of the buffet (they explained that it is to discourage people from ordering a coffee and sit there all day; for the same reason they charge for water). The food quality was sub-standard - I was served chicken that was seared on the outsdie and RAW on the inside. The rice congee was lumpy and barely warm (when I complained I was told this is the way they eat it). The service staff was polite but talk to each other over your head across the dining room as if you're not there (admittedly I was the only one there - staying too long, I suppose). "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Recommanded for groups!! Everything we wanted!! Eight of us went to Shanghai for the weekend to watch the F1 Grand Prix and we wanted to stay together &amp; not separated into too many rooms. Not many hotels offer suites for 4 until I came cross to this hotel. As it only opened for few months everything was new. Great size suite, over 1000sq, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room, dining area &amp; a fully equipped kitchen (even with a washing machine). So we took two suits, each suit was around 4000Yuen (3 nights) = US$530. Great value as it works out only 1000Yuen each for the whole stay. At the beginning, my main concern was the location of the hotel. It is not in the heart of Shanghai, around 15mins away by taxi. The hotel is just off the high-way which takes you to central and we didn't experience any traffic while we were there. Although it may sound far but honestly if you stay in a hotel in town, you will spend more time stuck in traffic on the small streets of Shanghai. Cab fare from hotel cost around 40 Yuen. Another pros is that it is close to the race track... great for a grand prix weekend!! Will definitely go back to stay if traveling in a group again!! "
grand mercure hongqiao shanghai ,"Very good experience... I stayed at the Grand Mercure in Shanghai for just 1 night but it was amazing. I only paid $89 for a twin room for me and a friend and its rated as 5 star so that was a good start. When we arrived there was plenty of staff on hand to help us out the taxi and take our luggage. Hotel reception was beutiful with a lovely bar/seating area and bakery. Reception staff were all very friendly as well and spoke good English. On the way up in the lift i found out from the bell boy that the hotel had only opened on July 1st so it was onlyaround 2 weeks old! The room was very nice, it wasnt the biggest room but it was well laid out. We had a flat screen tv, mini bar, microwave, 2 hobs (plus extractor fan) and even a washing machine!! Very unusual for a hotel. The room was basically brand new so that added to the greatnesss of it all. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a luxury stay but doesnt want to break the bank. 5/5 "

hengshan picardie hotel ,"Should be higher up the rankings. Perfect Location This hotel is great. In the french concession area. 5mins from Hengshan road metro station, 10mins on metro to Peoples square. 5 mins the other way to lots of shops and stuff. Beautiful park with black swans across the road. Nice pubs in walking distance. Dont stay near the Bund or city centre...too much building work and dust! This is great, nice big rooms, and HUGE breakfast if you so want. But theres a cafe across teh road which is very popular "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Good Value and Services It's an excellent place for bussiness user, easy to reach location with nice size of room. The internet is fast and no extra charge at all. Complimentary juice and fruits are thoughful and shows extra care. Staff are warm and helpful. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"nice hotel in a good location I have visited Shanghai many times before and this was my stay here. The hotel is an an excellent location. There are two sub-way lines close by - Hengshan Road and another one. There is a huge tree-line park opposite the hotel and and close by is the Xujajai (sic) shopping area. There was a McDonalds and KFC there. In addition Hengshan road has a huge number of bars. There are good dining choices on this road. We had a Brazilian night buffet for some 95 RMB. The in-hotel dining is OK, but by Chinese standards I have been less expensive hotels with far more elaborate choices. The breakfast buffet is a good choice of western and chinese and some Japanese fair. Service in the hotel was excellent but horrendous in the buffet. It is overstaffed and the waiters would go about doing their work mechanically and never made eye contact with customers. You could be waiting endlessly for a coffee refill and no one would notice. I think the hotel definitely needs to work on the training aspect. Waiters and all staff at the hotel were very polite. The internet connection was excellent. Good wi-fi downstairs and wired connection upstairs. They had a tiny business area where they did not have a color printer (weird). A common theme I noticed in China was that carpets are poorly kept. I am yet to see a hotel with clean and spotless carpets. That said I would definitely stay there again. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Can't think of a better hotel in Shanghai This hotel is located in the heart of the French Concession area. From your room window you can see all that Shanghai has to offer: impressive high-rises along side typical Chinese life. It's a short walk to the subway or otherwise a quick cab ride to all the touristy spots in Shanghai. (Added bonus if you don't speak Chinese: the cab drivers all seem to know exactly where the hotel is) Around the corner on Hengshan Lu (5 minute walk) is also a great (and cheap) Chinese restaurant. The room we had was incredibly spacious and comfortable - it was a great place to return to and relax after a day of discovering Shanghai. (We actually had a corner room so more windows = more light and more view) The breakfast at the hotel is amazing, staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I miss it! "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"nice hotel I stayed two weeks at this hotel, and it is in the good location, subway just 5 mins walk and big shopping centers are 10-15 mins walk. The hotel room is really clean and in good condition. Good rain shower in the bath room. The services are really good, people are very polite there.I stayed in the executive level, which having free afternoon tea and internet access. this hotel seems like business travel hotel, but still very nice for the holiday travellers.I will definately come back to this hotel. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Excellent value and quality Stayed here in July 2007 when it was being refurbished and it was noisy. Refurb now complete, new foyer, reception and dining room. Friendly staff who speak good English. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice. Bedrooms well equipped with en-suite, large television, internet access, ironing board etc. Hotel facilities good. Good value or money. Taxis very reasonable, trip to the bund £2.50. Metro station 5 minutes walk. Would recommend to friends and family. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Stay away I am still staying at Hengshan Hotel right now. I spent here the last 5 nights.They are doing a complete renovation right now - but didn't tell me when we made the booking by telephone.Today, Sunday at 6am it was impossible to find some sleep in my room ( 8th (Executive) Floor ) because of the heavy noise caused by the workers. The management refuses any compensation - well, the internet access in the room is free of charge *laughing*Breakfast at executive lounge is fair... and as above already mentioned - leaves much space for improvements.In the services directory they write, that executive lounge is open until 10pm - at 9pm it is already closed.I am deeply disappointed... will not stay here again. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Nice hotel Stayed here on 2 seperate occasions for 3 nights in total during our 2 weeks in China. Both rooms were large and very comfortable with allthe amenities you'd expect from a 4* hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful and stored our bags for 3 days during our trip to the mountains. Were even able to check in early (9am) on our return.Only downside for us was the location. Although the area is good and close to some nice bars and places to eat, in hindsight we'd have booked somewhere a bit closer to the bund as this is where most of the tourist attractions are. Would have meant less travelling on the extreamly packed shanghai metro system.Taxi's are easy to find though and very very cheap so not a huge problem and it was a very nice hotel. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"I enjoyed the Hengshan My company booked this for me, so I have no idea what price I paid.The room was huge, it seemed to be at an intersection of 2 wings, so was an irregular shape, but big.The bed, too was large and good.The outstanding part of this hotel was the air conditioning. I stayed at the hottest and most humid time of the year, and have to say that the air con was the best! Fanstastically cool. I had my breakfast in a strange room, it seems to be all internal, so no windows, just artificial light. As others have said, the food was OK - ish, I have had better breakfasts in Shanghai.Location is what it is. Nice enough area, a park opposite that was good to walk in and watch the early morning exercises and activities, although the humidity soon got the better of me.The main road that the hotel is on has some good shops and local restaurants. I found some great antiques in a junk shop about 500m up the road.Would I stay again:For breakfast, No.If I had the same bedroom again, Yes.If it was very hot and humid: Oh Yes! "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Not 4 Star but Adequate I stayed at this hotel in July 2005 and found it to be very good. However, needing a hotel during a business trip, I discovered the hotel service to have changed significantly. First the good:Cheap price. My rate was 590 RMB (about 65 Euros).Good locationRoom size is large for european standards.Bad:Room was dirty, especially the carpet and bathroomBreakfast buffet was lacking. I got there at 9:00 and it had not been restocked (all the fruit was gone) There were 5 waitresses standing around talking and I had to get my own coffee.The employees don't seem to care about customers, or in providing customer service (untypical of Asia).I will stay somewhere else during my next visit. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Hard Beds but clean rooms The hotel is nice and clean, but the beds are super firm. The breakfast buffet leaves a lot of room for improvement but for the price it is quite reasonable. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"OK for the price Stayed for one night in this hotel. Although Lonely Planet stated that it was located in an historical apartment building it was not so visible anymore. The environment of Hengshan Lu in the French concession is nice, especially if you like western style restaurants, pubs and bars.I got upgraded and the room was good. The furniture shows some wear and tear and the plumbing was not the best.All in all, if you can get a rate around 800 RMB/80 Euro it is good value. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"the pluses outweigh the minuses I stayed at the hotel for a week in Jan 05. When i got there they told me they cancelled my reservation, and were booked but had a small room if i wanted it and could change rooms the next day. first i have to tell you about this room. it's smaller than rooms in europe, absolutely tiny and shaped like a rectangle so it was slightly uncomfortable. luckily i was by myself, i don't think i could have shared it with anyone. if they offer you room 1009, just say no. the bathroom was just funny. it was so narrow that i could really walk straight inside. however, i did get moved the next day to a larger room. the beds are very firm. i like that so i had a wonderful sleep, but if you need a soft bed, this may not be a place for you. the bathrooms used a shower curtain and it may have been me, but i kept getting water all over the ground, plus the water didn't drain as quickly as i would have liked and i thought i saw some places that could have been cleaned better. The location is great. was safe and quiet. i saw the dancing at night and tai chi in the morning. very serene and different from the hustle and bustle of the city. every taxi driver i met knew the hotel and where it was so no problems there. the staff speaks very little if any english though i saw a lot of non-asians at the hotel. i'm not sure how they got their questions answered. if you want to brush up on your chinese, or like learning how to communicate in different languages you would enjoy this. but let me say that the staff is very nice and helpful and went more out of their way then some 4 or 5 star hotels i've stayed at. but the hotel did have these cards with english and chinese translations of major tourist spots and the hotel address. bring that with you and you'll have all the major stuff covered. the one annoying thing was that the maids would come by at 8:30 in the morning which i think is a little too early for cleaning. the hotel is a nice walk to shopping and restaurants. for the price, this was better than i expected in an expensive city. "
hengshan picardie hotel ,"Good value and great location for local flavor We stayed here about a week last spring at the suggestion of a friend who has a company in Shanghai and spends half his time here. He offered 2 places but said we might like this one better because it was in a &quot;quiet&quot; location. We thought we might want to be where the action was, but when we got there we realized what he meant. Shanghai is a frenzy, packed, loud, shoving crowds. Unlike the big chain hotels, the Hengshan is in an older established neighborhood in the best section of town: the French concession. It is a tree-lined street with some of the older French villas nearby. The hotel is in the area where guidebooks have scenic walk itineraries. It is across the street from 2 parks, a large one with public dancing at night, and a small local one. We liked the small park - in the morning you can see oldies doing tai chi or getting their excercise dancing to 1930's music. The hotel is a remake of the old Picardie apartment, so the rooms are enormous with high ceilings and (some) balconies. They have a classic 1930's feel, not artificial but authentic with a well-lived-in feel. Unfortunately, there are no no-smoking rooms so you can't get one that's totally odor-free. The beds and furnishings are of moderate quality. The bathrooms are large, with new marble tiles and fixtures (including separate glass shower stall) but look like they had been designed by an amateur. Clunky. Westerners shouldn't have a problem with the cleanliness or the toiletries. The staff don't speak much English so you can't rely on them for sightseeing help. But they are friendly and trustworthy. You'll feel secure here. We didn't eat there as there are local restaurants with real local Shaghainese food. Due to jet lag, we woke at 5am and would head out to either the steamed dumpling shop or the fried dumpling stand, which open at 6am - each about 2 blocks away in opposite directions from the hotel. For about 50 cents, you can get a holf dozen of the best dumplings in the world. We ate these in copious amounts every morning. There's also one of the biggest internet cafes nearby, with about 120 computers. You get a fast connection to your email for about 50 cents an hour. About 2 blocks away is a subway stop, and there begins the posher restaurants. A few blocks away is a major shopping district with huge department stores. With taxis cheap and the subway nearby, it's easy to get to the major tourist sites, yet be able to retire to your &quot;neighborhood&quot; at the end of the day. In summary, this hotel isn't for those who are looking for a U.S.-type glass and steel hotel. It's for those who want something cheaper and more in tune with the culture and history of the city, and who are indpendent (i.e., not dependent on hotel staff for arrangements). "

hengshan picardie hotel ,na ja 
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"We were pleasantly surprised how nice the hotel was! My friend and I stayed at Hengsheng Peninsula International Hotel for three nights in October 2009. We booked this hotel because it looked ok from the photos and the price was affordable. We weren’t actually expecting much, we just wanted a decent base for sightseeing in Shanghai. We were pleasantly surprised how nice the hotel was! Everything went smoothly and we really enjoyed our stay. We had a nice room: spacious, clean, high floor, with comfy beds. The breakfast was also good; with a lot of options to choose from (although a lot of Chinese style food). There is even a cook making fresh omelets. There is a rooftop bar, with unbelievable views over the city. Also the prices there are quite unbelievable, but the view is definitely worth it! We even think that the location of the hotel is ok. We went around the city by taxi, bus and walking. I will definitely book this hotel also for my next visit. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Nice Hotel with great view but not for much longer!! This is a decent hotel within walking distance of Shanghai's main shopping district Nanjing Road. We stayed on the 21st floor and had a great view of the Bund and Shanghai's skyline. This wont be for much longer though as they are building a massive hotel complex opposite that will totally block the view. If you are a single guy staying here you will be offered a &quot;massage&quot; every night you get in the elevators, i was with the girlfriend and she managed to scare them off with her death stare! The hotel bar on the top floor is cool for a couple of drinks at night. There is probably better hotels better situated than this one with not so much walking involved but for the views on offer here it is good value. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Serviced Apartments same same but no free anything Surprise...there is a budget option, about 320kwai a night double ensuite apartment, contact Frank! I booked through Hostels.net and got an almost clean room, good; fridge, washing machine, dryer microwave n stuff, shower head was missing, no bottled water, but new tooth brushes... what can i say, Shanghai is still a building site, sauna and massage on 2nd floor-well promoted, and boz outside offering lots of girls. Good breakfast cost 83kwai didn't try lunch or dinner!The closest Bridge was being rebuilt so problem walking across creek to Bund, but soon will be complete. hotels charge for internet, but Frank doesn't. If you want luxury it ain't here, infact your hotel should be less than 5 years old for luxury, the swimming pool cost 35kwai and you are expected to buy a hat, yes for swimming! As mentioned before, if you get a good price then it's a good hotel but if you pay 500kwai or more (some pay 1000+) then "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Try a different hotel unless you get a good deal... I felt this hotel was much too expensive for what we got. We paid about $110CAD per night. There are many other hotels to choose from that are just as nice but cost less.The room was very tiny, but clean and nicely decorated. My personal favourite was the bathroom: the one wall was glass, allowing you to sit in the tub yet admire the sights out the main window. The maids were very sweet and polite and the bellhops always flagged a taxi for us and told the driver where we wanted to go. There is a pool, which we didn't use, but when we went to look at it, the pool staff were not very friendly. Also, there seemed to be a &quot;massage&quot; service offered. In the evenings, a very pretty woman in a hotel uniform hung around the elevators advertising this &quot;in room massage.&quot; Our room happened to be next to a hotel guest that accepted the massage (we saw the masseuse), and it was rather *ahem* loud!!The front desk staff all spoke English. However, they overcharged us for food from the restaurant, even though we were adamant we didn't have it. We had a flight to catch, and having to pay this extra money left a poor final impression.The bar on the top of the hotel has fabulous views, attentive waitstaff, and high prices. I would recommend going anyways for the view. The cafe on the main floor made really good soup, but terrible sandwiches (even by &quot;Chinglish&quot; standards).The location is quite good: close to the Bund, but you do need to cross a bridge to get to it. We could not find the foot bridge and didn't want to risk crossing the car bridge (we only saw one couple attempt) and so always took a taxi (it's about a 3 minute ride to the Bund). "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Nice hotel that offers value We found a great rate online for $33 and thought it to be a great value for our money. The hotel had a nice lobby and friendly staff that mostly spoke English. It depends on where you want to stay, but after a few days I found the location to be a bit far from the sites I liked to visit. However, it is a 5-10 minute walk to the Bund. The rooms were plenty clean and nice. Bottled water was replenished everyday. The morning breakfast was very sub par and do not highly recommend it, unless you want an easy meal with Western style food. There is a cool bar on the 26th floor, with a Captains Bridge Ship theme (not sure why), but it provided great views of Pudong and the city, though the drinks were very expensive.Overall I enjoyed this Hotel and would recommend it if you found a good deal online as we did. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Pollution Smell Inside and out Shanghai was the smoggiest, most polluted city I have ever been in - and I have been to most cities in asiaWith this in mind, you want to stay in a hotel which is clean without a dusty feel in your room.We checked into this hotel after booking on wotif.com as a mystery deal (which said it was 4 stars which I think is false advertising), The lobby was quite nice, but the lady at the reception was very rude (but had ok english). We were given the tiniest room which was dustier than it was outside and smelt terrible like a mix of chemical, pollution and cigarettes. I felt like there were knives in the back of my throat. Because I have asthma, this can be dangerous. I was hoping not all rooms were not as dusty as this.we compained to reception about this, and they showed us about 4 different rooms which were all equally as dusty, dirty and smelly.We finally complained to the manager - Her name was fanny, At first she was lovely and tried to upgrade us to a suite, showed us about 6 more different rooms and reassured us she wanted us to stay at her hotel. After all 6 other rooms were equally as dusty, i told her i could not stay there as it would affect my health. I asked if I could have a refund (it was prepaid) and she said &quot;No, because wotif has not paid us&quot; I asked to use the business centre to find a new hotel, and she kindly let me without charge. She told me i had to deal with wotif myself if I wanted a refund. This was a lie as wotif had stated that this hotel itself refused refunds, so she obviously just did not want to refund me. I rang wotif (in australia) and made a complaint, they wanted to know her name, she suddenly got very defensive and turned into an absolute cow. She basically yelled at me asking what for? I made her talk to them on the phone and she was very angry, and was a complete [--] to me after this. The lady on wotif was very kind and refunded my money, but I was charged a wopping 50RMB for the 2 minute call to australia. At least we were out of there straight after (even though this ordeal took at least 2 hours) with our money backI am not impressed with Fanny refusing to refund us, and making up a lie that it was wotif that wouldnt let us, she also told me noone had complained about the hotel before which i find hard to believe after reading the reviews here. I would never stay here and would warn anyone off it. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Roach Motel Literally! Even if you desperately need a room in Shanghai, you should consider staying in a cardboard box under the bridge before you book a room in this dump. I just checked in several hours ago and have already seen TONS OF COCKROACHES running across the floor here. Another one is scurrying by as I type. This is no exaggeration, people. As if that weren't enough -- and believe me, it is! -- this hotel is NOT travel-friendly for Westerners. The assistant manager, Selena, speaks English well, but most others don't speak it at all. Good luck trying to translate &quot;exterminator&quot; if you're lacking basic Mandarin. Do yourself a favor and do not consider staying here under any circumstances ever! Off to find another room on the Internet so I can get the heck outta here . . . "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Comfortable bed nice room I was happy with my stay here at Hengsheng. For only $50 room only per night, I had a very nice room. The bath/shower room was partly separated from my bedroom by a wall of curved glass which was pretty neat feature. The bed was so very comfortable, best I have ever slept in while on my travels. I am not one who lounges about an hotel too much and regarding location, this hotel is situated a little bit out of the way. One must cross over the little creek to reach its north side location. Location is very backstreet sort of Shanghai and not exactly upmarket !I never bothered with breakfast and just strolled across to Starbucks coffee shop each morning.I did not struggle in this hotel as much as i did in ther other China hotels, English was not a problem.I would return to this hotel. Some road works taking place at present on Wusong road, and maybe it could be more easily reached when this is completed ?The oriental TV tower can sort of be seen, depends on your viewing point.I was fairly and comparably pleased with the deal I received from Hengsheng. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"such a dissappointment! Don't stay in this hotel! The location was very bed, in a doggy , smelly area of Shanghai. The room size and bathroom was OK. The worst thing is - there are cockroaches everywhere! I saw at least 5 of them in my room, plus found 2 in my suitcase when I returned to Melbourne! "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"It is international. CTS booked me here. The location is not central. The walk to the Bund is circuitous because of bridge construction. I took cabs everywhere and it was annoying to add the 5-10 minutes to each trip.I have no idea how my prepaid room compared to other rooms. It was large with a big bed and a separate sitting room. The bathroom was fine, clean with excellent plumbing. The AC worked, sort of, but not up to international standards. The hotel supplied a floor fan which was essential. I heard that the _14 rank of rooms were cooler.There was no minifridge, not good; the safe made me feel more comfortable. Good storage space, closet and drawers.I found the staff to be most helpful with varying degrees of English. When they understood what you wanted they were quite accommodating. The uniformed bellhops, one always at a &quot;concierge desk&quot;, were particularly friendly. They helped get cabs quickly.Do check about the procedure for cashing travellers checks.The always good breakfast was the usual array of international foods. Loading up in the AM meant there was no need for lunch.The outside elevator to the roof led to impressive views of the Bund. There's an overpriced menu for snacks and drinks. This begins at 5 PM.The 2 streets running south alongside the hotel had convenience stores as well as more locally focused shops. I needed a lidded tea container, a bungee cord and the strong plaid fabric bag ubiquitous in China. This was great for photography also as long as you made a polite pantomime request. People were generally very friendly.There was usually someone with the &quot;watch? watch?&quot; line outside the hotel and at night &quot;ladybah?ladybah.&quot;I heard that the locker room for the pool was appalling.As has been written, the carpets were noticeably soiled. My room also had a few bugs that disappeared when the lights were on.I frequently used the automatic water boiler for tea, especially if you've used up the complimentary 2 water bottles.The visitors to the hotel were an international mix on tours. Chinese people arriving often had rather large cars.So, a mixed bag. I wouldn't stay here again if I had a choice. However for a mild adventure, I have to say I was satisfied. Chinese cities are so sprawling that I could have paid much more for a much less desirable location. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Pretty Good The hotel has a good location. A ten minute walk puts you on the Bund--once you get oriented and figure out the route. The immediate neighborhood has a local feel to it and is just enough removed to offer a different perspective. I found a small restaurant behind the hotel called King Dim Sum that was a real winner. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. Given the cost, it was an exceptional value. If you go to the 26th floor there is an outside deck that provides spectacular views of the city--an added bonus. The English skills were pretty basic among some of the staff but that was true in many places. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"not bad for your money Was there for 4 days in may 2008That was my second time in this hotelFirst time I was in standard rooms which were SO SO Took deluxe room this time including internet . Was lot better than first time, room more spacious with couch and extra place for working deskStaff more or less welcomingLocation is very interresting( 10 minutes walking from BUND)For 100$ US a night , I think I got what I paid for Mike from Montreal "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Attention take care what room you`ll book! We booked 2 nights in a standard room at Hengsheng (via &quot;rates to go&quot;). We weren`t told that standard room means dump! As we came into the room we were completly disappointed. It was dark, raunchy, hackneyed and completly uncourtious! In front of the window were concrete pillars so that you couldnt see anything. We changed into another standard room that was better but as you can see with our photos still a catastrophy: The bathroom was full with mold! The ancient shower was so small-sized that you touch the nasty rottenness during showering. The kitchenet, espacially the fridge was also dirty, grubby and really disgusting! Not to be about to use it!We asked for changing into a superior room which was also low standard. The staff was nearly always very rude and unhelpful: E.g.: once I was running on a treadmill in the gym a rude charwomen came in an shouted and screamed at me in Chinese. She treated me like a criminal! She did not stop accosting me till a English speaking women came and asked me if I am a hotel guest. Absurd!On the top floor you can find a bar, from where you have a georgeous view at the Bund. It could be reached by a vitreous elevatour. Anyway we don`t recommend this hotel! "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Not that great Location: About a 15-minute quick walk to the Bund or Nanjing Road. Similar walk time, if not a bit longer to the nearest subway station. Located two blocks from a not so nice 'massage' district. Lots of beggars on this street as well if it's apparent that you're foreign. It's about a 45 minute taxi ride from Hongqiao Airport and closer to an hour to Pudong (assuming no traffic for the latter).You will definitely experience the 'real' Shanghai at this hotel since it's not in a major tourist area- you can walk in any direction to see what life is really like for the majority of locals.Accomodation: Not that impressed with this hotel even though it's only about 5 years old. The room carpet was disgusting- it was never vacuumed while we were there (4 nights) and I doubt it's ever been cleaned. The room was a good size, we had a 'double' bed which was two beds pushed together. There's an in-room safe and a small refrigerator. There was also daily bottles of water which was nice, and lots of toiletries if you need them. You have to pay for internet here (I think it was 50 RMB/day), and there is also a fitness centre with slightly crazy hours of 11 am - 11 pm. We had a mixture of experiences with the level of English skill at the concierge and check in desk. They were helpful, though, in writing our destinations in Chinese if we did take a cab anywhere.Overall: We got what we paid for with this hotel in Shanghai, but I would not recommend or return to it. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Was not centrally located I was a bit disappointed when I had read reviews online that said the hotel is centrally located. Centrally located to me means being able to walk outside and within 5 minutes be in the center of a shopping area, metro stop, or restaurants. Hengsheng was not near everything except a Starbucks across the street. Even walking to the Bund took a good 20 minutes as you can't walk over the main bridge but have to go out of the way to get to a side bridge and then circumnavigate your way back to the river. This is only a good place to stay if you want to take cabs everywhere. But even the cab drivers get upset if you want to go short distances (like to Nanjing Road East shopping area). It's not a long walk (20 minutes) but if you're in a hurry or not in the mood to walk, you have to deal with a grumpy cab driver. The room was nice but small and the carpet was subpar considering they call themselves a 4 star hotel. The staff were friendly enough but for a 4 star hotel you would expect them to have some sort of travel service in their hotel to help book train tickets (a nightmare process in China if you don't know Chinese) or airline tickets. Instead they told us that we had to go to a different hotel down the street. They also charge $7 a day for internet usage which is fine except the internet is slow. We changed hotels after 2 nights and ended up at the East Asia hotel on Nanjing Road East. Although it's only a 2 star hotel, the carpet was cleaner and the furniture a little simpler but the staff helped us book train tickets and the location was very central and only a 5 minute walk from the metro and 15 minutes to the Shanghai Museum. Plus the internet was free. Slow, but free. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Hotel is just okay Hotel staff spoke limited English, some spoke no English. I reserved a Suite for 3 people that included internet through Travelocity. When we checked in they gave us a standard room that overlooked the Bund on the 14th floor. I went back to the front desk and was told the room they gave us was a suite. Communication was difficult because the two persons at the check in spoke limited English. I finally spoke to as Asst. Manager who went to the 14th floor with me. She looked at the room and told me it was an &quot;upgrade&quot; because of the view. I asked her for the suite I had paid for and she moved us far, far away to a remote corner. The room we got needed renovation, the living room area had only 2 chairs and a TV that worked intermittently. The room had 2 very small bathrooms. The carpets were very dirty and there were holes in the walls from pictures being taken town. It looked like the room was in the middle of renovation. We were told it was our only option. The breakfast restaurant was very dirty. They sat us at dirty tables every morning and it was difficult to impossible to get a cup of coffee. The food was horrible at best. The concierge staff steered us in wrong directions on 2 occasions. I hope they deliberately didn't do it, it just seemed odd it happened 2 times! They had a nice lounge in the lobby area for morning coffee and late nite drinks and a 26th floor lounge that was nice for a drink late at night. The on premise massage people were horrible! Very poorly trained and the rooms were dirty. It's about 20 minute walk to the Bund, better to take a taxi. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"A nice stay I spent 5 nights at the hotel in Dec-Jan 2007-2008. I had some doubts about it after reading the reviews here before leaving for China... Here's my thoughts about the stay.Location:Ok. Longer than 100 metres to the Bund though (despite what the hotel says), we soon got tired of walking to and from the centre. The helpful doormen got us taxis almost every day, it's so cheap! Y11 (€1,1)) for a cab to People's Square.And across the street there is a Starbucks! :)Cleanliness:When me and my friends booked our rooms there were only Deluxe-rooms left. It wasn't much more expensive and i'm so GLAD we ended up in those rooms. Clean, good beds - but the carpet in both rooms was gross, no walking barefoot and almost not in socks either... Luckily the hotel provided slippers.Clean bathrooms! And hot water all the time.Staff:Friendly overall... but not everyone were what we would consider service-minded.Warning:You'll have to pay Y500 as a deposition upon arrival. We complained, because we thougt it was way too much and got some really unpleasant replies. Anyway, be prepared. A friend who stayed in another hotel paid Y200. Food:Don't spend money on their breakfast. Y80. Too expensive. We came to breakfast around 9.30 and people were still coming in after us. The trays were empty and the huge amount of workers didn't manage to fill them. What they had wasn't that good. Grab a cab and go somewhere else to eat, as we did after that first day. The restaurant is also overpriced. TV:Yes, CNN Asia and HBO. I know what you're thinking: Why go to China to watch TV?? But after 10 hours of walking it feels nice to watch some bad movie and relax in the comfortable bed!Would I stay there again:Sure, I wouldn't mind it at all! But for my own convenience maybe I would choose something that's closer to Nanjing Rd and the metro.Ajust the heating before going out in the evening in winter, otherwise the room will be freezing cold when you get back in.Have a nice time in Shanghai, I love the city! "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Delighted Close to HongQiao airport.No problems getting a non-smoking room.All staff spoke at least a little English and were helpful.Room was clean, newish, and i loved soaking in the bath while watching t.v after a long day's sightseeing.Room stayed nice and warm - important in winter.Softest bed i've had while in Asia!!Some construction on tall building next door but nothing that i found too disturbing.A very short walk to main sights (Bund, tunnel to Pudong, shopping streets etc), restaurants/bars.Great local eatery across the road, where they make excellent xiaolongbao (shanghai dumplings) and soup noodles - very friendly people and delicious, cheap food.Don't bother paying extra for breakfast at the hotel- very average. There's a Starbucks across the road to get you started until you find a better place for breakfast.Overall, a wonderful 4 nights at HengSheng Peninsula International. I will stay there again. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"A Good Value My parents checked in an hour ahead of me, but within 3 minutes of my arrival at the front desk, they knew exactly what I needed and had my key ready. Booked two twins on the 23rd floor. It was a large, corner room with decent carpet, modestly sized bathroom, and all very clean. Had an issue with the hot water taking a while, but I've always taken my time drawing a bath or shower. The beds are nice and firm. The internet connection in my room was unavailable, which was a slight disappointment.Elevators are also a little slow getting up and down, if that sort of thing bothers you. Had a drink at the bar at the top, and everything is incredibly overpriced and unimaginative. Did not get to use the gym or pool.Breakfast buffet was not included, about 90RMB/person, and completely forgettable. There is a place with Shanghainese soup dumplings that rival any place about two blocks away for a tenth the price. You might be better served with that or street food.Overall, I liked this hotel very much, thought it was a great value. Just stay away from the bar and food here. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,Nice Hotel in Convenient Location This was a nice hotel in a convenient location. The buffet breakfast was a little expensive but they had a nice selection of food and start serving at 6:30 AM. The hotel staff was nice and helpful. This is an older hotel but the room was comfortable and they had HBO and a few other channels that were broadcast in English. This hotel also had very hot water in the bathroom. The hotel is located on a main road so getting a taxi is very easy. They also have a small gym and a nice size swimming pool. Their rates are reasonable considering what they have to offer. 
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Ideal Location to Experience Shanghai Last April we met a chap in Cuba who travelled the world on business. His favourite city was Shanghai. We were intrigued as it's about the same flying time from Vancouver to Shanghai as it is to Europe. Fortunately, our local T&amp;T Asian Supermarket has an in-house Silkway Travel Office. Over the summer its manager (Nat) created an ideal Shanghai package for two curious seniors. He recommended the HengSheng Peninsula Hotel as being appropriate for our plans. Nat arranged tours every second day leaving us with alternate &quot;Free&quot; days. Tours included an intro day in Shanghai with lunch and dinner. Others were day tours to Suzhou and Hanzhou. Our Guider met us at Pudong airport with a driver for the one hour trip to the Hotel. The lighting on the skyscrapers as you approach the downtown is a visual feast. We arrived about 10 pm, and were quickly checked in. Our Shanghai Guider ensured that everything went like clockwork for our whole visit. She finally signed off on us as we approached the airport on departure a week later.Our suite was large and well appointed. Right below us was an &quot;old&quot; Shanghai street with store front and side walk vendors. At noon tables appeared on half the street providing instant restaurants for construction workers. The area surrounding the hotel will likely be all high-rises within the next year. The variety of architectural styles Shanghai is mind boggling. There must be 20,000 high rises with another couple of thousand under construction. My wife spent hours watching the street scene below us. Even though construction goes on 24/7, the noise levels weren't that bad. There were not sirens all night like we experienced in London. The breakfast included in our package offered varying tasty Western or Chinese choices. Our fellow guests made breakfast a mini-United Nations experience. After checking in we went up to the roof top lounge for drinks. They were quite expensive, and somewhat short on the Whiskey. They were the last drinks we had in the hotel. Although there are several restaurants in the hotel, we enjoyed sampling the numerous restaurants within a five minute walk from the hotel. We were happy when we discovered a Cantonese Restaurant about a block from the hotel that offered the only Dim Sum we encountered on our whole trip. In Vancouver every second Chinese Restaurant has Dim Sum. We never did use the indoor swimming pool as it seemed like part of a separate Spa complex. The hotel has an ATM which was handy. Credit Card fraud is rampant in Shanghai. We had been warned that our bank would cancel our cards after the first Shanghai charge unless we gave them the specific dates of our visit. As a further protection we used cash for most transactions. The hotel was very convenient for pick-up on our Tour days. On our &quot;Free&quot; days the Bund (sight-seeing) and Nanjing Road (shopping) were within easy walking distance. Pearl Tower and the newly built Pudong business area were just a short ferry ride across the River. We took a very interesting 3 hour cruise from the Bund to the mouth of the Yangze River. Street vendors were persistent around the hotel and the Bund. You just have to get used to ignoring them. We ignored one so much that he finally sold us three Rolex knock-offs for 100 yuan ($13) rather than see us close the car door on him. He had started out at 300 yuan for one. We were a bit apprehensive about our first trip to Asia. Would the two hour stopover in Tokyo be sufficient time to make our connection to Shanghai? Our concerns were based on experiences in London and Toronto. We needn't have worried. Japan Air Lines was the best we've ever flown with. Silkway Travel's Guiders and Drivers were wonderful. We specially enjoyed the kindness and care provided by our young Suzhou Guider. We hope we tipped them enough for all their efforts on our behalf. We relied on Trip Advisor Reviews to obtain the flavour of the HengSheng Peninsula Hotel before making our final decision. All of our expectations were certainly met or exceeded. We definately look forward to returning! "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Needs work First the good things about it:1. Prompt service when dealing with a booking change.Had to make a change in my booking and did so by fax from home, in English. I got a prompt response from them in English, and by fax, which they bothered to send interationally. This kind of customer service is far better than what I am accustomed to in the U.S. Polite and efficient.2. Room was alright. The windows needed cleaning; the carpet could have been cleaned better. Could have been more closet space. The water (as in all of Shanghai) smelled of dirt and was a yellowish color. 3. Nice AtmosphereHotel lobby had a nice atmosphere, though could have offered more seating for visitors who are waiting, as one often does at hotels.Not so good points1. English ability of front desk staff hit and missa. I simply asked for a towel. The staff person said that would be $100 (or equivalent to). She insisted she was right, and this conversation went on for a few minutes until she realized that I was asking only for a towel. Apparently, she thought I was asking for an extra cot or something of that nature.b. Asked for confirmation of my bill. After having been there a couple of days, to avoid any last minute problems, I went to the front desk and asked to make sure I had no extraneous charges, like phone, on my bill, since I didn't use the phone. Again, the clerk misunderstood me, told me I had rung up some exhorbitant amount and she insisted that it must be paid. After I stated I had not used the phone, the wet bar, etc., she went to print out the bill. Whallah, she was quoting another guest's room, not mine.What is really annoying is that the clerk insists that she is right, and involves the guest into a drawn out debate, rather than just listening to the guest, and checking, God forbid, that *she* might have been the one in error.Restaurant - Breakfast buffetAwful and overpriced - avoid it if you are expecting a quality Western style buffet breakfast. This is a faux Western breakfast and borders on disgusting, especially for the price.Refusal to give out key cards to each guest (per room). I was alright with this, but I witnessed another guest deal with asking for a separate room key card for both he and his wife. I can understand the rule, but the staff do not know how to deal with these issues in a polite manner, as a 3 or 4 star hotel ought.This is certainly no 4 star hotel by any means.Location - not good. Nothing around it. No Starbucks, nothing that a Westerner who is unfamiliar with China could patronize.Solicitors/Beggars in the area. I was followed by a male and harrassed by him as I was leaving the hotel for a day trip, making my way down the street on foot. He followed me for several blocks until I finally reached my destination, which was another hotel. The solicitors (by that I mean, asking for money or to buy some article of goods), congregate in front of the hotel.Overall, I'd avoid this hotel. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Overpriced with poor service Small room - beds hard and short - typical in China. Comforatble with everything we need. Complimentary water was supplied daily. Business centre not open till after 08:00. No Services book - had to find out where the restuarants and facilities were, but the English is very limited. Food at the ground floor over priced, people were smoking next to us. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Supposed to be 4star more like a 2star We arrived late in the evening and was allocated a room that seemed a little worse for wear. It was so late that we decided to accept it and try to have a restful night.The room was basic and the carpet looked as if it hadn't been washed in ages and there was a definate tobacco smell in the halls, even though we had a no smoking room on a no smoking floor.We went to the hotel restaurant to have a meal and although the food was ok, the restaurant looked and smelled of damp.We tried to cash our travellers cheques at this hotel, but we were told that they did not have enough money to cash them, and we had to wait till the following day until they could do anything. This seemed quite amazing from a hotel that was supposed to be 4star.I also found the Assistant Manager to be off handed when I complained about the lack of funds to cash my cheques.Generally it was an OK hotel. but I would not stay here again, it was definately a 2 star with delusions of a 4. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Terrible..! I stayed here with my wife and her work colleagues, and by far this is the worst hotel experience in my life. This is how it started.Day 1: I arrived with a group of 29, and the bell boys refused to unload the luggage from the bus or even take it up to my room, so we had to lug it ourselves to our room after an hour for check in. The room was not clean, the bed was not made and it was like a hole! So my wife went down to the reception and we were told that if we want a better room, we must pay more, which we did. The hotel refused to take credit card, they only wanted cash, which we had to hand over upfront. We then found out that we paid more money to get the room we had already paid for! (the other members in the group got the same room as my new room!) Upon asing for a refund, I was told &quot;no refund&quot; and i argued and argued but to no avail.The room that was then given to us, was good, till the time i discovered that it had a leakage issue and that entire carpet near the bathroom was wet! so we called the assistant manager who then came up, had a look and then decided to move us to another room. He apologized for the room and moved us to another simlar room. i ordered some food, and it was served to me in paper plates and plastic cups!!! so i though i would go out for dinner. After returning form dinner, hoping for a good nights sleep, i was woken up by the heat at 4 am, and upon inquiring, i was told that other members in the hotel are feeling cold, so they have turned off the airconditioning! i was amazed at this answer as all roooms have individual a/c units!!! After a lot of shouting, they finally turned on the a/c.Day 2: After a really poor breakfast we decided to go out for shopping and so wanted to exchange money, and i headed to the reception cashier to exchange money and was told that the hotel does not have any money to exchange US$ and that i must go to a bank! The Hotel looks ok, but i felt cheated by the this Hotel and would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.Amit Kabra "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Shady shady shady The hotel never gave me back my room deposit although they told me it would be credited back to my account within 30 days. Now that I'm back home, I figure I'll never get that money back. Hotel itself was decent but seriously, avoid this and get your money back right away. What a shady place. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Great Experience and Great Location! I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but the hotel seemed to be the best value for me, so I went ahead and booked it. I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel!The room was a bit small and oddly shaped, (I got a room with a single bed), but certainly large enough for one person and about what I expected for a value room in a metropolis. The furnishings were all very modern and clean. The bed was actually quite soft and the pillows were luxurious. There's a small desk/workspace, and a small cabinet/minibar with a TV that actually has channels other than CCTV! The bathroom was also very clean and had a clear window with a view of the rest of the room (of course there's a curtain for privacy). The shower was quite hot and had great water pressure (which I guess is to be expected in a hotel, but it was quite a treat for me as I had been staying in hostels for 3 weeks prior). The western toilet was also great. As for the location of the hotel, I have to disagree with some of the other reviews. I think the location is great! The 'dark alleys' mentioned in other reviews were just small side streets like you'd find in any urban area. They weren't brightly lit up, but I didn't feel threatened at any time, even late at night. But the location is great because It's a VERY short walk to the Bund! You go straight out the side entrance of the hotel, follow the street forward a few blocks, turn left a block and you're at the bridge that crosses to the Bund. It's a 10 minute walk to the beginning of the Bund and from there it's not far to the nearest metro station (Middle Henan), so several of the major attractions are nearby or easy to get to.The one above complaint that is true about the hotel is that if your taxi driver tries to go to the main entrance, he'll need to make a U-Turn and come back, which can be tough. However, I had taxi drivers simply turn into the side entrance, which is much more accessible. I didn't have any driver refuse to take me there.The breakfast buffet is similar to every Chinese/Western breakfast buffet around- nothing spectacular, but decent enough.The one odd thing was I put up the DND sign because I didn't feel my room needed to be made up, but when I came back, I found that it had been made up and the sign back on the inside of the door. It didn't really bother me since I had nothing of value in the room, but found it curious. There's an easy to use room safe as well, just in case. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Very pleasant stay From the moment we arrived at the hotel, service was always prompt and courteous. The room was spacious, very clean and modern. We also had the best chinese meals at the hotel restaurant, again with very good service. Definitely wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again if I am visiting Shanghai again as it is such good value for the rate we paid. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Pretty Good Hotel This was the first hotel we stayed in in China, and it wasn't a bad start. The rooms were clean enough, although the carpet was a bit dirty - something we later discovered was pretty standard in China. The hallways had a bit of an unusual smell about them, but the rooms themselves were fine.Our room was small, but from the plan it looked like one of the smallest rooms on the floor. It had a bath along with shower, but the soap/shampoo/conditioner were one and the same - never a good thing for the hair.The gym staff spoke zero English, and the gym itself was pretty basic. The pool looked OK, but apparently you werent allowed to swim in it unless you brought (or purchased) a swimming cap.Before coming I'd read a bit about the location of the hotel and was a little concerned, but it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Admittedly, it isn't a *direct* walk to the Bund/Nanjing, but once you know how to get there its actually reasonably easy. The Bund is about a 10-15 minute walk, Nanjing about 20-30 minutes. The area isn't that well lit but at no time did we feel unsafe, even walking back at around 11pm. Probably the most annoying thing about the location of the hotel was the lack of a nearby metro station. We were reasonably happy here however if we visit Shanghai again, we'll probably look at something a bit closer to Nanjing Rd, just for convenience sake. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Worst service ever When making my reservation i asked what the latest checkout was they can give me as my plane leaves at 23.55pm. I was told if i would checkout out before 6pm, i would not be charged (even confirmed this by asking again). The next day i checked out at 3.45pm and i was charged half day. Upon asking why, they said late checkout is only until 2 pm. After making many objections as they were the ones who told me i could check out at 6pm, they did nothing to help me. Even asked: do you have written proof that you were given checkout until 6pm? (answer naturally is no) No? Then you just have to pay the bill. After that, got ganged up on by 3 receptionists with very unfriendly, almost hostile attitudes.The rooms itself are not that bad. The location however is not good. Its about 15 minutes walk to the Bund and Nanjing Rd without any directions. Walking therefore is not an option. The only way is taxi, but i myself had a hard time to find a taxi to go back to the hotel. Asked about 6 taxis before finding one willing to take me.I will rate this hotel as okay, but only due to the ok rooms. For the rest, the hotel was a terrible experience. Would not advice anyone to stay at this hotel. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Not good area/service Upon arrival we were told they didnt have a double, as ordered but only a twin. After requesting our money back they manager eventually 'upgraded' us to our original choice. No apology was offered. Early check in wasn't possible so we ate some horrendous food in the hotel bar with an awful piano which plays itself and tunes which repeat and repeat. Not recommended. The room was nice and the view was fantastic (thanks to our upgrade), the instructions for using the internet were not clear and this caused problems. Staff spoke enough, but not fantastic English, but the reception staff were frosty. The area, although not dangerous, is not ideal. The walk to the Bund is indirect and not pleasant and the location is not handy for a metro. Travel by taxi is easiest. I wouldnt recommend the hotel on location alone, even ignoring the problems with the staff. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"English speaking? I've both lived in Shanghai and had to visit on business. I have stayed at a small hotel (not listed) in the same area. Guys, please, it's NOT in a dangerous area of Shanghai. The lack of super-bright street lighting we're used to in the west can make Shanghai streets seem dark and dangerous. They are not. You are missing out on a huge part of real Shanghai if you're locking yourself in your room at night. The area the hotel is in has a long history and is home to normal Shanghai people... get out and go exploring, even at night, you will come across bustling street markets, food stalls, people chilling in their PJs, ;) etc etc.About 90% of the staff not speaking english... this is China, for heavens sake! Only at the very top hotels here will all the staff speak English, even then the housekeeping maids will very likely not ever speak English as they are relatively low-paid workers. If you dont want to be shocked at a hotel's staff not speaking English, visit Australia, USA, UK, .....Enjoy Shanghai!! :D "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Location is the problem Although the hotel was economical and generally a nice facility, the location leaves a lot to be desired. It's just not that easy to get to - taxis have to either do an awkward U-Turn in the middle of a busy street, or run around some awkward blocks. I did not have any cabs refuse to go there, but it was always a hassle for them. Walking is ok, but a longer walk to Nanjing Road and the Bund than you might expect, and it is easy to get turned around. At night it is dark and a bit of a scary neighborhood for Westerners on their first visit to China. We were there with friends &amp; discovered that each room was a unique layout. We were in room 513 - Our view was of the old section of Shanghai - nothing to write home about, but interesting to see. The bedroom was smaller than our friends had - and there were 3 steps up to where the bed was - the bathroom was on the lower level. Bathroom was modern and clean. We had a shower and a jacuzzi tub. There was a working room safe, which we appreciated. Beds were firm (not rock hard) and overall the room was very comfortable. There is a Business Center in the lobby where we checked the internet - 30 Yuan for 20 minutes, or something like that. We found the staff very helpful - a bellboy knew perfect English &amp; the rest of the staff tried very hard to help us whenever we asked them, including going out into the street to hail us a cab. The breakfast buffet was fine - I liked getting a fresh omelette made to order every morning. The meals in the lobby bar were actually good, more than pub fare. In the end, the hotel itself was fine and a good value, but I did not like the location. If you are young and like to walk a long way in the shadows of Shanghai, then it might be ok - otherwise, if you stay here, just determine that you will take a taxi. Fortunately, taxis in Shanghai are very reasonable - you can go all over town for just a few dollars. I recommend an evening boat ride on the river and on a nice day, go up the Pearl Tower. In the evening, go to the Grand Hyatt in Pudong (stay there if you can afford it!) The lobby is on the 54th floor. Get reservations for the restaurant at the top, or just go to the Cloud 9 Lounge (one of the world's highest - great views) and go back to level 54 for a reasonable dinner without reservations. Pudong side is newer and more western, but the sights you want to see and the shopping are primarily on the other (older) side of the river. If you want to walk to shopping and sight-seeing, choose something close to or on Nanjing Road. Be sure to see the Shanghai museum in People's Square and the adjacent museum with the entire city plan (model) of Shanghai. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Interesting room layout - great view towards Pudong Stayed at room 1422. Nice size, with an interesting design, separating entrance, bathroom and living area. The room seemed well kept, and the bathroom clean.After arrival, taking a shower, the water stayed in the bathtub. I issued a complaint, when leaving for a nightly boat-tour on the Pudong river, and the problem was solved, when I returned.Although the room was on the 14. floor traffic noise was still relatively strong; but sleep came without problem anyway (10 hours flight with no sleep does that to you). Did not experience noise from other rooms.The view from the room was toward the Pudong river near The Bund; no complaints here.Internet was 50RMB per 24. hours (standard ethernet), but the login did not work. I contacted technical assistance, and they promised to call back within 5 minutes. I told them, I had to go out on the town within 20 minutes. I heard nothing more on this, and did not use internet in the hotel. The room has dual power outlets for european and australasian plugs for 220V 50 Hz.The hotel has MasterCard ATM in the lobby. The breakfast restaurant was well stocked, and seemed to be able to cater for most tastes. The elevators had built-in safety alarms. When the elevator is overloaded, a really impressive alarm tone is sounded, and everything stops until the offending party leaves the elevator. It is extremely annoying to be the offending party, alas... it gives confidence in the designers of the hotel. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"They do not speak english I stayed in this hotel early November, it is to my horror that almost 90% of their hotel staff do not speak english, most of the guest have hard time communicating with the staff. Though the room was quite good, but the room layout is not that impressive as it does not prrovide a good view, instead a view of another hotel room. "
hengsheng peninsula international hotel ,"Nice hotel sketchy location This hotel had great, spacious rooms however, it is located in a somewhat secluded area, near a series of highways. I'm not sure how unsafe it actually is but I was uncomfortable with the idea of walking outside late at night and we had trouble getting taxis to take us back to the hotel since it located in such an isolated area. It is very affordable however, and the rooms are immaculate and clean. The concierge and staff are not very friendly but the hotel is nicely designed. "

hilton shanghai ,"Be prepared to pay for the air you breath This hotel is exactly what to expect from a business hotel in a rather uninspiring place such as Shanghai can be: professional service, clean and functional rooms, good international breakfast and SPA.The only issue I had with them was that they made me (or try to) pay for anything they could: when I checked in the tried to upsell me an upgrade to the executive floor, which I was about to accept until I discovered that I had to pay if I wanted to bring in a guest in the lounge; next I went to the business center to print some documents and they wanted to charge me for the time I needed to access my email to retrieve the documents, fortunately a bit of reasoning with the attendant saved me the money; last but not least they charged me to get into the sauna, this I couldn't escape as I really needed some relax but I never heard before such a charge. "
hilton shanghai ,"Very Good Hotel but Food at the Lounge Below the Average... First of all, I would like to say I am used to travelling in Asia Pacific, especially in Hilton Hotels. Actually, I am a Hilton Honor VIP Diamond. Therefore, I have access to the lounge in all Hilton Hotels where I stay. I am also used to staying in Hilton Shanghai.This hotel offers a good service (all the team is customer focused and friendly) and is very well located, just near Puxi district, the underground line 2 (5 minute walk), as well as shopping malls, good restaurants or bars. The gym is also very good with a tennis court, a squash court and a small swimming pool ~15 meters (still a little bit cold...). The SPA proposes good packages with a skilled staff and the wet area is nice (hamman, jacuzzi, sauna). Still, the women area is sometimes very noisy and the staff should sometimes remind what is cleanliness to some customers... This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, even in the wet area.As far as the food is concerned, restaurants like Leonardo, People on the Water, Sichuan, Atrium a la carte, are very good with reasonable prices (i.e. compared with other 5 star hotels in Shanghai). Still, the overall quality of the buffet (lunch, dinner) has decreased for the past 7~9 months (i.e. compared with other 5 star hotels in Shanghai) and seems to now target local customers and not anymore international ones: may be a cheap &quot;Shanghai style&quot; buffet..., lower price than elsewhere but...On the contrary, the buffet breakfast is still very good. Large choice, very good break, very good pastries, very good everything.The lounge (it offers a wonderful view of Shanghai and is new).This review and comparison are based on experiences in other lounges in Hilton Beijing (2 hotels), Hilton Seoul, Hilton Hanoi, Hilton Kuala Lumpur, Hilton Singapore where the quality level is similar from one hotel to another.Unfortunately, the tea time and the evening snacks in Hilton Shanghai are below the average of the other Hilton lounges.1) Tea Time:- Pastries (small tarts and cakes) are proposed in a limited amount. Once the 25 or so cakes are finished, the stock is not renewed. Whatever time is 3.30, 4.00 or 4.30 pm. Moreover, if some of those 25 or so cakes remain after the tea time, they are left on the table for the evening snacks...- There are no cut fruits- There are no chocolates.2) Evening snacks:- Wine: the only proposed wine is Chinese. Otherwise, you have to pay for foreign wine. Even in Hilton Beijing you can enjoy free Australian or Chili wine...- Food: for the past 5 months, the menu snacks has not been changed at all. The food remains the same: the same pasta, the same beef, the same pizza, the same... You never enjoy fish or any change.- There are no cut fruits.- There are no pastries.- There are no chocolates.Those weaknesses make a great difference with what you can enjoy in other Hilton lounges in Asia Pacific.To conclude with, a very good hotel with a very good service but a lounge which needs some improvements for the satisfaction of customers. "
hilton shanghai ,"this Hilton high on my list... We enjoyed every part of our 3 night stay at the Hilton in Shanghai. Although we were part of a group, the great service we received was no less than if we had been here on our own. Our room was beautiful, housekeeping was very responsive to any little request, and all hotel personnel went out of their way to be helpful. The neighborhood was lovely to walk around, with lots of interesting local shops &amp; restaurants. The nearby park was especially tranquil after the bustle of the city. "
hilton shanghai ,"the new China My husband &amp; I visited Shanghai, China Oct '09 and were astonished to be seeing into the future. Everything about the city, from the Hilton Hotel where we stayed, to the local stores where we shopped, to the amazing skyscrapers in the Pudong area, was an eye-opening experience. The people were helpful &amp; friendly everywhere. I encourage tourists to walk around off the beaten path and get to see where our world is headed. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good place to stay - relaxing Been here on a tight biz journey. Flew in on tue and stated to work the very next minute I landed. In the evening got to the hotle and discovered it's very nice SPA with all kinds of massage and hot/cold tubs and 2 kinds of sauna. Great for a tired traveller. Good restourant, nice jazz club at 39th floor. Rooms are large. Rates are quite good. Met several other frequent travellers that come here 7-8 imes a year, always same hotel. "
hilton shanghai ,Pleasant stay Very good service. We asked for a king bed in the reservation but when we checked in we got twin beds. The staff were extremely prompt in moving us to another room. Nice Samsung flat screen tv. Unfortunately the Hilton pool was under renovation so we had to go to the Equatorial Hotel next door. We had a nice view from the room on the 17th floor. Buffet breakfast in the Atrium was pretty good. Good selection of western and chinese food items. Can't comment on the location as we had pre-arranged transportation on a tour. 
hilton shanghai ,"Just So So and expensive restaurant! I chose Hilton because its location is close to the pick up point (shuttle bus which offered by Ningbo hotel). Well, the room is clean but a bit outdated. Following have to improve :1. Staff - cannot feel they are welcoming you, you ask something and they replied very short with a cold face2. Spa - massage fully booked and no in room services provide3. Restaurant - I ordered Lobster Spagetti at Italian Restaurant (remember to get a RMB100coupon from the complimentary water which can deduct when checkout). It is the first time I experienced cook in front of me for the spagetti as I believe it should cook by a chef. If I can find this info in the menu, I will not take risk. In general, it is usually just make crepe, beef tartar, soup or fresh mix salad in front of the customer! Well, a waiter put my lobster and cook quite slowly and keep stir &amp; stir almost 10mins! I cannot help to ask what he is doing as the lobster will overcook! He replied is waiting for the spagetti from kitchen to mix together! Hey! If you want to make a cook show, why don't you well prepare and it is ridicoulus! Finally, it taste so so and it cannot compare to cook in real kitchen! If the chef is on holiday, pls don't offer as it cost RMB280!!!Breaksfast - Not much choice but some special food provided like fig (not dried one) but not fresh at all.Finally, the bell boy make this hotel a bit positive. It is heavy rain when I check out, he helping me to take my luggage to the bus station which almost 10mins by walk.P.S. Swimming pool is under renovation. If you need a swim, they can arrange you to use in the hotel just next door. "
hilton shanghai ,"In need of upgrade.... and better service! Last time I stayed in a Deluxe Plus room, which was nice....This time I stayed at a normal Deluxe room. If a toilet needs to be flushed 4 times to be empty - then there is something seriously in need to be upgraded,A very disappointing 2nd visit to the same hotel in 4 weeks,I am also disappointed that none of the hotel bellboys made any effort to hail down the cabs, even though there was a long queue at the hotel taxi line and we can see many empty taxis driving by on the main road. Very disappointing. "
hilton shanghai ,"Very nice! A saviour in in a time of need. I travel for a living and stay in hotels more than 200 nights each year. I've stayed in all manner of hotels and the Hilton Shanghai rates way up there. We took our extended adult family to China on vacation. We booked another hotel in Shanghai and it was terrible. We moved to the Hilton after 1 night at the disgusting hotel and we were treated like royalty. The hotel is in the Jing'An area, the heart of Shanghai and very centrally located for everything. The assistant manager James greeted us upon check-in and he and his assistant Carrie checked us all in. They were both courteous and efficient but the pampering started when he offered to extend my Hilton Honors Privileges to my entire group which allowed us to use the Executive Level lounge. Our rooms were lovely and spotlessly clean as were the bathrooms. The beds were the best in China (known for its extra hard beds) and a welcome respite after each day of sight seeing and shopping. All the staff from the doormen to the managers greeted us warmly each day but a special thanks goes out to Patrick, the manager in the Atrium Cafe who fed my family each morning and Diana, the manager of the Executive Lounge, who welcomed us in each evening and helped us unwind with complimentary cocktails and appetizers. She personally saw to all our needs. The Penthouse Bar on 39 has a great atmosphere with wonderful views of the city. The jazz act there, &quot;3's Company&quot;, is wonderful and the service is very attentive. I cannot say enough good things about the helpful, friendly staff! The spa is also very nice even if a bit small but very well equiped with fitness equipment and relaxation areas.I do have one complaint - the food in the hotel, while delicious, is too expensive. Breakfast averages about $25 per person and I just think that is too much. The hotel is now about 20 years old and I feel it probably could use a remodeling but I hate to end on a negative note so I will say again that we had a wonderful five days at the Hilton Shanghai and we all agreed we would love to stay there again soon. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good hotel but not best location for turists The hotel is good but not excelent. The room is acceptable large and it has all you need. I sugest you to ask for a high floor with a view as the sorrundings are worth it. Unfortunatelly the hotel is not in the center, so if you are a turist wanting to visit the city you will need to take a taxi (the fare is about 8 USD). From this perspective, Raddisson, Marriott and Sofitel are located exactly in the center. If I will go back to Shanghai, I will stay at one of these. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good experience for the price Had a good promotion and was overall greatly satisfied with the service and cleaniness of the hotel. Breakfast was good and with many bread choices. SPA is nice but with strange system: you pay for going to the sauna, but not to the pool.... In total a good hotel, a bit tired room wise but great location and service! "
hilton shanghai ,"Acceptable but unlikely to visit again We stayed at the Hilton Shanghai on 23 and 24 July. Unfortunately we were very late getting in from Hong Kong (due to some visas issues – make sure that if you come from Hong Kong and plan to return to China that you have a multiple-entry visa), but since the room was prepaid it was waiting for us. We were informed that the taxi charge from the airport should be around RMB 150 – we were charged RMB 220 (by meter) as I suspect the driver took a long route around.The rooms are average compared to the other 5-star hotels in which we have stayed. The rooms look outdated, as it appears is the hotel generally. The hotel is situated far from the action of the city, i.e. the main river through Shanghai is very far away. There is no separate shower, but rather a shower in the bath (and strangely enough a separate shower head in the roof – watch out for this as it will be chilly if you are not expecting it).The breakfast selection is very good.There is an excellent massage center around the back of the hotel (go outside the hotel, turn left and walk down the alley to the left – ask for number 32 (this is nu of the lady that worked on our feet)).One thing that I found very unreasonable was the price of using the Internet in their business center. They charge an exorbitant (and I would even say extortionate) amount of RMB 4 per minute to use the Internet (compare this to RMB 5 per hour that we paid in Shigatse). In a supposed world-class hotel, this is a ridiculous price to charge guests – they should make it a lot more reasonable, if not free. This was my final annoyance of staying at this hotel.Other than the outdated room, the location of the hotel, the shower in the bath and the very expensive business center, this hotel is OK, though I suspect I will stay somewhere else should we make it back to Shanghai. "
hilton shanghai ,Very good hotel-friendly service and spacious rooms I stayed in this hotel on a business trip in August. The breakfast is amongst one of the best/varied ones I have ever experienced. You can skip lunch if you've had a round or two from the big buffet. Because we had a late night flight we were allowed to occupy our room until 20:00 at night at no additional cost-great service!On the down side inernet acces costs RMB 120/day. You'd expect a 5 star hotel to offer complimentary internet service...It's conveniently located near an underground station for onward travel. Aircon worked fantastic-an absolute must in August. Views from the penthouse bar on the 39th floor are amazing at night. For the 70EUR I paid per night it was very good value for money. Will stay there again on my next business trips. 
hilton shanghai ,"Hilton A #1 good for customer The service at this hotel is the best I have ever received. The staff was always kind and friendly and always on point with directions or lending a helping hand. The rooms were clean, showers had great water pressure, and beds were heavenly. If I come back to Shanghai, I'll definitely stay here. Great food too "
hilton shanghai ,"Book with confidence! Very nice place... [Perspective: I am a 7~8 of 10 on a picky hotel guest scale]This hotel did a fantastic job making me feel comfortable, productive, &amp; interested in my surroundings during my 4-night stay. rIncluded photos of my room 2903. Was automatically upgraded pe my Hilton Diamond status &amp; had access to highly recmnded Executive Lounge on 38th floor - where breakfast, afternoon tea, 'happy hour' drinks, &amp; light snacks could be found. Lounge quite &amp; very comfortable seating with easy access to power outlets. No kiddies under 13 allowed in ExcLnge. Open lounge/bar on 39th floor is equally nice with full menu (ClubSndwch good) &amp; Tiger Beer on tap. Great(!) 3-pce lounge band from S.Africa plays - piano, upright bass, female voice. Lobby Lounge great for meetings &amp; people watching. 700rooms so lots of people. 6 fast elevators, min waiting. Lobby resturant had excellent breakfast options - equal to any Asian hotel I've stayed. Something for everyone for this critical meal! Excellent frothy coffee.. (must use FrenchPress or great machine). Fresh squeezed OJ. Bacon could usually be done a bit more for me - but can pick pces. Architecture in lobby/resturant not avant-garde or inspiring but neither 'drab'... Excellent staff - all spoke English well. Never had &quot;attitude&quot; from any... Location is a bit isolated from most interesting parts of city - but taxis always ready-&amp;-waiting outside. Typically you can get anywhere within city for $4~$10 USD (28~68 RMB). Just remember to bring map/info card hotel gives you @ check-in with Chinese/English to communicate with taxi drives who rarely speak English. Room was comfortable &amp; quiet. Very nice bed/duvet! High-speed wired &amp; wireless reliable. Several eng TV channels. Two comp waters per day. Good safe. Desk chair nice. A/C blows on you while working - burrrr... bummer. I adjusted vanes in duct to not blow on me = better. Bathroom contemporary, clean &amp; nice. Ceiling or hand shower head option. Excellent water pressure &amp; temp stability. Enough room for one/two people. I'd stay at this hotel again in second. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good Value decent business hotel I stayed here on the business trip becuase of the excellent 'two for one' offer available on the internet.The rooms are standard size, with good beds. My room seemed to have been renovated recently &amp; everything worked well. The bath is far too shallow, and the shower is poor.I used the executive lounge for meetings and breakfast. No complaints, a bit busier than most. but I always found a seat.The only real negative is the food in the lobby which was very poor, and what have they done to the draft Tiger lager, undrinkable.In summary, a good value top end buisness hotel, but if you were looking for luxury, a destination hotel, or a decent bath, you would go elesewhere. The 'two for one' offer made it excellent value for money. "
hilton shanghai ,"Fabulous Stay at Hilton Shanghai We were considered Executive Customers and were entitled to the Executive Lounge with their free wifi, continental breakfast, afternoon, tea, and evening cocktails. Our room was also located on an Executive Floor. Everything single thing about the room, the Lounge, and the service we received at the Hotel was fabulous. I inquired about the Sichuan Restaurant on the top floor and within minutes, the manager of that restaurant was downstairs speaking directly to me about their food, assuring me that the evening we wanted to dine there they would make certain there would be dishes available to us that would not be too spicy for our taste. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone! "
hilton shanghai ,"A bit drab.... Stayed for a couple of nights. Check in was efficient and staff were friendly but the hotel shower did not work. Loved the huge LCD TV in the living room. Room service was fantastic, food came with flowers, mint sweets, and all beautifully presented and laid out. Bed was nice and comfy. Furniture was old and threadbare though. The wallpaper a bit worn out and the wooden furnture eg cabinets and all in desperate need of a makeover...Took a taxi to the airport which took 1.5hours due to traffic and construction along the highway - so please note travellers. Normally would be an hour journey. I'd still recommend this for travellers as it does not cost too much for the value you get but if you had children, I would give it a miss. "
hilton shanghai ,"'Precious' lounge rules. My family of three recently stayed in the Shanghai Hilton and having stayed in many, many Hiltons all over the world, found the Executive lounge to be the most pretentious in all 'Hilton-dom'. They have a very archaic (by today's standards) dress code of no shorts or sandals or sportswear. One man came to breakfast with trousers and sandals and was chastised and was asked to go and change. I don't think one should appear in their bathrobe (as I saw in a Hilton lounge once) but this hotel seems bent on maintaining British standards of a bygone era, along with matching stilted and unfriendly attitudes. It is very different to the Beijing (Wanfujing) Hilton where they cannot do enough for you. The room was average and the bathroom small and dated. Definitely nothing special. "
hilton shanghai ,Everything is nice! This is a nice hotel locating at the center of Shanghai and just few minutes walk to subway. The room is nice and equiped with big LCD TV. The breakfast is those 5-star hotel quality. 
hilton shanghai ,"Great Location Location - Great, only 5 mins walk from MTR, easy to locate it once get out from the station.Check-in/out - typical Hilton styleRoom - Spacious but a little bit old style, doors of the wardrobe have to repair as it can't close up completelySwimming Poor - great to have indoor one as the air outside are not good;Service - staff at concierge r smart, they can tell me the exact taxi fare of the place where i'm going to!!! wonderful!!! besides, they r willing to help me in making dinning reservation! made me saved a lot of time in checking out the places and roaming charges~ "
hilton shanghai ,"A Hotel living on its past repotation reputation - An anachronism I stay in 5 star hotels all over the world and always on the executive floor, so I have a basis for comparison. I found this hotel particularly poor in terms of customer service and responsiveness to needs. if there is a problem, the General manager, Guy Hutchinson, is not available - for someone in the hospitality industry, he seems to have an aversion to dealing with his guests. The problems with this hotel is that because it bears the Hilton name, it attracts guest and must enjoy a high occupancy rate and therefore does not feel the need to improve. At one time this was a posh Hotel with little competition, now it is old and tired, even to the point that staff in the executive lounge feel it is OK to treat guests rudely. There are son many new, modern and beautiful hotels in CShanghai - avoid this one : :caveat emptor.&quot; "
hilton shanghai ,"Great stay! Stayed there on a two-week business trip. Staff is accomodating, ready to help, constantly smiling. Excellent service at the lounge in particular, which I accessed daily through a colleague of mine. Fares appeared reasonable, including food/wine. Fitness center is well equipped; pool is very nice. As to rooms, mine needed some refurbishment but met my expectations in terms of overall size, comfort, cleanliness and equipment. To sum it up, a very good choice! "
hilton shanghai ,"Great Hotel Great Service Great Executive Lounge Staff I thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at the Hilton Shanghai...Great looking lobby, great room (a remodeled room), and fantastic service. I arrived later in the evening and was promptly assisted by a bellman from the taxi. I approached the check-in desk, and was told that because I am a HHonors Diamond member, that I'd been upgraded to an Executive Floor room, and to go up to the 38th floor for check in. Upon arrival to the lounge, I was offered a beverage of my choice (I had a beer) and was efficiently checked in. The check-in guy apologized profusely that there was not an actual room available on the executive floor, but he did have a recently remodeled room on the 'good view' side of the hotel on the 27th floor. Fine with me, as I still had full Executive Lounge privileges (full breakfast in the AM, afternoon tea with snacks, evening cocktails and appetizers). The room was good, nothing overly special, but comfortable--great bed, fair bathroom but great water pressure in the shower. 10 minutes after check-in, a knock on my door brought a HUGE basket of fruit (probably 20 small mangoes). I wanted for nothing in the lounge, constantly offered refills, greeted by name upon arrival each time, and free wifi internet access there.I ate one meal in the Atrium 'coffee shop'. I just had a sandwich and soup, but the food quality was very good, although the service ran a little slow. I did venture out near the hotel--directly across the street were several pubs...I ventured into one and had a couple of cold beers--a little pricey for Shanghai, but surely better than the hotel bar. Be careful when venturing out near the hotel...I was propositioned for a 'massage' by a professional woman one evening, and every night there were very clever beggars who shamelessly send their young children to pester you for money relentlessly. I hope I can score a good rate here again next time I'm in Shanghai...It's a great hotel with great service and definitely lives up to the 5-stars granted by the Chinese Tourism Bureau. "
hilton shanghai ,"Disappointed 3.5 star service We 3 adults stayed for 2 nights with a tour package. Although I saw there were a lot of Hilton fans, I am disappointed for its not up to 4 (not to say 5) star service:1. More than 1 month ago I wrote emails directly to this hotel (and also later through my agent) reminding our special requests including 3 separate beds, non-smoking. I have received their confirmation that this would be arranged. Upon check-in, I realised that what I'd done were useless. I was asked whether I'd like smoking or non-smoking room, and so I had to repeat all my special requests.2. The room given was not prepared for 3 persons. The staff at check-in told they would come to add a bed. Until we'd wait in the room for an unreasonable length of time and my chase call, no one came in to add an extra bed or provide one more set of things including the slippers, cups for our immediate use.3. The bell boy didn't each time tell the taxi driver where we were going and I had to say it myself (but the boy had asked us where we were going beforehand).4. Front desk staff are not informative. A staff even gave me wrong information on the hotel lounges.5. At breakfast which is a buffet, used plates were always not collected.Shanghai has so many famous 5 star hotels and I don' t think this should be the one recommended. "
hilton shanghai ,"Still the one... I stayed at this &quot;new&quot; hotel in 1994 and have been coming back ever since.In many ways, it's the same hotel improved and upgraded along the way. Demand a renovated room, the old rooms are really old.This stay was on the Executive floor RMB 1900/night. Excellent room, small bathroom (old hotel dimensions) good b-fast and top notch service.China does sometimes overdoes it with the 5-star &quot;everyone must be served&quot; attitude...ask a simple question and get bombarded with answers and solutions until you have to run away to think it all through. All I asked was what time breakfast buffet was finished....Bar on 39th floor still good but needs a serious make-over.I'll be back! "
hilton shanghai ,"This is the place to stay in Shanghai Being a Hilton Honors member the Hilton Shanghai was my first choice when taking my family to visit family in China. I had read the reviews on trip advisor and was fairly confident with my choice. The stay far exceeded any expectations we had. The hotel is beautiful, convenient and the service is top notch! I felt very comfortable having my teenagers use all the services in the hotel as well as walking around the neighborhood. If there was one issue it would be that there is no gift shop. Should you need a personal item (which was our case) it was hard to communicate with the language barrier what we needed. It would have been nice to just walk in a gift shop and pick up our item! The executive floor services offer 3 servings per day. Aside from the coffee (sorry no Starbucks) everything was fresh and very good. The location is excellent for shopping and dining. Nothing seemed to take more than 15 minutes except of course the airport! Don't think twice. If this is in your budget stay at the Hilton! "
hilton shanghai ,"elegant and comfortable hotel Very elegant 5* hotel in best location. Service was excellent. Wellness is great (SPA, Sauna, hot tube). The pool has little ambient. Roof bar offers great view and great cocktails. "
hilton shanghai ,"Hilton name still good I stayed two nights 1/Apr and 2/Apr/09, the room furnitures and bath room bit old and outdate but still very clean. At lease the TV is 40 inch LCD., Also, I enjoy the indoor swimming pool and the sauna room and all gym facility. The opening hours from7:00am till 11:00pm long opening hours, suitable for both Business and Leisure customers can use all the facility at different hours. The breakfast is good, with all different kind of foods both in Chinese and European. I enjoy my staying at this hoteland the prices is very reasonable. Also, only a short walking distance (about 5 mins)from the underground to the hotel. I will use this hotel next time. "
hilton shanghai ,"Renovated rooms are nice I have stayed at this hotel several times in the last few years. If you get one of the renovated rooms, you get the updated furnishings in the bedroom, (flat screen TV and nice work desk etc) but the older rooms have very dated furniture and questionable electrical cord/outlets. Bathroom could use renovation as well. There seems to be no price difference, so I would ask for renovated room even if the room size is smaller. Most of the time, there's a line at the front desk for check-in/check-out, so I recommend giving yourself some extra time for check-out in the morning. The hotel has a very nice fitness room with state of the art equipment. If you are in the mood for going out for dinner, I'd recommend extra time waiting in line for taxi in the evening as well. "
hilton shanghai ,"very pleasing choice stayed here in Feb 09 on a sale rate available from the hotel website, excellent value, i think we were in a very basic room category but was quite pleased with the state of the room, very clean and comfortable and a nice view over french concession townhouses.had absolutely no problems with check in and all services. its a very busy hotel so you can be as anonymous as you like or take up the many services, depends on your style. the breakfast in the lobby was good, nice atmosphere and good range. however the taste of shanghai water is rather heavily chemicalised, not the hotels fault though.people have talked about the location being far from the bund and peoples square main drag, well, shanghai is a huge city so i guess it depends on what areas you want to visit as to whether the location is a problem. we found the location good for exploring the western side of the city, jingan temple nearby, french concession area at the doorfront, and with the subway not too far away it is easy to get to other areas. the hotel is also right next to an overhead expressway so its easy to get in and out.gym facilities were good, heaps of cardio machines and about 6-7 life fitness machines, some fitness classes available too. indoor pool was lovely, also a good size. jacuzzi, sauna and steam was clean, attractive and well run. in sum, a great choice, would definitely go back. "
hilton shanghai ,"Upscale but Inconvenient Impressive service, style, and rooms for a Hilton, though not very friendly for a first-time visitor looking to explore the city by foot &amp; metro. Location was a five minute walk from the closest subway station, and a difficult one at that with luggage due to the pedestrian overpasses without working escalators. Highlight was &quot;The Penthouse&quot; bar up on the 38th floor, which was a relaxing, friendly place to wrap my busy days. "
hilton shanghai ,"Not up to Hilton Standards Upon arrival we were charged an additional amount for the full board we had booked on line, due to an increase. The price was too expensive for the quality of food we were offered.The weather was just turning cool but the heat was on full blast. If you turned the thermostat to AC, the heat came on instead. We complained and the front desk said it was &quot;heat time&quot; and it could not be changed. Tempature at night was 80 degrees. "
hilton shanghai ,Great Staff and Executive Lounge We recently stayed at the Shanghai Hilton. We were in town for business meetings and the location was fairly convenient to my husbands meetings.We loved the Executive Lounge. They were very attentive and had a great breakfast in the mornings. I think by my 3rd day there the staff at the Executive Lounge knew that I always had a Diet Coke around 11am and when I would walk in they were ask &quot;diet coke?&quot;. Very nice and attentive.The lobby was always very active with lots of people meeting and chatting. Great vibe. Lobby bar was a good place to be at the end of the day.The hotel probably had like 5 or 6 restaurants. I had lunch at least once at the Atirum restaurant. They have a menu lunch or buffet lunch.The location was good and the room had the usual amenities.Bottom line: Good hotel with great atmosphere and very attentive friendly staff.We would stay there again. 
hilton shanghai ,"Consistently high quality Stayed at this property many times before.This time I managed to get a brand-new (at least that's how it smelled) business room on the executive floor. Two short nights unfortunately did not allow a visit to the executive lounge.Extremely functional and nice room, loved the bed and the bathroom was also very nicely decorated.Enjoyed the breakfast downstairs at the Lobby level; great choice (nice German choice). Incredibly efficient.All in all, a very convenient hotel in great location. Not too far from the old Shanghai airport but about 45 to 60 minutes drive to Pudong Airport.An extremely well oiled machinery; super staff, well done! "
hilton shanghai ,"Good! Stayed here 3 nights Saturday - Tuesday - on business trip. Nice room - and very nice staff in the lobby area, very helpful and very friendly - one of the best I've experienced.Only thing that I can complain on is that one breakfast, the breakfast area was a little busy - and the attention was not up to standard. Had to ask hunt down the waiters for coffee. The other 2 days was alright. "
hilton shanghai ,"A bit business orientated but not bad Not a bad hotel, good foyer though nothing spectacular, quite a good area close to the French quarter and quite good for getting out and about.. The rooms are not bad,, smallish for European Chinese hotels and there is ample supplies of everything you need. Overall adequate and above average. Okay value for money. I stayed twice so i felt it was worth another go. There are better hotels in Shanghai, but for the money which is again pretty average you get well looked after. Would i go again. Yes but i would always feel i did fine but it is not all that memorable. "
hilton shanghai ,"Great Value I've stayed at a LOT of hotels in China and this is one of the best values for the money. It's not the Ritz, the Four Seasons or other 5 star international hotels. But it's clean and nice, the bed is comfortable, the room service was fast and good, the gym and spa are excellent and the service was impeccable. They went out of their way, from the doormen, to the housekeepers to the room service stewards, to be friendly and helpful. I'll definitely stay here again.The only negative is that the Internet connection was slow and the TV one of the older and smaller tube versions. But these are small relative to all of the positives. "
hilton shanghai ,"Very good and getting better This is the second time that I have stayed at this centrally located, business oriented hotel. The level of service remains very high and the hotel is obviously aspiring to maintain its high level of service with a major remodeling of 7 or so floors.Although this is a business oriented hotel, I recommend it for families and tourists (solo or group) because, in the former case (at the time of writing), breakfast is free for kids under 18, and because in the latter case the hotel is very well run and well located. It is close to the Jing an temple subway, Shanghai's two major airports--though it is closer to Hongqiao than the Pudong airport, and in walking distance of several atttractions/major streets (it is about 15 minutes to Huai Hai Lu and 30-45 minutes to the best part of Huai Hai Lu).If you are a business traveler, you absolutely should work on your Hilton Honors points because if you are a member with sufficient status, you may have a chance to upgrade to the Executive floor as well as to take advantage of the wonderful Executive Lounge (which offers breakfast, cocktail hour, and some other nice amenities). Of course, you can always pay to stay on the Executive Floor, but it is not cheap.Given the aforementioned remodeling/reconstruction, you should check carefully as to the location of your room as this may affect noise levels.As with many other places in Shanghai, there is construction in the environs of the hotel. So far this has not eliminated the cheap restaurants/small shops in the area so take advantage of these options while you can.Unless prices change dramaticaly, I would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I am in Shanghai.HINT: Do ask for a view East as you may be able to see the Jin Mao and International Financial Centers (two of Shanghai's tallest buildings) and the Pearl TV tower. "
hilton shanghai ,"Stay with a baby Nice hotel, in line with Hilton standards. The location is not so close to the most interesting places in Shanghai, like Bund, People Square (and his museums), Pudong, Yu Gardens. Around the hotel there are not so much places for dinner, but Xintiandi is at 10 minutes by taxi. I travelled with a baby and the staff helped me for everything (babycot and highchair in the room, for example). Breakfast and dinner had a good choice of dishes. "
hilton shanghai ,"Wonderful hotel in a great location First trip to Shanghai. We loved the property from the staff attitudes to the large, airy lobby and restaurants to the very comfortable rooms. It is away from the downtown mob and Pudong construction, is close to many restaurants in the French Concession, and is a half-block away from the metro. When space was available, we were upgraded to the executive floors with its first-rate club lounge. Before that, we were comped a very nice breakfast in the downstairs lobby. Very attractive property with great workout facilities. When not eating at local restaurants, we enjoyed the upstairs Sichuan restaurant very much.The Jing'an Temple metro stop (Line 2) is just across the freeway, a five minute walk with an elevated walkway to get across the main street. The metro was far more convenient for many destinations than a cab and made trips to People's Square, East Nanjing Road, and Pudong fast and reliable. Escalators (almost always working) made the short trip between the metro and hotel even easier. With lots of luggage, a cheap 11 yuan taxi ride gets you to/from the hotel.Since the hotel is in the French Concession, many good restaurants are within walking distance or a very short taxi ride. Plus, there are lots of trees, some nice parks, and no crush of high-rise buildings. "
hilton shanghai ,Great Stay Great stay in a well organised hotel with excellent facilities.View and service from 39th floor bar impressive.The best hotel I have stayed at in Shanghai Can thoroughly recommend.The food was good as well.Visitor from New Zealand 
hilton shanghai ,"Wow! What a GREAT place! This was my 5th trip to Shanghai, but the first time in the Shanghai Hilton. To start with, one on the Assistant Managers met me at the curb, by name, and escorted me to a private desk where she promptly checked me into the hotel. This is typical of the customer service at this hotel. Every employee greats you with a simple hello or even nod of the head, and are always there for questions, directions, etc. I upgraded to the &quot;executive&quot; floor which offered free drinks and heavy snacks in the evening, I believe from 6 to 8. The lounge was located on one of the higher floors (26 I think and has a great view of the city. They also offer a full breakfast included in the &quot;upgrade&quot;. Again, the staff in the executive lounge was great!!I ate in the hotel the first night and the buffet was very good and reasonably priced. There are several restauraunts and bars in the hotel. I recommend the Penthouse bar, which has an amazing view of the city!As for location, there appears to be lots around the hotel, althought I really did not get out and wander around much. As in other parts of the city, I felt very safe getting out and walking around, there is little crime there and it &quot;feels'&quot; very much like a western city.The room iteself was very comfortable and looked new. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Shanghai. "
hilton shanghai ,"Great - would stay there again Stayed two nights on business. Very nice room, nice breakfast with good atmosphere in the restaurant, nice bakery, etc. Will stay there again next time I visit Shanghai, no question. "
hilton shanghai ,"Treated like a King - Huge Executive Lounge I stayed for 3 nights, since I am a HH Gold was directed to executive lounge upon check in. This lounge has just opened up in late January and is impressive. It is Huge, wraps around the entire east and south side. Many plasma tv and tasteful Chinese decoration. Since someone else was being checked in, I was invited to sit down in one of the many sofas and enjoy a welcome cocktail. Staff was extremely friendly, the best English speaking staff I have had in China. Remembered my name throughout the 3 days. Was given an executive floor upgrade, full access to lounge for breakfast, afternoon hot and cold snacks, plenty that it was enough for my dinner. Free internet. Free drinks from 5-7, I tried for first time Chinese wine and was impressed, and I am a fan of wine. Room was spacious, all amenities of a Hilton, welcome fruit, flowers and chocolates in a nice bamboo box. Large plasma tv. One day after being exhausted of walking the entire day, used the spa, very nice. Had relaxing rooms, steam, sauna, hot tubs, etc. Large indoor pool. Offers spinning, yoga, free weights. Very nice spa.The location is on the west side of the city, can be distant if you want to stick to Bund or Pudong, but it is a quick cab ride away, quicker by metro. I got there from airport by taking Maglev, then transferring to metro line 2. You get out by the jing an temple, walk south one block towards park and elevated highway, take pedestrian overpass the had non functioning escalators which was a hugr nuisance and then the Hilton is on the right hand side. Easy to get around by subway. It is on the west end of French concession area, so a 10-15 minute walk to central area of French concession area and Huaihai road. Overall excellent service, best executive lounge that I have been to date. Only con would be location if you want to be on Nanjing road, Bund or Pudong, but personally would not be willing to give up service and amenities for location for the rate I was paying. "
hilton shanghai ,"As Nice as It Gets The Hilton brand offers some hotels of questionable luxury but this locaton rivals The Four Seasons which, for me, is the best.The room decor and service were impecable. Standard rooms come with flat screen television and very comfortable comtemporary furniture. The suite are large and with large tv's in the master suites and a control panel at bedside.The American breakfasts are sumptous. The service is excellent.Even the doorman will take special care to direct the taxi driver to tthe exact location to wish you wish to travel. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good location I stayed for 3 nights in early Dec 2007 at the Hilton. It is located near the French Concession area. As expected of a business hotel, it was clean and efficient. The staff were courteous, helpful and spoke English. "
hilton shanghai ,"Not as bad as some reviews I was a little apprehensive about booking at the Shanghai Hilton after reading some of the reviews here but my stay was pretty nice. I booked two Pointstretcher Award rooms for six nights over Christmas. I arranged for an airport pickup from the hotel at PVG and we were transported very comfortably in a minivan. We were met on arrival by an Assistant Manager and escorted to the VIP check-in area. We were upgraded to adjoining rooms on the Executive Floor and these were the refurbished rooms with Plasma TVs and very comfortable beds. The bathroom was a little on the small side but modern with marble countertops. The shower was in the bathtub with both a hand shower and an overhead showerhead. The shower curtain, however, did not do a very good job and there was always a puddle on the floor after each shower. My only other complaint was that there were not enough drawers for our clothes. Other than those minor inconveniences, the room was very nice. The room attendants were excellent and our rooms were always made up and cleaned by the time we finished breakfast every morning. We were comped breakfast at the Executive Lounge on the 39th Floor and the food selection was more than adequate although the Dim Sum was usually far from hot. There were also eggs cooked to order. The location was very good and within walking distance to the shops on Huaihai Road and Xintiandi although I would advise taking a very inexpensive taxi ride. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and courteous. The only major complaint I had was the buffet at the cafe on the ground floor. It was, by far, the worst buffet I have ever had at a major hotel in Asia. They had themed nights for the buffet and we ate on a Sunday night which was International night. The selections were scarce and the quality of the food was poor. Whatever I was served at the carving station didn't qualified as meat and the sushi were not fresh. Anyway, that was my only real complaint about the hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. "
hilton shanghai ,"Expensive This is one of the most expensive hotels I've stayed at in China. Although the service is excellent the rooms are pretty worn out and are comparable to a standard hotel costing a lot less. The food was poor plus you even get charged for breakfast. Its unpleasent or anything, just tired and extremely expensive. "
hilton shanghai ,"Overall a very nice stay. My stay there was on November 27 and 28, 2007.Having been to Shanghai several times, I've always liked the French Concession. Last time (September) I stayed at the Westin in the Bund. While the hotel was nice enough, it felt as if were being nickeled and dimeed to death and the charges for things like bottled water, a restaurant snack, etcetera, were exorbitant. And, while many of the staff were nice enough, there were several seemed a bit arrogant in terms of attitude.The Hilton is in the French Concession. It's a nice place to walk and meander about yet convenient to much of Shanghai. The greeting we received was warm and welcoming and we were sent off the the Hilton Honors desk to check in. We were helped by an extremely professional woman named Willa and she indicated that both rooms had been upgraded. Upon arriving at the rooms, we found a box of chocolates, a basket of fruit and bottled water to welcome us.The rooms we stayed in were neat, clean, and in fine condition although a few years old in terms of decor. Despite that, we had no complaints. We also noticed that renovations/modifications were under way. The beds were nicely appointed and very comfortable--that counts for a lot!Complimentary breakfast was served on the 39th floor (they were renovating one of the usual breakfast locations. Selection was reasonable, although one morning the staff was slow to replenish the food in the chafing dishes.I needed to use the business center for some posters and color copying. There were a few language challenges (I have yet to find a Chinese hotel where there aren't!) but the staff were eager to please.The cafe off the lobby offers a great menu selection with choices to please a traveler from just about any part of the world. They also have themed nights in the restaurant. We took some guests to he dinner buffet and they were very happy with the food and the selection.All in all, the stay there was great. It has the feel and friendliness of a smaller property with the amenities and service that the better managed Hilton properties offer. I'd highly recommend it and will return there again. "
hilton shanghai ,"Getting a little tired but still nice Very nice, efficient, but anonymous business hotel. The food quality was fantastic. Room was looking a bit tired and could use renovating - for example, peeling paper in bathroom with mold behind... Very good service as with most top hotels in China. "
hilton shanghai ,"Very good service Because I generally stay at Hiltons when I can (I'm a Diamond, or top-level member), I didn't read the Trip Advisor reviews before booking (or staying) at this hotel. The reviews seem really mixed, and after staying at this property, I can understand why (though I believe, on average, that it's a pretty good hotel). The staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous, and the newly redecorated rooms are very attractive and comfortable (though I don't believe the furnishings, etc., are of the highest quality). All of my restaurant meals were from room service, which was perfectly fine and beautifully served. I thought the location was fine, as well, with good (inexpensive) taxis readily available and a metro station relatively nearby (I walked the 10-15 minutes to the location where I was conducting business). In all, I thought the hotel was a bit pricey, but the service was good, and the room was fine (it will be interesting to see the business floor lounge, when it eventually reopens). One odd thing still bothers me, however -- and maybe it's simply my inexperience with traveling in extremely humid climates. On the day that I checked out (after having stayed there for several days), I was surprised to see a cockroach walking around by the telephone. I know that roaches appear from time to time, but I don't recall seeing one in a hotel for a very long time, and I've never seen one before at a Hilton. I realize that by reporting this here, I may discourage some future guest from staying at this hotel. To be clear, I will stay here again -- without hesitation. However, I do find this a bit odd. In all (other than my little &quot;room mate&quot;) , this is a fine hotel, and I would encourage anyone to consider staying here if the location and price were appropriate for your needs. "
hilton shanghai ,"Much improved great stay My agent booked me at the Hilton for one night, and despite the negative reviews here I decided to stay on my way through Shanghai. I was very pleasantly surprised by the experience. The room was freshly remodeled in a very modern style and the staff was consistently friendly and helpful. Room service food was good, and the view from the top-floor lounge was nice. "
hilton shanghai ,"High Standards at the Hilton Spent three nights at the Shanghai Hilton on business.This is a towering skyscraper of a hotel, reasonably well placed for business in this sprawling city.As previous posts have indicated, it does look a little dated, and the bedrooms could possibly benefit from an update. That said, it is nevertheless an international hotel of high quality, with all the amenities you could wish for during a business stay.The bedroom was comfortable, if a little old fashioned. The bathroom was very good indeed, with a huge bath and marble fittings.The conference facilities are very good indeed. There is wifi in all public areas, but unfortunately not free. There are a number of restaurants, both Chinese and western, and all are of high quality. There is a pleasant bar at the top of the hotel, with spectacular views of the city. Lounge areas on the ground flood are very comfortable, with regular live musical entertainment from very good artists.Staff throughout the hotel are delightful and very anxious to please.This is a very good hotel of international standard. It is deservedly five star, despite the need for updating. "
hilton shanghai ,"Quality has gone down Seems as if the quality of this hotel is slipping. I stayed in a newly renovated executive floor room. I was upgraded for free. Ok, nice, but now I wish that they had left me in a &quot;regular&quot; room. These new rooms are poorly planned and badly maintained. Outlets are sparce and in inconvenient locations. No outlets near the bedstands, for example. No ironing board or iron in the room. Maybe they think that people staying in these rooms never iron their own clothes after a flight. I do. So, I had to call for an iron and ironing board to be brought up. What a mess! Very poor quality board, low, and the iron itself leaked. Ok. What could happen next. Well next up is the desk lamp, which has a special plug for a special outlet. It is so special, that it will not stay plugged in securely, and the lamp flickers whenever I move my chair. The lamp itself will not stay adjusted to illuminate the entire desk, because no one maintains the adjustment. So, it just sadly droops to the side and illuminates just the inside section of the large glass (yes glass!) desk...The bathroom has a very modern &quot;artsy&quot; decor, but it is just barely functional. There is no separate shower stall. For a room that costs this much (2150 RMB, my company's special rate), one would think that they might have that. I think that I must be spoiled from staying at the Shangri-La in Pudong (same price, but much nicer room and bathroom, AND everything works!).Well, I have stayed in this Hilton at least 3 to 4 times per year over the past 4 years. I have never seen a room like this in this particular Hilton property. Oh well...this is just my first night. Perhaps it will get better later in the week. "
hilton shanghai ,"Very good The Hilton Shanghai is well located, the rooms are everything you would expect from a Hilton. I booked a standard King and thought it was a very good room, high quality bed and bedding, nice bathroom. Staff was great. Laundry and business center are ridiculously overpriced, but other than that, no complaints at all. "
hilton shanghai ,"Great if you want a massage in your room I stayed here three nights. On the first night I walk into the elevator, and was joined, from nowhere by a girl who didn't press any floor buttons. Weird. On my final night, same thing, another girl except this time &quot;hi.... Like massage?... very nice...: I said no thanks but she persisted in following me to my room, and I had to shut the door in her face.Otherwise this place is shabby and tired, and needs a visit from a wrecking ball. "
hilton shanghai ,"Stay away at least for now Currently staying at this hotel I can only strongly advise you to stay elsewhere. I have stayed in many of the other premium hotels in the city and chose the Hilton this time to see what it was like. Being a Gold VIP member I made an online reservation including airport transfer and reconfirmed this with another email directly to the hotel. The greeter at arrivals at the airport did not have my reservation and was not helpful at all. Even when I called the hotel I got the uninterested advise to just take a taxi.Arrival is a pretty crammed affair, nothing nice about it although valet was very present. The lobby is nice enough but the check-in behind the counter looks very old and worn. Reservation details were wrong, hard to understand when it was made electronically. Service was friendly even when telling me that the Executive Lounge was closed for renovations.My &quot;Deluxe&quot; room 2121 was anything but deluxe and simply bad. Already had a musty smell when I entered and the room interior is simply unacceptable at a price where one can stay at 10 other premium hotels for the same or less and get a MUCH better product. It was seriously not much better than a Motel 6. On the positive side it was clean and the bed was comfortable but that was about it. Cheap tacky decor which was well worn and should have been replaced years ago. As I am writing this on the scratched desk I am looking at the wheel and base of the bed and listening to construction noise above and annoying whistling sounds from my bay window. I called to change rooms but apparently they are all the same with the possible exception of the suites. Rather than paying extra in this 2-3 start hotel I will try to check out early and find a better place.Hilton Shanghai? Defnitely not again for me! "
hilton shanghai ,"Exemplary hotel and good service The amount of brown marble in the Hilton lobby gives a vaguely dated impression, but this is offset by the quality of the rooms, a convenient location and the service.The reason I am writing this review is more related to the service. The concierge in Shanghai was exceptional. I had a number of requests and all the staff were English speaking and exceptionally helpful. In a country where it is sometimes difficult to make yourself understood (even with a rudimetary grasp of Mandarin) this makes all the difference. If I return to Shanghai I would stay here again. "
hilton shanghai ,"A very good option for different kinds of travelers I selected this hotel primarily because it was a Hilton hotel. This is the 3rd hotel I have utilized in Shanghai (one more expensive and another cheaper) and I would rank it as quite good.The hotel largely has the feel and features of a business hotel. It is priced accordingly in terms of the cost of items in the bar, the hotel restaurants, business services, room rates, and so on. The hotel is very Western, but I guess this is not surprising given that it is a Hilton hotel.The hotel has a good business services office. I used both Internet and printing services, though, as noted, the services can be expensive. The staff at the hotel also were very professional and conversed easily in English. I used the concierge staff to make train reservations and they were quite helpful. The housekeeper did any excellent job keeping my room in good shape and observing my living patterns (e.g., she regularly refilled the hot water pot since I was using it). On a related note, I raised some issues with the hotel manager and I quickly got a response and even a visit from management upon my departure.The hotel is not that far from the subway and is well served by taxis. Across from the hotel, there are a number of restaurants and bars. Some of these restaurants have English language menus and some Western style breakfast options. If you speak any Mandarin, then I would encourage you to voyage to some of the restaurants in a 2-3 block radius of the hotel. There is 1 historical site of some note near the hotel as well as 1 large shopping complex.My room, which was on the 14th floor, offered a decent view. It was spacious and well equipped. My only complaint about my room was that the desk/chair set up was not appropriate for those doing a lot of computer work. I was told the hotel was going to remodel some rooms.While I primarily recommend this hotel for business travelers, I think it is good for tourists and others needing a versatile and well run hotel. "
hilton shanghai ,"Nice place in Shanghai Hilton Shanghai is a comfortable place to stay for 1 night in a double room I've paid about 1300 rmb.When you arrive at Pudong Airport you can easily go to one of the hoteldesks, Chinese are selling rooms at almost every hotel.Its certainly worth asking several desks ( price vary ! ).When you made your choice at one of the desks the staff will show you several hotels. As a foreigner just pick a wellknown hotel like Hilton, Howard Johnsson, Okura etc.The staff will offer you a price, just go and negotiate and you will save at least 300 rmb! And sometimes a free taxi to your Hotel.Ok, let's get back to the Hilton;Check-in goes fast altough there are lots of guests, porters assist you at all times with your luggage.The rooms are large and have big windows and nice views.Rooms are equipt with Wifi, 2 large chairs, 2 telephones, minibar en a good clean bathroom with ammenities. The beds are large and sleep soft!The room is equipt with a good guestdirectory wich offers you information about the Hotel and Shanghai's hotspots.A plus for me is the variety of people staying in the Hilton, in some Shanghai hotel's your staying with only businessman.Overhere are students, tourists, businessman and Chinese so contact in for example the bar is easily made!The restaurants are nice and provide good healthy food, also the roomservice menu is large and offers very good choices like;Jetlagmenus, American Cuisine, French Cuisine etc.Lots of taxis in front of the hotel and one big plus; everyone citizen know's the Hilton! So you cant get lost.Overall; good value for money, nice clean and save place to stay, relatively nearby all big Shanghai Hotspots! "
hilton shanghai ,"Stay iin Shang all the time stay at a old Astor Hotel on my trips to Shang - 4 a year, had a flight d/x'd and Hilton came though quickly to get me a room - great room, and great staff. If you do not know Shanghia, then go safe, this is a solid place to stay "
hilton shanghai ,"Incredible Service The service was outstanding, and the concierge service was incredible. They were very helpful, the recommendations were always great, and their directions to the taxis were always spot on (important when the taxi drivers don't speak English). The rooms were like typical Hilton rooms. Nice, but nothing incredible nor creatively decorated. The room was very comfortable and clean. Room service was great. It was actually cheaper to order breakfast room service vs eating at the buffet. Go figure. Room service, minibar and internet service made it an easy place to get work done while on the road. The workout room was really nice. Lots of cardio equipment and weight machines. The hotel is not on the Bund, but it was still really easy to get there. Just a cheap taxi ride away. The Hilton location was a little easier for business, because we didn't have to deal with the Bund congestion. Next time I'll probably stay on the Bund just to see what I might be missing. Overall though I was very happy with this hotel. "
hilton shanghai ,"Ok but rooms could do with a face lift Stayed here for 8 night from 5th May. The hotel is located about a 5 minute walk from the subway line 2 stop &quot;Jing an temple&quot;. From here it is 3 stops into the main shopping area of Nanjing road (or 2 stops, if you want the upmarket shopping, or where the fakes are at 580 Najing Road W or a short taxi ride)From Pudong, taxi takes about 50-60minutes (non peak hour) and should cost Rmb150.Hotel was ok, but I have stayed in Hiltons which are better.Positives: good location, generally friendly staff, large bed, great bathroom amenities (from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn).Negatives: Aside from Saturday morning, I had to queue every day for the breakfast. though it went reasonably fast, It still takes a good 5-10 minutes before you are seated. Rooms as mentioned above are a bit out dated, TV was old and did not work that well, bathroom is small, hairdryer is the old style and if your neighbours speak loud / tv loud, you will hear it in your room.With that said above, all the negatives are minor, and I would stay here again due to location and the fact I can walk to my companies office and avoid the nightmare of peak hour traffic jams. "
hilton shanghai ,"Good Value during Labor Day Holiday My third stay in this hotel. The entire hotel is little bit dated butwell maintained. Room is clean and very good service.Breakfast is chaotic because so many people (breakfast is till 10:30AM). Waited 10 minutes for a table on the 3rd day. But waiters/waitress, captains, managers were trying to do their best. Reason there are so many people staying in Hilton is they have a special price of RMB678 (each day) which is abt US$87 for local Chinese including breakfast for two during the Labor Day Golden Week Holiday. My price is US$295 per person including Dragon Air Hong Kong to Shanghai return and 3 nights in Hilton(on twin share basis) with daily breakfast. So it is a good deal "
hilton shanghai ,"Historic Hilton If your looking for a bit of a history then this may be the place for you. Friends in Shanghai tell me this is one of the first five star hotels in Shanghai and looks like not much has changed since it was originally built. The rooms are dated, bathrooms pokey and the walls paper thin- was able to hear conversations and TV next door (without a glass to the wall) which disturbed sleep. For a supposed 5 star hotel , at approx. US$230 per night, expected more.In its favour it does have a good location and the top floor bar is fantastic. If looking for a 5 star hotel in Shanghai I would first look at Shangri La or Hyatt. "
hilton shanghai ,"Great Hotel Great hotel, nice big spacious rooms, very clean. Staff were very friendly and the bar at the top has a fantastic view and serves great drinks. Definately reccomend it, its also really close to the markets for the shopping! "
hilton shanghai ,"Great Hotel Great hotel, great location...I have stayed here for the past 6 years and love coming back. The staff are friendly and very helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them.Rooms are okay and could do with some upgrading but overall cleanliness and standard of the hotel is fantastic. Food in the main atrium restauant is superb and although a bit expensive it is definately worth the experience. Stay here with confidence !! "
hilton shanghai ,"Fantastic Hilton! My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Shanghai in early November 2006 and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.We had come to Shanghai from Hong Kong where we stayed in the Conrad, which was awesome, so the Hilton had a lot to live up to, which it did. As it was our anniversary, I had arranged a bouquet of flowers to be in the room upon our arrival. When we checked in, a lady came rushing over to us from guest relations explaining that the flowers were in the room and we were presented with complimentary breakfast vouchers and ones for the spa, too.The room we had was very spacious, had a lovely corner window which looked out over the rooftops of the local neighborhood. The bouquet of the sweetest smelling flowers was in the room and they had even thrown some petals over the bedspread which was very lovely. The bathroom was clean and very spacious, too. The best bit about the hotel however is the spa. Located on the 4th floor, you have to go there when you are there. There's quite a good gym with lots of modern equipment, a very good pool and a fantastic sauna/jacuzzi/steam room set up, which we seemed to use quite a bit; having walked the streets of Shanghai most days, we were in need of a good foot soak. We also booked in for a spa special massage which involved quite a hefty massage and facial. Lovely.The exec floor lounge was good too. Every evening from 5-8 we were invited to go for drinks and snacks and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The only comment I would have to make is that it is a small lounge and therefore does get full quickly, mostly by American business guys, some of whom can get quite loud. ;o)Every morning we had breakfast in the lobby area, which was kind of weird to begin with but quaint nonetheless. Service was impeccable, so that counted for a lot.In all, a great hotel if you are visiting Shanghai. We were there on vacation, as always, we did local things, such as walked to the subway (Jiang Temple - around 5 mins walk) and got a taxi and Maglev back to Pudong airport. It all added to the experience, which was a fantastic one all in all. "
hilton shanghai ,"Awesome Hilton Recently, my partner and I had the great pleasure of staying at the Shanghai Hilton.Upon our arrival at the airport, there was a very comfortable and clean car awaiting us with a very courteous driver,who although he spoke limited English was very helpful .Upon arrival we were shown to a large room with a great view on the 29th floor. The bathroom was very clean and we found a bootle of champagne and abowl of fruit and some chocolates awaiting us.The room-service staff were extremely courteous as were the Bar staff and the Housekeeping personnel. The Penthouse Bar became a regular final drinks stop.The Restaurant , also on the top floor was excellent and the food sumptuous.Breakfast in The Atrium was excellent and after the first day, the staff remembered how we liked our tea and coffe and brought it straight away. The concierge and food and beveridge staff were extremely helpful with names of other places to eat and drink plus great pieces of advice on out of the way places to see.Having stayed in sveral other Hilton Hotels, we would have to rate this as one of their best. "
hilton shanghai ,"Loved the Hilton My husband &amp; I stayed at the Hilton Shanghai for 3 days Sept 10-12th. We were HH Gold, and were given an executive floor room on the 35th floor with a fabulous view of the Bund. It was our anniversary and the staff had wine, fruit &amp; chocolates waiting on us.We found the room to be larger than expected (we were expecting the tiny room that we find in most major cities). The maid service was outstanding. Our room was always cleaned with in 30 min of hanging the sign from the door handle.We used the gym and spa, and found it to be better than adequate. Steam room/jaccuzzi was amazing after our 15 hour flight! Our breakfast on the executive floor was wonderful. Service was outstanding and food was excellent. I can not say enough great things about the executive staff! I realize that the breakfast buffett in the Atrium area was very highly priced...but aren't they all, especially in big cities?? I'm sure the concierage can offer other great b-fast suggestions - or when in doubt there are at least 4 Starbucks w/in walking distance.The highlight of our trip was the concierage. He was so helpful to us, in every way imaginable. He wrote taxi destinations for us at least 3x each day, and was great at making suggestions for tours and dinners. Truly outstanding service.Just a note: in speaking with one of the executive floor staff members, it was mentioned that all of the rooms were going to be re-done in the next year. For those who had less impressive rooms than ours, it appears that this will change, soon!One thing caught our attention - when ever we asked for directions, all staff members told us to take a taxi - that very few things were walkable. We found this odd, b/c we walked to many destinations (Temple, People's Square area, etc). We felt that either people don't do long walks in China OR that the staff was afraid that we'd get lost.... our advice..find a map and start exploring!!Try the Massage Parlor around the corner ($7 USD for a full hour massage!). We also LOVED M on the Bund, the International Pearl Market, Yu Garden, &amp; 1221 Restaurant.All in all, wonderful Hilton that met our expectations and Hilton standards. Great location in a great city. We would stay there again. "

holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Clean and comfortable The Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai isn't really downtown. Okay, it's very close to Shanghai Station, there is easy access to the subway and the bus stop for Pudong Airport is right behind the hotel - but it is not really where you want to be if you are interested in shopping or entertainment. On the other hand, the doormen are always ready to hail a taxi and to explain to the driver where you want to go. The hotel is well up to the Holiday Inn standard, with a pleasant lobby bar. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The orange juice in the minibar can be recommended. I have stayed at the hotel on each of my half dozen visits to Shanghai and I have never been disappointed. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Perfect Nice Hotel, very clean, wonderful service and a good located for business &amp; private travellers. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Handy for the station This Holiday Inn is perfect if you need to be near the massive chaotic railway station. I arrived by train after a 20 hour overnight journey from Hong Kong and it was a huge relief to just exit the station and look up and see the hotel sign directly in front of you.True it's a little out of the centre but there is a main subway stop at the station along with a number of fast food restaurants and supermarkets. My room in the Great Wall wing was a good size with a very comfortable king sized bed. It had a kettle with tea/coffee, safe for valuables, bath tub, minibar, dressing gowns, aircon, internet access, large tv with some English channels etc - pretty much everything you need for a relaxing stay. The spacious foyer bar is a pleasant place to sit, there is also a coffee bar and basement sports bar. The reception staff are a little frosty, but this tends to be common throughout China. The chambermaid staff are a little more friendly.All in all it may not be the smartest area in town, but I would recommend staying here. It would be cheaper than staying on the Bund and you have good transport connections. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Outstanding service CLEAN good breakfast solid internet When the taxi dropped us off in front of a &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; we looked at each other and rolled our eyes. A Holiday Inn in the us is typically middle of the road, and not what we expected for our business trip in Shanghai.The fist night, we had nice, non-smoking rooms. Much cleaner than the other hotels I have experienced in China. Many of even the top end hotels seem &quot;dirty&quot; here.The internet was 60RMB add on (~$US10) which kinda bummed me, but the internet here has been the most solid and fast of any on our trip. Well worth what you would pay for 1 hour of access in a US airport!The breakfast (50RMB ~$US7.50 add on) was wonderful for a weary American: Made to order omelet , french toast, great bacon, along with fruits, breads and the odd (to Americans) assortment of food that passes for breakfast in China.We were to take the train, and it is a bit of a walk from the Holiday Inn to the train station. They are next door to each other, but across a wide and very crowded plaza. The trains station is not set up for foreigners, so there were not many english signs in the trains station. The very nice, tall (6'5&quot;) english speaking concierge &quot;Miller Zhang&quot; lugged our two huge rolling suitcases across the plaza for us, got us through security and instructed the gate agent to call us when our train came. We had agreed to pay him 50 RMB ~$US7.50 and he was very happy to help us with the task.Then there was a problem with the train. The adventure begins. Miller had left, since we had a good wait before we were supposed to leave on the train, so we lugged our bags back to the hotel. We were able to get two new non-smoking rooms on the spot for the same rate as when we reserved. These rooms are in the remodeled section of the hotel and are very nice as well as clean.I connected to the internet to book tickets for a flight to replace the train trip, but the web sites needed 24 hours advance. So again Miller Zhang came to our rescue. In a few short moments, he had us booked on China Eastern, business class. Miller delivered the tickets to our room line 1 hour later.This exceptional service makes this hotel my instant favorite hotel in China! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Average Hotel The food at the hotel has been pretty much average. Customer services were average too but some of the personnels can be quite rude to just stop and stare at you from top to toe if they happen to walk past you somewhere in the hotel. I guess this is a cultural thing because I experienced it everywhere. But provided that American is running this hotel, I think the service standard needs further improvement. I would recommend friends to go to this hotel as long as they are budget travellers. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Lovely hotel Stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China. Lovely hotel, great buffet breakfast and dinner. Spacious rooms. Internet available in rooms for a fee. It is located outside city centre but as we were on a tour and picked up by coach to go everywhere this was not a problem. Reception staff were a bit unfriendly. Be careful with their ATM machine as it 'ate' our bank card but we did get it back later in the day. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,Don't stay here. The lobby was nice but the room was a little old and the a/c barely worked. Th carpet was old with the old fashioned haridryers that barely worked. We had to leave the key in the wall so the a/c would stay on because it took 24 hours to cool off. So we didn't let them clean the room so it would stay cool. The breakfast was great but didn't start till 6:30 am. We had to leave the hotel at 6 AM to fly out so they gave us a crappy bag of a few items. What hotel starts breakfast so late when the airport wants you there 3 hours before a flight? 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great option next to the Railway Station! This hotel is a great option if you want to be close to the main Railway Station. My wife and I were traveling by train and had a lot of luggage. It only took us 7 minutes walking from the front door of the hotel to the main entrance of the station. The hotel itself is typical of Holiday Inn China standards -- which is quite good. The front desk was helpful, the room was clean, and they happily accommodated our late check-out. Just a warning, this hotel has 2 wings that aren't exactly close to each other. The hotel has a full-time golf cart that shuttles people between the wings (probably a two minute ride). Not a huge deal, but I could how some people might be annoyed by that (if they wanted to eat at the Western buffet, for example, and had to cart over to the other building to do so).Overall, highly recommended if you're planning to use the Rail Station. It's quite, clean, and the service was good. If I wasn't using the Rail Station, however, there are probably better areas of town to stay. My 5 star rating for location is based on its proximity to the Rail Station. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,Very nice refurbished rooms (if you get one) *Good*Nice refurbished rooms - non refurbished rooms are okGood serviceSpoke very good English and willing to give travel adviceNice breakfast - slightly limitedQuietVery good location (about 1-2 mins walk to metro)*Bad*Had to argue with staff when we had a problem with rooms (This was not the hotels fault we have to move but other guests. I do think they could have dealt with the problem better but in the end we were upgraded to the suite).Non refurbished rooms not as nice but still ok 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,clean easy access to tourist attraction by subway stayed for 3 nights. accessiblity from airport: From Pudong airport shuttle bus line 5 take you to hotel. hotel located 3 minues on foot from Shanghai railway station(south). but it takes long. due to traffic it took about 1.5 hr. terrible. From Hongqiao airport (old airport) it take about 30 min by taxi. about 50RMB. and it worth it.Hotel staff-service is good.Room: very clean. up to standardBreakfast: good. recommend this hotel for tourist and business traveller aswell. 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great location Excellent location, next to Shanghai Railway station and metro stop, Kerry department store, KFC, medicine shop etc. Good airconditioning, and helpful staff. Decent breakfast with choice of three kinds of coffee. Room had jasmine tea, coffee, sugar, coffeemate, but no sugar-substitute like Equal. Toiletteries were decent but there was no moisturiser. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,Convenient Location and Very Friendly Hotel Staff Taxis and train station very conveneient. Pizza Hut on back side of the hotel. Breakfast was unbelieveable on the second floor overlooking the city. A lot of staff ready to get whatever you needed. Chef ready to make any kind of omlet. Chinese breakfast with western too. It was fantastic! The coffee beans were ground when you selected your coffee. Conceirge was very helpful. Made suggestions that were in our best interest and not the hotel since prices might be more expensive. We had one early morning train to catch for an excursion and the hotel prepared a box breakfast for us and had it ready when we needed it. Staff always smiling and willing to please. 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Just OK good location near train station. This hotel was just ok. Stayed at the GREAT WALL WING, which they advertised as the &quot;newer&quot; wing. The room is clean and modern, but is too small! The hotel is right at the main street, so you can definitely hear the traffic outside, even at night! A/C was not good also. We asked for a new room because of this, but they gave us a small electric fan instead since they said the A/C was centralized and the temp is the same in all rooms.What attracted us though to this hotel is the low rate the Priority Club website gave us, and its proximity to the Shanghai Railway Station. We just walked behind the hotel to catch the early train to Zhenjiang.Will I go back again? Hmm....maybe not. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"I wish that service would be as good as location Firstly, I have to say that it was so far the only disappointing experience with Holiday Inn hotels in China.The hotel is located just across the square of the main train station. It has two wings, which both can be accessed if you walk around the house (if coming from the train station). The streets around the hotel during the night are popular among homeless, who sleep on the street. Also, at one point an awful smell from the sewage system is coming up.On our arrival, my upgrade had not been processed (being a PC Platinum) and had to be asked. It took ages to check in as they had to manually fill in long forms regarding our visa and passport details. After getting upgrade to Priority Club floor, I still had to ask all the details regarding the benefits - compared that usually they explain me those without asking (based on HI experience in China).Got the room on 15th floor (dedicated Club Floor for PC Plats). The room was very small, I had problem getting the two medium-sized suitcases in it. There is also no wardrobe, just a metal line with hangers next to door. The windows - they were double windows and so so dirty and small that in the morning looking out I thought it was raining out there, even though there was sunshine. The beds were also rock-hard.Good side was that 6 free soft drinks were allowed daily from mini-bar.About the Club lounge - quite small. And only tables for 2. But we were family of 3, so one of us had to sit on a separate table. The selection for breakfast was quite poor - at 9am the cheese and fish were already finished, I grabbed the last yougurt and had some pancakes. Good side is that at least in the lounge there is free wireless. During the day no drinks freely available - you have to ask from the receptionist if you want to have something. Which also annoyed me was that as we were family of 3 and I was Platinum member, then it has been never ever a problem around the globe in this chain having 3 persons instead of 2 (as it was twin room), moreover when staying on club floor. This time however they wanted to charge extra for that lousy breakfast for that 3rd family member. After a long conversation they agreed me at least.Oh, and we as any other guest in the hotel were also given vouchers for welcome drink in the bar. Well, I went for juice. They had just orange option available, all others had run out.All in all - later when staying in Shanghai Holiday Inn Pudong, the experience for the same price was way more better, like 5*-s. I suggest you to stay in this hotel only if you have to stay next to train station, otherwise you can get a way better hotels for the same money in this town. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,Comfortable The highlight of the stay was the foot massage at the hotel. We were a part of a large group and spent most of the time out sightseeing but it was a comfortable stay. Simple and clean and no frills and fanciness. 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Perfectly adequate and charmless Great location; great price (560 RMB all tax plus two breakfasts included, deluxe queen bed, 10th floor ), small but physically complete room, very clean, non-smoking, very comfortable bed, all the trimmings (toiletries, robes, towels, hot water, flat TV, tub, hair dryer etc). Great Wall wing, no smells, one of the refurbished rooms I think, excellent lighting for reading or work in room. Quiet heating/ventilation.Oddity: glass floor-to-ceiling wall between bathroom and bed; OK, it could be blocked (mostly) with venetian blind, but really unnecessary. Maybe we got the unadvertised fetish room.Buffet breakfast excellent, plenteous, excellent staff. Lots of food and service even though we arrived near the end of the breakfast period. Well done, HI.BUT, a room with so little charm or magnetism! Certainly not what is expected of a four-star rating. Partly due to poor small cell-like windows.When cracked open at all, continuous noise from the PA lady at the train station. Fortunately, the noise was well blocked when the windows were closed. No view to speak of; mostly the rear of advertising sign. Dirty windows. Corridor sounds entered room easily.Summary: excellent for the main purposes of convenience, sleeping and rest; much less than interesting in any other way. Maybe a high-level 3-star place. Good prices on website. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Not bad - doesn't have pool We just recently stayed in the Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai (Great Wall Section). We wanted three things...1) A comfortable bed.2) A bedroom seperate from the living room.3) A nice swimming pool.We got 2 out of 3.ProsStayed in the Executive Suite which was costly but very nice.Concierge was very knowledgable, helpful and friendly.Breakfasts were pretty good.Door attendants were exceptionally helpful and should be given a pay rise.ConsNo swimming pool.Location was okay, but you have to catch taxis everywhere. We were hoping it was a little closer to everything. Check out was a pain in the backside. Allow extra time when checking out, as you need to go over their bill carefully. We are both University educated people and we couldn't understand the bill. To this day we are unsure if we were charged the correct amount. Many at the checkout counter were having similar difficulties.General staff are not very helpful or very friendly especially in the restaurants.We had trouble with the Internet and had to pack up all our belongings on the second day. This was a major inconvenience and took some time. The new room had no view.We ordered room service one night and the meals were lukewarm/cold-ish. For AU$100 this was pretty disappointing. The staff don't speak English very well. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Good hotel near train station We stayed in this hotel because it was across the street from the train station. We were on our way to Beijing via train and needed a place to stay for one night in Shanghai. The location is great for that purpose. The train station is far from the touristy spots in Shanghai, so it's really not downtown as the hotel name suggests, but the Metro can get you mostly anywhere you need to go. From the Pudong airport, the hotel can be accessed by the Metro because it's across the street from the train station. After taking the really neat Maglev train (peak speed of 430 km/hr, 8 minute ride), you have to take the Line 2 (Longyan stop) and change at People's Square stop to Line 1 (Shanghai Train Station stop) to get to the train station. With the Metro stations in Shanghai, there are numerous exits that are numbered, so you have to look at a map to figure out which exit number you should take in order to exit the subway at the closest spot to your destination. Changing lines at People's Square can be overwhelming because of the sheer number of people that transfer lines here. Not only are there a lot people transferring, but there are lot people on the subway trains itself. There are also a lot of stairs, too. If you have a lot of luggage, it may be better to take a taxi from the Maglev stop to the train station directly to avoid the crowds and stairs.Finding the hotel entrance can be a bit tricky. From the train station, you can see the signs for the Holiday Inn, but the entrances are located on the back sides of the buildings to which they are attached. This means you have to cross the main plaza between the two buildings to get to the backside of either building. After you've made it across the plaza, you have to walk around a long gated fence before you can even enter either entrance for the hotel. If you have a lot of luggage or it's raining, this is not a pleasant walk because there are a few stairs in the plaza and the distance to get to the actual entrance is a bit farther than anticipated. As we found out later, it's actually faster to not cross the plaza, but instead to go around the outside of the buildings to get to the entrances. The hotel has two buildings, the Great Wall wing and the Plaza wing. The Plaza wing is the older of the two buildings, and our room was there. We did not know this and checked in on the Great Wall side. I am not sure how you would find out which wing you were staying in prior to arrival, but this would have been helpful. If you are standing and facing the Holiday Inn buildings with the train station behind you, the Great Wall wing is on the left and the Plaza wing is on the right. If you check in at the wrong wing, you have to take an underground tunnel, which is actually the entrance/exit to the underground parking lot. Overall, the tunnel seemed pretty safe, but we were always a bit cautious because driving in China seems to not follow any obvious rules. You will share the underground tunnel with the incoming and outgoing cars as you cross over to the other building. We didn't know this, but since we checked in at the wrong building, we thought we would have to check out at the same place we checked in. Fortunately, you don't have to do that, and the receptionist had to walk across the underground tunnel to get our bill.The room itself was spacious. Beds in China are firmer than Western beds, but the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was decent, and overall, the room was clean. The room was also non-smoking, which is a plus. A lot of people smoke in China and the smoke can waft its way into your room. Fortunately, we did not experience that. Our room faced the the train station, and there is a lot of noise from the train station at night. There was a persistent loudspeaker all night long. I am not sure what the woman was saying, but it seemed to be a few Mandarin Chinese sentences that were repeated endlessly. It might be better and quieter to ask for a room that does not face the train station. You have to put your room key card in a slot to activate the electricity in the room. This seemed to be a common theme as we traveled throughout China. It can be a bit tricky to figure out how to turn off all the lights at night, and we just removed the card at night. I think this is how hotels are looking to conserve energy. The staff speaks decent English. They were also helpful and courteous in suggesting restaurants. We did not eat at the hotel, but had a drink there. Staff is attentive in the lobby bar. There is currency exchange at the front desk, which is also helpful. One of the most helpful things was the free luggage storage. We were catching a night train to Beijing and after checking out, they were able to store our luggage for the afternoon. The area surrounding the hotel can be a little bit seedy at night because there was a whole section of homeless people camped out in sleeping bags, but again, you are in a big city and near a train station. They did not seem to bother us at all. There are lots of fast food restaurants in this area, ranging from KFC to Japanese noodle shops. There is not a good grocery store in this area, but there is a small convenience store where you can buy bottled water, other drinks, and snacks.Overall, this hotel is great because of its location, which is across the street from the train station. It is far from any of the touristy sights in Shanghai, but you can take the Metro practically anywhere. If you are planning to spend a longer time exploring Shanghai, then I would recommend staying closer to the tourist attractions. If you just need a place to sleep on your way to your next destination via train, then this is the place to stay. Staff is courteous, attentive, and helpful. The room is clean and comfortable. For us, it was the right hotel for our purpose: spending only one night in Shanghai, so that we could catch the train to Beijing the next evening. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Very Acceptable I'd never stayed at a Holiday Inn before and was not expecting very much from the photos I'd seen on various websites.But I was very pleasantly surprised here. It's a big hotel with 2 wings and you need to make sure the taxi goes to the correct wing, otherwise you have to walk down and through the underground car park to get to the other wing which is a bit inconvenient.Very comfortable room with all amenities. Good laundry service. Very helpful staff who really try hard to assist you.Didn't try the restaurant but the lounge on the top floor was fine for breakfast and using free internet.Finally, it's very close to the railway station. I'd definitely stay there again, and it's much better than the photos suggest.. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Don't stay here I decided to book this hotel as the name is Holiday Inn so it should be a standard good hotel but it was not.First we check in around 4.30pm but the room is not finish or ready which it should not be because it's 4 pm so only 1 room is ready so we wait in the room that is ready. When we go into the room the room look nice as we book the deluxe room, all main equipment is there, room is clean, bed and pillow is comfortable. The front said they will call us when the another room is finish about 15-20 mins but there was no call so I have to call them and check and they said there is 1 room finish on the 5th floor, we say ok so we move to there, when we are there the housekeeping is still cleaning and the bed sheet is not start yet so we leave our luggage and have to up to stay in the other room that we got again...(how the front say its done) so we go out, around the hotel there is many shopping mall and also restarant, the another bad thing is this hotel has 2 building and you have to walk down to the car park underground to go to another side which many people get confused. after go out we came back to the room which sure that the room is finish but something pop up in my mind, this room doesn't look like the another room that my friend got so I know this is only the standard room and we paid for the deluxe room not standard but it's late and we want to sleep.One more terrible thing happen, the lights that is on the celing which there are on each bed can turn off only 1so that 's mean the light on my bed couldn't turn off, so i call the front and they said i have to take the key card out which mean everything will be off, can you imagine if another person want to use electricity or tv the can't because have to take the card out for the light that could not turn off, so we call the house keeping and she come to help which it's still can't turn off, she said have to fix in the morning only 1 way to turn off is take the key card out! So at night if you want to go to the bathroom and turn on the light you must put your key card first but the light on me turn on too. The hotel is near the subway but I think Red line or line no. 1 as it near the railway station there is some noise at night too. One bad thing is about the breakfast, there is not much food for you to choose and the juice taste bad. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Was not very good This hotel is clearly in need of a renovation. We did not have the new rooms. The room was oke but a little bit old. The breakfast was terrible. They did not had enough time to fill up the plates and there was not enough place to sit. The groups and individuals had breakfast all together, if you have enough room than this is no problem but here it was!If you can you better look for a better offer. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Well located Hotel I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai a couple of times now on business trips and while it is a typical Holiday Inn the staff are very helpful and the rooms are well appointed. The real benefit of this hotel is its close proximity to the railway and the metro. When I came back from one long train journey it was nice to just walk across the square to get to the hotel.One slightly strange thing about the hotel is that it is in two halves and you have to make sure that you know which one you are staying at! Also the facilities are not the same for both halves, so it is a short walk between the two buiding (situated either side of a square).Rooms are reasonably priced and they have Internet connection. The restaurant is ok but fairly standard. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"It was a Holiday Inn! We stayed at the holiday inn - downtown shanghai in may 07.It was as you would expect a holiday inn to be, no nasty surprises but nothing special either. The room that we had was a bit musty on the first night that we were there but wasn't noticable on the second night of our stay. There is a good little american bar in the oppposite wing to where we stayed. We watched the FA cup final in there and it wasn't as crowded as every other bar/ resturant that we went to in shanghai (this is a good thing). "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"A pleasant hotel in the heart of Shanghai Rooms are big and spacious with good amenities provided. Furnishing appeared to be very well-maintained. It would have been a bonus if the TV set provided is a Plasma, which is a trend amongst many Holiday Inns around the world. Hotel has good facilities, including a gymnasium. The restaurant also serves good quality food at reasonable prices.Location is excellent with the Airport Express Bus (Line 5) just a few steps away from the hotel. The railway station is also across the street from the hotel, thus providing easy access to places like Hangzhou and Suzhou. Also located at the back of the hotel is the Shanghai Railway Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, an important interchange station of the red line (Line 1), yellow line (Line 3) and the purple line (Line 4). Taking the MRT ride from this station will get you to virtually anywhere within Shanghai city.Around the hotel, you can also find numerous eating outlets. Prices are very cheap by western standards and food hygiene is good. There is also a shopping centre within 3 minutes walking distance. Imported fashion can be found inside the departmental store of this shopping centre.All in all, this is a very good hotel suitable for both the leisure and business traveller. There is no doubt that Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai is one of the most value-for-money hotel in this cosmopolitan city. :) "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Friendly Staff Good example of Holiday Inn chain. Much better than the Pudong Holiday Inn although not as modern. Great location for a stroll around and two good restaurants on site.Staff helpful and friendly, got my taxi to the Maglev at Longyang Lu no problem although needed a few hand gestures!!Only one quibble with the location, it is right next to the railway station and can get a bit noisy at night.Would stay there again. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Practical but surely you can get better hotels in Shanghai Pro:- in front of the train and underground station- decent service- all the frills (bathrobe, toothbrush, slippers,...)- fairly centralContra:- very old and used furniture and carpets (Plaza Wing)- very low ceilings- needed to ask to change the sheets as they had some stains (wich they did promptly) "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai is great! This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. I had read some bad reviews before going and was apprehensive - but there was no need to worry.The front desk staff were very helpful and dealt quickly, efficiently and pleasantly with all our queries during the week we were there. The room, on the 10th floor, was spacious, quiet and well maintained. The two restaurants and the bar were good and the breakfast choice was wide and tasty.It is right next door to the mainline station and the metro, so very accessible even if not absolutely central. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"No surprises This is the typical business hotel, not very charming or personal but a good standard and no surprises. We stayed at the Great Wall Wing, and rumors said the Plaza Wing is better. The room was small, but clean, well-equipped and with nice modern furniture. Breakfast ok, but nothing special just the standard buffet. The breakfast hall itself was a bit shabby and not very well kept after during breakfast. The location of the hotel is a bit far from the more interesting parts of the city, but taxi is cheap and subway close-by so that is not such a big problem. I would recommend it to anyone who does not want to splurge on a luxury hotel near People's square or have any bad surprises with a hotel at a more moderate price-range. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"good value for money we stayed at the holiday inn downtown plaza tower for 2 nights at the start of our tour of china. i must admit having read the reviews we were a little concerned. we had a perfectly adaquate room on a high floor and had the windows been cleaned we would have had a great view.the bed was very hard but the bedding was very comfortable and clean.the bathroom was ok pretty good shower and plenty of cosmetics, very handy when your touring.the best bit though was the breakfast it was excellant the choice was extensive. all in all not bad value for money you pay. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Should be a traveler's last resort even than not recommended!! Our 3 night stay at this hotel was booked by Isram Tours, and sold to us as a 4 star property. We did not read any of the reviews prior to travel, I wish we had as our experience was worse than most of the reviews we read upon our return.The check-in was acceptable, the hotel &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a 10th floor room, nonsmoking as requested. The moment we exited the elevator the carpets had the most unbearable putrid mildew smell. The room was even worse, the mildew affected my sinuses in minutes. I called the front desk to tell them I cannot breathe, we need a room change, instead housekeeping came with more chemicals that they sprayed in our presence without consulting us. My breathing became worse, finally the manager offered us another room on the 6th floor. We did not even exit the elevator, the tabacco smoke smell was so unbearablystrong. Hard to believe, while I am unable to breathe, the hotel offers us another mildew infested smoking room! According to the manager on duty, the hotel had not cleaned its carpets in 20 years, they had a cleaning scheduled for 2008!! At this point, because we were ready to leave and find another hotel, the manager offers us a lovely clean room in the renovated Plaza Tower, a 3 minute walk thru the underground garage. The room on a high floor, was clean, renovated, fresh smelling, as per our initial expectations. When we refused to pay a high $$$ upgrade fee, or move back to the infested tower, we were offered a 2nd and LAST option room in the renovated tower, on the smoking floor. The hotel manager was aware that we do not smoke and aware of my respiratory problems caused by the chemicals sprayed when we arrived, but becausewe were on a prepaid hotel voucher, he said he should not even be offering us a room in the renovated tower. At that moment I was equally angry with our tour operator as with the manner the hotel staff was treating us.Between the 2 evils, we accepted the renovated smoking room on the 4th floor with a lovely roof view, next to the elevator. Overall opinion - I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Either towers. The hotel is mildew infested, the staff treats tourists traveling with prepaid hotel vouchers as 3rd class citizens. During our entire stay, we were reminded by the front desk staff that at the price paid, we should be almost grateful they gave us a room !! With that attitude, I cannot think of a positive feature about the hotel. Both hotel towers are close to the train station, at night theside streets are full of homeless people sleeping in store entrances.There are no established restaurants in the hotel vicinity, only inexpensive eateries, no attractions, a mediocre mall across the street, overall the hotel should be no more than a high 2 star property or a low 3 star property. There are better hotels close to Nanjing Road for the same rate. I will never leave home again without first checking tripavisor reports. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"convenient slightly above average hotel The rooms are clean and comfortable. There's a shuttle bus service, no 5 (bus fare: RMB18 ) from Pudong Airport to the hotel, which save me a lot of money. The journey to the hotel is about 1 hour, slightly long but its worth the journey. Lots of shopping malls located within walking distance from the Hotel. I would stay in this hotel again for my next trip "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great place to stay I stayed at this hotel (Great Wall Wing) for 3 nights in May. The hotel was chosen for it's close proximity to the railway station (2 minutes walk) and highway (run past the hotel) links due to many meetings being planned out of Shanghai.The rooms are the normal size you would expect from Holiday Inn, with TV, fully fitted bathroom with shower over the bath. We asked for and received queen size beds in our rooms. After a 12 hour working day in temperatures of 25-30 degrees, the beds proved very comfortable.The staff keep the rooms imaculate each day and are always helpful and curteous.The Great Wall Wing has a lovely restaurent which serves up breakfast each morning with a choice of fresh fruit, cooked breakfast (Bacon, Eggs, French Toast, Beans) or chinese variety. Whilst we did not sample the main restaurent, the menues and prices looked good with a mixture of chinese and western dishes on offer at very reasonable prices.There is a small but well equiped gym, 4 lane Brunswick bowling alley, sports bar with plasma tv's, the usual quality gift shops, a gentlemans clothes shop, and a travel agent.All in all we would highly recommend this hotel if you are using this as your base. Shopping areas are spread all over Shanghai so walking to most of them is not an option, however with the average taxi fare for upto 3 people being just £1.00 it really is not an issue. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Are the Chinese Accustomed to Hard Beds??? I went with my mom and dad to Shanghai and Beijing last May 2007. I had the opportunity to stay at both Holiday Inns in Downtown Shanghai and Beijing.The first thing I noticed about H.I. Downtown Shanghai is that they have really stiff beds and mattresses! I didn’t think this could happen to a four-star hotel in Shanghai – one of the biggest cities in the world. After my first night, I asked them to add more sheets to my bed since it was really hard – it was like sleeping on a single sheet of comforter on the floor! When I came back, nothing really changed. They simply added another sheet of blanket which really did nothing to soften up my cot (mine was an extra bed). Even the two beds in our room were as hard as my cot! I was wondering if this was really the Chinese standard for comfort. H.I. Downtown Beijing had better, softer beds! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great value nice staff and central location I chose this hotel because I had to make a 9am meeting downtown, also I was intrigued by the location near the railway station. The rate was a real surprise because every other international brand was priced 2-3X as much. From the airport, you can take the maglev then the subway on line# 2 to People's Square station where you switch to line # 1 to get to Shanghai Railway Station. You take exit #3. Just outside the exit is a huge mall, the hotel is on your left side.Some of the reviews here already made me expect the worst so I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly bell boy and the beatiful room (I will post photos when I get back home), which may be cosy by US standards but I just came from HK so it seemed spacious by comparison. There is free bottled water and coffee service in the cabinet. My favorite of the details is the small cloisonne bottled framed in a hardwood frame with beatiful silk matting, hanging in the bathroom.I did not eat in the hotel, opting instead to try the eateries in the mall. The Cafe De Coral is from Hong Kong and you can have a meal of BBQ pork rice for under 20RMB.Yeah, service in China is hit and miss and the carpet is old. But I have met mostly friendly and helpful people and that more than makes up for the fruitseller who charged me 2X knowing that I am a foreigner (even though I am Chinese by descent). "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Stayed at Holiday Inn Shanghai - not so great We stayed here for a few days with a Smartours travel group. The lobby and other common areas are nice and modern but the actual rooms are not so great. They are clean but a little outdated, hard beds, the blow dryer in the room sucks, a couple of mosquitoes somehow made their way into our room at night even though the windows were closed. I wouldn't stay here again. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Troubled stay at the Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai Recently stayed in Holiday Inn DownTown Hotel in Shanghai. The minute we showed our voucher to the receptionist, she asked us to pay another 130.00 US dollars to be upgrated to the rooms in the new wing. When we said we did not want to do so, she tried to persuade us again, by showing us pictures of the room and adding that the bed would be soft and that it would be a big quiet room. When we made it clear we were not interested, and asked to proceed the checking in so that we could finally go up to our room, she spoke in chinese and laughed with the rest of the stuff present at the time. Our room was on the 8th floor and it was big alright. However, the bed was really really hard so we asked the housekeeping to send us an extra mattress so that we could place it underneath. Tired as we were from the flight, we immediately went to bed. Soon we realized that even though it was night time, the noise was intolerable and we would have a tough time getting to sleep. Not only that, but the heating was not operating and we were really cold. Still, we decided that this would be dealt with the next day as we were tired and it was late anyway.The next day both my husband and I had pains all over our bodies because of the hard bed, and also had a cold. I immediately went downstairs to complain to the receptionist for giving us the worst room she could, and she only said we could have paid and got ourselves one of the new rooms. At that point I got really angry and demanded to spek to the manager. He escorted me to the room, and verified that in deed the heating was broken down, the room was noisy and also that the bed was hard. He took a look on our reservation paper, and said we will be immediately transferred to the 12th floor on one of the renovated rooms because that is where we were originally supposed to have been anyway! Soon a bell boy assisted us with our luggage and we went to the new room. This one was a lot smaller than the first one on the 8th floor, but it was brand new, with a softer matress and it seemed to be quiet too. Therefore we agreeded to spend the next 3 nights there.Breakfast was nothing special but what I have to specify is that the stuff was not wellcoming or warm at all ! Quite different to what I had expected for a Holiday Inn Hotel. The price for the restaurant in case you want to have dinner is about 35 dollars for buffet dinner, but they charge quite expensive all beverages...Back home I really can't tell I was able to find a lot of info about this hotel on the net, regarding the location, so it was a good thing the metro station was very near to the hotel. The second morning we were there, a Monday morning, we asked at 11.00 in the morning to change us a 100 euro bill , and we were told to go to a bank because as it was Sunday the previous day, they did not have enough money !!! That was really weird we thought, but we did not want to start our day arguing again. Therefore we left the hotel in search of the closest bank. Luckily, there are more than 4 banks in the neighboorhood but not one of them could assist us as they had a break (!) for an hour ! Then we went back to the hotel and demanded to have our bill changed. They did ! I cannot understand why you have to argue with everybody from the reception to have the simplest things done ! We enjoyed being in Sangai and perhaps will go back some time in the future, but we will definetely never stay in the same hotel ever again. The second room we were given was alright, but the hotel stuff both at the reception and the restaurant was so rude and not wellcoming, and anyway, there are soooo many other better hotels, so, never ever again in a Holidai Inn in Sanghai ... "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Stay Here Canada Hello fellow Canadians and travelers. I am here to tell you that if you are ever in Shanghi and need a great hotel. I suggest you stay at the Holiday Inn Downtown location in Shanghi. Yes you could pay much more$$$$ and stay at the RITZ ect.. However you will recieve much better service be it personal or otherwise at the Holiday Inn(Downtown). I have the so many good things to say but I will be brief and highlight one example. After meeting my wife on vacation in Shanghi 2 years ago while n a buisness trip. I can now say we are happily married for 1 year now. I had my aniversary this year at the holiday inn (downtown ). I wanted to surprise my wife with a beautiful day and cap it off with a aniversary hotel room. The staff who I advised of my plan and wishes to make this day as great as possible did everything and more to make it happen.In fact the staff at the Holiday Inn went way beyond my expectations. I thought, they will put a few candles and flowers and send us a bill to at check out time. NO WAY!The staff here not only made dinner wonderful, but they also made sure the entire room was dedicated to our aniversary. I mean there was a HUGE ARANGEMENT of flowers in a heart shape on the bed surrounded by rose petals. Each flower individually cut to size to fit the arrangement of flowers(very difficult job by hand). Orniments signifying &quot;Double Happiness&quot; a popular Chinese slogan for couples happily married, just married and or aniversary ect. Decorations, ornements and dinner was aranged, with champainge. There is much more but I fear you will quit reading soon. I am a very happy husband but my wife was even happier than I when she walked into the room. I mean she cried from the joy of surprise and the sheer beauty of the room in its entirety. I would have had no time to do what the staff at the holiday inn did for my wife and I. I wouldn't have thought to do most of the other things (to numerous to mention) as well. Talk to Jerry, Anthony and the rest of the holiday staff about all your needs, wants and desires and I can assure you happiness and satisfaction. Remenber Holiday Inn Downtown ShanghiRemember Jerry- ManagerRemember Anthony- manager Remember Holiday Inn StaffIf you remeber these things your stay in Shanghi will be perfect for sure! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Steer avay! I really can't understand how IC grooup can waste its brand firming such an old, dirty, noisy and out-of-everywhere hotel. It's a real trap. The only brightside is a servicefull personel, the rest - my godness! There's another one, nice, at Pudong: choose it, avoid Downtown! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great service reasonable location First of all, Holiday Inns in China are not like the ones in America. They're WAY better. In another league, really.We stayed on the executive level, which cost something like $15 or so more. But for that extra money, you get some breakfast in the lounge, unlimited drinks at the happy hour plus hot/cold appetizers, which you could make a meal out of if you were so inclined. The room was clean, and looked much more modern and featured many more amenities than you'd imagine looking at the exterior of this hotel. The bathroom was nice -- not luxurious, except for the unbelievalbe variety of toiletries. One reviewer wrote that the beds were hard. Well, yes, they are a bit hard everywhere in China. It's a cultural thing, not a quality thing. Most people get used to it, and it's supposed to be good for your back anyway.The location is hard to say too much good or bad about. I mean, it's a two minute walk from Shanghai's main train station, but unless you're going out of town, you won't use that so much. Then there's the subway, which is also just a few minutes' walk. That works well. But, while there is a bit of locals-oriented shopping around the hotel (and great &quot;hutong&quot; -- old backstreet -- neighborhoods, if you can find them!!), you usually end up traveling to other parts of the city to do stuff. The subway comes often, and the cabs are so cheap, that it hardly seems worth the concern. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Not great stay elsewhere! We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on the executive level of the Great Wall Wing. We did secure a great rate on the hotels website but in hindsight we wished we had paid more and stayed elsewhere. For an executive room the room was tiny, we had to move the chair away from the desk so we could walk past the bed. The bed was the worst we have ever had in a hotel room, extremely hard and when we rang housekeeping after a couple of nights of unbroken sleep they were unable to offer any assistance, in the end we resorted to adding an extra duvet on top of the mattress which helped slightly. The bathroom was very small and although kept clean was uninviting.We had breakfast in the executive lounge and the downstairs restaurant and both were very average and the staff were unwelcoming also. The happy hour in the executive lounge was ok but again staff were only prepared to do the bare minimum and didnt appear happy to do even that.The location was probably the worst factor, although it is close to the metro it is not a nice area to come back to at night.Unfortunately I dont feel I have much positive to say about this hotel perhaps it was because we had just spent 5 nights at the Crowne Plaza in Beijing where we had enjoyed a perfect stay and the Holiday Inn Downtown really didnt rate in comparison.I would not recommend staying at this hotel and if we return to Shanghai in the future we will spend more money and stay in the Nanjing Rd/Bund area. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Nice Hotel but Not Very Quiet There are two towers to the hotel: the Plaza Wing and Great Wall Wing. My room was in the Plaza Wing. It was quite large for a Holiday Inn, and looked to have been upgraded recently. The bathroom was clean and well maintained. The room had internet service for US$15 per day which is very high, particularly for China. My room was very loud. Construction is ongoing constantly in Shanghai, and the hotel is directly in front of the main train station. Handy for getting around the city, but not when trying to sleep. The gym (located in the Great Wall wing) is small, but has two modern treadmills and a good selection of weights. The breakfast buffet, although cheap for about US$6 (if not included in the room rate), was also average, although it does have a made to order omelet bar. This hotel appears to be frequented mostly by business travelers, although it did have a fair number of tourists. There are places to eat and shop in the vicinity of the hotel, including several coffee shops and high end department stores, but no supermarkets in the area. If not for the noise during my stay, this hotel would get a much higher ranking. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Very good hotel in a very good location! We stayed here for 3 nights in February 2006. At first looking at it on the map it seems to be out of the way. But it really isn't. Cabs are cheap and plentiful. The subway stop is right near by. There is also lots of malls, shops and stores right around the hotel itself.Best part of the location is the quick and easy access to the Subway. No problem for people who can only speak English. Very very user friendly.Taxi drivers did not seem as aware of this hotel though (and let me tell you Holiday Inn Downtown Shanghai does not mean a thing to them you must bring the hotel card!). Even with the card and my Mandarin speaking mother our cabbie seemed a bit unsure of how to get there (but we got there and for pretty much the same price as the other direction) so it didn't really matter in the end.Also I think it is stupid to have 2 different hotels which are not linked at all to have the same name (they face each other on a pedestrian plaza). Our &quot;wing&quot;'s gym was a sorry excuse for a gym with some free weights and no cardio machines. In it you are directed to go to the other &quot;wing&quot; hotel for the larger gym. Thankfully each wing has it's own restaurant for breakfast. Breakfast is your usual Chinese, Japanese, American breakfast. You'll find whatever you want here. It was very very good. The room has Ethernet Internet Access for a fee which I thought was reasonable. There is a daily maximum (I forget the details).Rooms were decent just like a regular Holiday Inn in North America. Clean, nice bathrooms (with shower curtains that were too short though!).Good service and a very attractive lobby for those who are into those sorts of things.I would stay here again if I returned to Shanghai! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Convenient location for subway riders As part of a hotel/plane package, my husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown. This Holiday Inn is comparable to those in the United States. The hotel rooms were comfortable and clean. Unlike many hotels, this hotel had sufficient lighting. The included buffet breakfast had western and Chinese food selections. It was very easy to put together a bacon, made to order eggs, juice, toast and coffee breakfast. There is absolutely nothing to see close by. The subway, however, is around the block and very easy to use. We travelled to all of the tourist spots via the subway. Tickets can be purchased from automated machines with subway stops and fares in English. Once you are on the subway, stops are announced in English. Also, maps and exits are posted in English. If you can figure out the subway system in NYC, San Francisco, London, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Tokyo, or Kyoto, you will have no problem on the Shanghai subways! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,Brilliant this hotel was brill and i would deffinatley reccomend it to anyone visiting shanghai. fab!!! 
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Great location My husband, a couple of friends and I stayed here for a week. It was a great location near a metro and train stop so independent travel was very easy. It was very much like most Holiday Inns. The breakfast was great. Comfortable and clean rooms. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Don't go there! I stayed here for one night in August. The room was very small, the air conditioning noisy, the bathroom quite shabby (the shower was aimed at the wall not at the bath). The fridge in the room was noisy and in fact the room itself didn't block out noise at all - we could hear the traffic outside, the people in the corridors and the noise through the walls of the adjoining bedrooms. The light didn't work in the room and it took 2 hours for someone to come and fix it.Breakfast is in a make-shift restuarant and the selection is poor.This is not what you would expect from a Holiday Inn - my advice - don't go there! "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Picky traveler liked this hotel I stayed here in fall of 2004. Although the hotel isn't 'downtown', it's directly across from the train station which is good if you're travelling to other parts of China. The room was very clean and good size. The staff and service was above my expectations for a Holiday Inn. Lobby and common areas were nice and clean. Bathroom was large and clean as well. Nothing really bad to say at all. I would rate my experience here as 'above average'. This is a newer hotel. "
holiday inn downtown shanghai ,"Adequate night's sleep Having read the Frommers Guide we decided to stay at the Holiday Inn downtown Shanghai. We chose the Plaza Wing as it was reportedly &quot;slightly more upscale.&quot; We had requested a no smoking room in advance and were told that none were available upon check in. When the front desk clerk realized that we would go elsewhere, he suddenly found a room. Silly things such as they will only let you cash $100 US at a time ( all other hotels in China never questioned this) were also a nuisance. Overall, the room was &quot;satisfactory&quot; and more than adequate. Walk time to the train station is about 5 minutes and this saves a great deal of time if you are taking the trains to Souzou or Hangzhou. "

holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"Express indeed For US $120 more or less for 3 nights stay, its value indeed! Be ready to deal with the staff, some do not speak english...prepare to talk chingrish and communicate like talking to a baby. That we dont mind, its one of the adventures you go through when you're in mainland China. Things turned out well though. Left our luggage with them when we travelled to Hangzhou. There is also a free internet in the lobby.Nonetheless, the Holiday Inn Express has all what you ask for from the hotel, sans the excess (pool, ref, mini bar , room service et al) Breakfast was fine - it came with set meals, basic eggs, hard boiled eggs in hot tea, sausages &amp; bacon, congee, simple veggies and breads. Also comes with coffeee, teas, juice.Rooms are small but clean. Bed and sheets are great too. Hotel also has free laundromat. The hood's safe even at night. Its situated in front of the creek and the location is not commuter friendly. Some Shanghai cabbies do not know where it is. It is also near Carrefour. It is suggested that you ask the front desk . It is also around 10 to 15 mins walk to the nearest train station. Cabs in Shanghai are also cheap. If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there aint many joints open nearby. Front desk offered a McDonalds delivery but we declined. We're in Shanghai and we'll eat McDo? :( "
holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"Hotel Review - Holiday Inn Express Putuo Shanghai Nice Hotel at an affordable rate in Shanghai. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is basic. The rooms were noisy from all the new construction especially early in morning. Short walking distance to many restaurants and Carrefour. The only drawback is access to taxis, this is my second time in 2 years staying at this hotel and many taxis do not know where it is located. As well taxis do not hang around this hotel, so tell the hotel if you need a taxi in advance.ThanksMartin "

holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"new hotel i have stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, i should say that the hotel looks quite new specially the interior of building is quite in a new shape.the rooms are in a good size all having a writing desk and a small sofa. you receive comlimentary tea and coffee plus two bottles of water every day. also the bathroom is in a good state.talking about the breakfast, we had this included in the room rate but i should say it wasn't the best breakfast, you had less choice but both chinese and western. just like most of the hotels in china the staff had a real language difficulty.the main down-point on this hotel is the location, eventhough it's quite close to the metro on line 3 (5 minutes walk) but you have to go through a poor area and maybe for a tourist it doesn't look great. also the hotel is located at the end of a narrow road which most of the taxis think it's dead end.all in all i liked this hotel. specially the price was right for the quality. "
holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"A Standard Business Hotel This property is not located in Shanghai city. It is a 25 minute car ride from the city during non-peak hours (11pm). During peak hours, expect a longer drive.If you are a tourist to Shanghai, I do not suggest you stay here as the distance is unbearable. Hotels in Shanghai city are not as expensive as HKG, so i suggest you give this hotel a miss. You will not regret it as the distance can be rather daunting. Traveling after a long flight, you do not want to go through bad traffic throughout your stay.Breakfast is very miserable. Rooms are clean, but very tiny. "
holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"Great Hotel ... Out of the way though This property is a solid 3.5* hotel, located in the suburb.Rooms: very new, clean rooms, sheets changed daily, triple sheets, giant shower box, bright, and curtains that overlap so you can sleep in properly. Bottled water provided daily.Excellent free buffet breakfast: fruit, veggie, toasts, Chinese congee, chow fan noodle are available as well as three main courses to choose from (beef noodle soup, fried rice, and western style - eggs, hash brown, and bacon).Free internet: three computer stations are available in the lobby as well as free wifi.Location: It's a bit out of the way. Most cab drivers cannot find it without the hotel name card. The check in agent will give you a card when you check in and use this to show the cab driver.

holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"Good service but getting expensive... Was forced to stay this hotel for almost two weeks due to unexpected travel glitches. Overall, I enjoyed stay in this hotel. &quot;Price&quot; was very reasonable. It was only RMB330 nett including free breakfast and internet a night. This rate now went up to RMB380 nett. The hotel is very new and provide shuttle services to Jongsan Park station (Metro Line 2, 3, 4) four times (8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30) during week day.Also, the hotel's &quot;Great Room&quot; restaurant offers a number of set menu for both lunch and dinner, and they are around RMB 20 to 30. The hotel staffs said that it used to have laundry room but got rid of it. Too bad.. Also, one of the biggest Carrefour is just across the street although it take some time to figure out how to get there.However there are some areas of improvement1) Location: Very remote area, and hard to find. Even cab drivers have trouble. Use &quot;Uning ru&quot; and &quot;Kwangpusi ru&quot;2) Renovation??: The hotel is constantly in construction...3) English??: Although hotel staffs tried to understand but most hotel staffs have very limited ability, and just speak in Chinese. Leverage &quot;survival English&quot; like &quot;shuttle&quot;4) Too many group travellers: Well can't help but...Also, I think that the overall price of this hotel will increase rapidly. Already RMB50 increase.. "
holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"Above Average Positives:1) Clean, modern looking rooms2) Clean bathrooms - good showers.3) Free Internet4) Front desk will call cabs for you5) Free breakfast - though mostly Chinese-type breakfast. There are eggs and toast as well.Slight Negatives:1) Taxis don't normally know the location of the hotel even with an address. Would suggest to bring a map that indicates the location of the hotel. Keep in mind there are several Holiday Inns in Shanghai so may be confusing for the taxi driver. Cab ride to Nanjing Road about RMB25-30.2) Water has funny smell. I used the free bottles of water they provided to brush my teeth. "
holiday inn express putuo shanghai ,"EHI Experiance I enjoyed my two week stay at the Express by Holiday Inn in Shanghai. The hotel is new and very clean, it was also very quite. Some people do not like the location but taxi's are easy to come by in Shanghai and this hotel's rates were reasonable. The buffet breakfast was good. The staff that works at the front desk speak very good English and are very helpful. The air conditioning in the room did not work great but was not terrible. I have been told by people who travel to China often that the air conditioning in most places does not work very well. The internet service on the computers in the business center also do not work very well but I was able to get into my e-mail most days I was there. I would reccomed this hotel to anyone who is visiting Shanghai and does not have a problem traveling around via taxi cab. "

holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"top value If you don't mind taking the Metro and waking short distances, then the Jinqiao HIE is for you. Shanghai is a rather pricey town and this accommodation stands for value. In my opinion --- a good location -just around the corner from Carrefour, an excellent takeout sushi stand and a couple fast food places. Yes, it is possible to Metro, Maglev in from Pudong-- I did it on the way back. From this hotel to Pudong airport- and with one wheeled suitcase ( not tons of luggage) just take Metro from Jufeng (line 6) to Longyang station ( line 2) and get on the Maglev straight to Pudong. Get more info if you google this route, and save some $$$. Oh yes ---FYI on the way IN from Pudong as taxi drivers seem to have a hard time finding this place. ...bring a map!!!! "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Good Hotel for a business traveler and good value for the money spent; but could do better with a good restaurant. I stayed in this hotel with my colleagues on and off for around seven days. A neat and decent hotel with some of the staff communicating in English. The hotel is a bit away from the main business centers. But for a few of the travelers who would prefer a quiet evening after a busy day, this could mean a blessing in disguise. The only major draw back is a lack of good restaurant. The one in the hotel has limited service, but extends good hospitality. While a departmental stores and ATMs are around the corner, there are no good restaurants nearby. And if you happen to be a vegetarian the fruit shop in front of the hotel is a boon. "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Good value for money I wanted an inexpensive hotel for a 2-night stopover in Shanghai, and this hotel gave me what I wanted. The room was good - would have been great if the English TV channels had worked! They had the usual BBC /CNN etc listed, but No Signal was all you got if you selected them. I understood what some other travellers have said about hard beds, but it wasn't ultra-hard: I like a mattress on the hard side, and for me it was perfect.The hotel is about 250 metres from the Metro station: go down the stairs from the station and walk straight along the road (past the taxi stand), over the river, and the hotel is on your left. It is very walkable if you don't have heavy luggage - you can see the hotel from the station.Getting in and out of the city is easy via Metro. I used the Maglev and Metro to get from the airport to the hotel, but decided to take a taxi on the return journey, and would definitely recommend that: only about 120 yuan and it took only half the time and one tenth of the hassle! (Get the airport info lady to write the name and address of the hotel in Chinese.)Next to the hotel is a supermart, plus a couple of cafes: I ate in one of them and had a delicious meal for about 2 pound.A big plus was the free internet in the room (and there are computers in the foyer if you don't have a laptop). The minuses were lack of English-language TV; and there was no porter, so you have to get your luggage to / from your room yourself.I was put off by others' description of the breakfast so didn't go down the first morning; and kicked myself on the second morning, as I had a delicious meal of savoury rice with absolutely delicious green beans. Not what I'd normally have for breakfast, but it was so yummy - I wanted the recipe and I seldom cook! If you want European, you can have toast, boiled eggs, small sausages, and ham. "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Out of the way but a fantastic value The hotel is a ways outside of the busy part of shanghai, but easily eached via Line 6 on the Shanghai subway system (which is very new and modern). Easy to get here from the airport via train; no need to take a taxi. Hotel itself is very clean and modern, offers free internet access in the lobby, and has a nice free breakfast every morning. Very nice staff, most of whom speak enough english. KFC and supermarket right around the corner; also a good haircut place across the street. East side of hotel can see Pudong on a clear day. Very good AC and beds. Really the only disadvantage is the distance from central Shanghai, otherwise this is a great place to stay. "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Great Value stopover Hotel is about 500m from the Metro, (Jufeng station), not 200m as stated on the HI Express website so it takes about 6-7minutes to walk although there are no roads to cross. There is a Carrefour supermaket next door with a KFC and Younge King (Chinese fast food). Hotel is a nice example of a HI Express, but as in other hotels in China they have an issue with the kids eat free policy and/or try to charge for kids in the room, which is one of the key benefits of HI Express for familes. Keep a hard copy of your booking which clearly infers that children are included to prove the point.Allow and hour to transfer to/from the airport by MagLev and Metro, though you will probably make it in less. "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Excellent Hotel and very cheap! Internet was free!!! Very good and modern decor. Not close to attractions, but we just stayed one night for a long layover. It's not very close to the airport either, maybe 30 mins by taxi. In hindsight we should have taken the train from the airport, it was so easy and much faster and cheaper. Taxi cost like 120 yuan. bed was hard as most are in china, but service was excellent and hotel was very clean! "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,"Excellent This hotel is not so close to the city centre and to the main attractions, but metro line 6 station (Jufeng road) is only 2 minutes walk away from the hotel. The ticket price from Longyang road (Maglev station) only costs 3 yuan per person. The highest metro fare was 6 yuan to Qibao which is on the other side of the Town. The location is perfect, next to the hotel is a carrefour supermarket, a KFC and an excellent Chinese restaurant called Yongheking. The only negative point with the hotel is the breakfast. If you like Chinese-style breakfast (fried rice, noodle, and other vegies) than it's good for you, if not than toast with jam will be boring after a week or longer. The rooms are perfect and big enough for travellers. And also very quite and clean. "
holiday inn express shanghai jinqiao ,good basic hotel My husband stayed in this hotel for nine days. It is realy cheap but clean. Build few years ago so everything in still new. Just 10 minutes walk to subway(metro). No attractions around but good for someone who needs clean hotel for little money.

holiday inn pudong hotel ,Better than expected - comfortable and easy and would go back. stayed 20 daysGood points-hotel is much better than average Holiday Inn - has a swank feel about atrium and decor in public areas.friendly staffgood size room with stylish decorexcellent business loungeindoor swimming pool but heavily chlorinated and in need of some tlc or revampbad points -hotel appears to tolerate a couple of spivs offering sex with local ladies who hang around on pavement right outside hotel so expect to be asked if you want massage with happy ending with good time ladies everytime you leave the hotel. 2 individuals in particular wre there every day for 3 weeks.Irish bar is very empty apart from a smattering of local ladies. 
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"New and nice This was my first trip to a Holiday Inn for some time and I was positively surprised. The hotel was brand new and of very good quality, not your usual Holiday Inn standard. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Good mid-range hotel in Pudong I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights for a business trip. On arrival check-in was fast and efficient. I had travelled to China on an overnight flight, and arrived at the hotel at around 9am in the morning. I was able to check straight-in, and was only charged a ‘half day’ for the early check-in, and was still offered the inclusive breakfast.The room was of a reasonable size on the 27th floor, and very quiet. Bathroom was also of a reasonable size, with a square ‘two person’ size tub and overhead shower. The ‘flat screen’ TV had a good selection of channels, including CNN News channel and BBC World News.Internet is via cable, and charged at 1 RMB/min (up to a maximum charge of 80 RMB in a 24 hour period). Within the room, the power sockets are configured so that they conveniently take British, European and US plugs.Breakfast is served on the ground floor via a buffet, and offers a 50:50 split between western and Chinese cuisines. Overall the selection was good, and the service received was fast and efficient. There is also a chef on both cuisine sides to cater for individual requests.The hotel has few in house restaurants/bars. Flannagan’s, an Irish bar on the ground floor seems to be popular with single business travellers, and they have a regular live band. Also on the ground floor, where breakfast is served, is another restaurant. However there is no noticeable difference between this restaurant, Flannagan’s and room service in terms of menu options. I did try a Japanese restaurant on the second floor, which I believe offers a sort of Japanese/fusion experience. So you can order usual Japanese sushi favourites, along with western dishes all shaped in small portions (e.g. potatoes/cheese croquets and egg omelette pieces etc). Location wise the hotel is situated on one of the main roads through the Pudong district, and is a good location if you want to be in the area. However, if you need to be in the financial centre, or the main shopping areas, I would choose a hotel closer to that area (although a taxi journey to and from those districts costs only £2-3) but could take a while if you’re travelling in rush-hour and need to use the tunnel connecting both sides of the river.Overall I was very satisfied with the stay at the hotel. If you want to go “higher-end” then there is a St Regis situated right next door to the Holiday Inn which could be worth considering. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Great hotel crappy food Stayed on the 32nd floor, in an awesome room. The best thing was the 2 person bathtub which I enjoyed everynight after walking the dirty streets of Shanghai. The room was very clean and the hotel felt safe. The internet was even reliable, expensive, but reliable.The only down side to this hotel was their food. The room service food was, well, interesting. I ordered pizza, and got one with an egg yolk in the middle even though it didn't say that on the menu. It made me sick even though I scraped the yolk off. The next night they gave me cocoa powder in my pepper shaker. I didn't notice until after I had put it on my noodles.I tried the karaoke bar, which I was the only person there. When I asked if there were other hotel guests there the girl brought out 6 more girls in matching outfits and said &quot;usually girls don't ask for girls&quot; that was NOT what I meant, so I left and went downstairs to the Irish Pub to get a beer and listen to the great treat of a Chinese band doing Van Halen.Other than that, great hotel. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Great Holiday Inn! All good, staff, breakfast, rooms and fantastic beds (nice and soft rather than the usually hard beds in most Fast East hotels). We liked this hotel.A little out from the centre but taxis not expensive and lots of local facilities. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Nicely redecorated almost new hotel Most of the hotel is newly renovated, they really did a nice job. Rooms are comfortable, beds are good, bathroom excellent with a large shower / bathtub.Some small issues: Internet - you can buy a 24 hour pass, however if during your 24 hours you log off and then on again, you do not get told how much time you have left. Hence I had 4 times 24 hour charges on my bill, but I only used the system 2 days. But with out argue it was taken off the bill. Skype works, but iChat does not, unfortunately.Speed is average.Coffeeshop food is somewhat limited, breakfast also quite limited and expensive for what is offered.BUT I for sure will stay there again. Favourite hotel on the Pudong site. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,Good hotel The Holiday Inn Pudong was a good place to stay during my brief visit of Shanghai in September 2004. From what I remember the rooms were very good (although I was in an Executive room). Good views from the room windows too. Would recommend. 
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Good Hotel but careful on the rip off spa service! Everything was great except the massage service. This is extortion. They should be ashamed of the prices they charged. 6000 RMB is not acceptable for any type of service.Will not stay here again just because of this.Also, I wanted to swim and the pool staff could not answer my question - they didn't speak english and were not willing to explain anything. I didn't end up swimming. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Great hotel Location so-so.. Like everything in life it’s about the ratio between what you get and what you pay.Let’s start from the basics: I stayed paying the hotels weekend rate of about $75 (exclusive breakfast and internet connection) for this price it’s a deal hard to beat.. (Their official weekday price is $225+)The room was excellent, elegant, clean and comfortable, a desk for work very useful. Breakfast rich and tasty (was not included), the overall hotel (lobby etc) very elegant and nice.Location is so-so, all is accessible by cab, still in the morning rush hour getting to the center can take 35- 45 Min. For vacation or leisure absolutely a steal for less than $100, business traveler consider what it will take in the morning drive. My recommendation, don’t hesitate to email or call and try to get if for less than $150 (1000-1200 RMB), for $200+ check and compare with other options.. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"HI Pudong = Great value for money! great value for money!clean rooms, good location for business travelers. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Must be one of the world's best Holiday Inns From the warmth of the smiles, and the treatment as a special guest of this hotel, the Holiday Inn Pudong stay was darned near perfect. The lobby radiated happy employees. They are well trained and enjoy their jobs. You can tell after just a few moments. So before you even wonder if there is an Priority Club (PC) upgrade or what the room looks like, you feel special.The upgrade was provided. The &quot;Customer Experience Manager&quot; was behind the PC check-in desk and said the management was very happy I decided on their Holiday Inn. He said they were proud of their new rooms and he personally escorted us to the room with the bellman and the bags. (I said to myself, maybe they know I write these reviews, but then after seeing all the recent top five-bullet ratings for this hotel, I realized they just treat their guests right!)The room was superior in the truest sense. A corner room, it was not huge, but comfortable, light and very modern with a huge bath area and tub for two. The staff people remembered my name, albeit in a Chinese way, calling me Mr. Robert throughout my stay. Not just one, but a handful of employees memorize your name or do a really fast check on the computer to make sure they address you personally. Again, they are trained to make you feel special. As a Trip Advisor Destination Expert, I have been in many Shanghai hotels, and this one went all out in customer service.The location in Pudong is a neutral factor in my opinion. You are a short two block walk to subway Line 4, just one stop from Line 2 (downtown and Maglev station to Pudong airport). If you enjoy some good exercise, it is an interesting five to ten minute walk to Century Blvd (Line 2 station), and then down to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao and World Financial Center buildings, or up to Century Park. There are plenty of taxis at the front door, something you should not take for granted in busy Shanghai.You are not on the Bund, but then again you are not harassed constantly by touts staked out at every tourist hotel. The Pudong area is modern Shanghai, as safe as can be. Upscale shopping is nearby as well as fashion market shopping at the Technology Museum subway stop.Contrary to another reviewer's comments, there are several nice Chinese &quot;white linen&quot; restaurants within a block. Heji is practically next door, not a storefront but on the 6th floor, and is crowded with locals eating copious amounts of great typical Shanghainese food. Whoops, back to the hotel review...The breakfasts were very good in quality. The hotel's lunch and dinner menus looked very affordable for such a high quality hotel. I will try the in-hotel restaurant next time. The hotel had the fastest internet I have seen in my 12 visits (and maybe 50 hotel stays) in China in the past three years. Lightning fast, just like my DSL at home. It costs 80 yuan, not a bargain but cheaper than some upscale hotels in Shanghai.Which brings me back to the overall quality of the Holiday Inn Pudong. The staff and accommodations will leave no doubt in your mind. You will wish every hotel, not just a Holiday Inn, could reach this outstanding quality. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,Shanghai City the hotel is in the city centre and not very convenient from the business perspective. there are not many eateries around and hence not the likings for a tourist. 
holiday inn pudong hotel ,Class Holiday Inn Had been to Nanjing on business trip and had to visit shangai for the weekend. Stayed in the top floor and room offers all facilities. There are weekend prices and the main attraction of the hotel is the staff helpfullness. The hotel is located at Pudong and central to all the shopping places in Shangai. Taxis are very cheap if we stay at Holiday Inn Pudong and had recommended this place to my friends. Offer evening breakfast but then there is a hotel regis where resturants are situated in the ground floor and 38th floor. Food is good made of Olive Oil.Those who wish to visit Shangai should stay in holiday inn Pudong and ask fot the top floor rooms if available. The room is good enough for 2 people and if u need seperate bed you must tell them well in advance. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. 
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"affraid I arrives yesterday to holiday inn pudong in dongfang road, very late because my flight was ca1950, maybe at 11 o'clock, I am platinium priority club member then they give to me the room in the executive floor, I was thirsty and I take one bottle of white wine, I didn't notice that the bottle was open before, then I drink it and was pipi, this is incredible, then when I go down to the reception for tell them about the problem, they said maybe I drink the bottle of wine and I don't want to pay, I write to u.s.a. for complain about this and I am still waiting an answer, this hotel is not recomendable, very high price, low quality service. Maybe this page will not accept in the fuorum my complaint but I will write it everywhere. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Now a very nice hotel I give this hotel a 5 star rating based on what you get for the price in Shanghai. I am in Shanghai several times each year and I find that this hotel is far better value than the other hotels at which I stay. The hotel has been completely renovated - many of the other reviewers had complaints about the noise during the renovations and I agree with them. I am fortunate that I stay there for business so I was always up before the noise started. The good news is that the construction is finished. The rooms are all newly renovated - The rooms compare to those in other Shanghai hotels which are several times the price. They are very clean, very well designed and everything works. Our group stays here regularly and we find that all of the rooms are now excellent. The restaurant service and food has improved immensely - along with a complete renovation of the restaurant, they also hired a Dutch manager and he seems to have been able to work a miracle in the main western restaurant. The Japanese restaurant on the second floor is still a bit dodgy, so my advice is to avoid that one. They have an Irish bar - Irish name but with a Filipino band - but there is draft guiness and pool tables and it is generally a fun and safe place for a late night drink. Back to why I gave this a five star rating - the staff are always very friendly and helpful and they speak good English. I book this hotel through Priority Club and there is never a problem on check-in and they are generous with upgrades. The hotel lobby and the rooms are always very clean, unlike some very expensive hotels in Shanghai. The hotel is rated as a four star hotel and my experience is that it is a good or better than most of the five star hotels in Shanghai, but at a fraction of the price. I would strongly reccomend this hotel to anybody who is staying in Pudong on business, since it is not in a tourist area. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"They finished remodeling...i think I think this was my 3rd time at this hotel. When I was there this time, I didn't any jackhammers or saws. However, the hotel next door was under renovation (probably getting ready the world expo in 2010).The hotel's lobby and guest rooms looked more contemporary. I think they also added some more English TV channels as well. The internet speed was so-so. The hotel's restaurants aren't that good IMO. The breakfast buffet is good for Chinese standards, but would probably pass on it if an IHOP was nearby (there's a McDonalds within a 5 min walk). The Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor wasn't good. They served Japanese food that tasted like provincial Chinese food.Room service was still pretty prompt. I ordered spaghetti at 2am, and it took them about 25 minutes. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Transformed into a first class experience The renovations have just come to and end and the transformation is fabulous. While the rooms aren't sprawling the careful design gives plenty of room to work and rest. The feeling is now like a 5 star property and not the Holiday Inn that we used to know. With new restaurants, and new club lounge and a whole new feel. Flangans the &quot;Irish Pub&quot; is still there and still a welcome relief and a great meeting place. Staff are friendly and the level of english spoken makes the stay easy. Highly recommended and value for money. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"great hotel if wasn't under contruction If you want to stay in the pudong area ( ie east of the river and most tourists should stay on the other side, west of the river, getting in between is a pain ) this is an excellent hotel in all aspects exept the 8am to 8pm construction noise, jack hammers all the time. everything else is perfect but you couldn't pay me to stay here again until the consruction is finished.the staff is excellent "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Hammerjack Inn We stayed at this hotel for 8 days. From 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening, Saturday and Sunday included, it was a concert of renovation work tools. Impossible to rest in the day time even in the newly renovated room on the 32nd floor. Before booking check that renovation works are 100% over. Otherwise this hotel would be quite comfortable and as usual in Asia the personel is very helpful.Jean-René Bergé "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"Holiday Inn Pudong great for Western travelers I traveled to Shanghai alone on business and I knew that staying at a Western hotel chain would be essential. I arrived and had no trouble. The staff spoke english well and were quick to help me get around the city and make recommendations. The rooms and beds are large, which you don't get a lot in China. There was a plate of fresh fruit waiting for me in my room when I arrived. This is a nice touch after a 20 hour flight. Overall, a great place to stay! "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,"It's ok. I stayed here for 3 nights just this week. The hotel is located in the Pudong area, where many new developments in Shanghai are located. We chose the hotel since it is one of the more reasonably priced ones in the Pudong area when our travel agent checked.However what we paid did not include the breakfast which is usually included in most of the hotels i have stayed in. We ended up having to pay approx. USD15-16 for the breakfast. The room size is quite good. There is enough space to move around despite having 2 twin beds and luggage. The bed is comfortable. The toilet is due for renovation. It's still usable but looks dated compared to the room that goes with it. They make up for this by giving a lot of free toiletries like shampoo, combs, etc.What bothered me was that the airconditioning was not working well when we checked into the room. To their credit, the hotel staff promptly came to check when we complained about this. However until the day we left it still was not working properly. I felt that it was a bit warm in the room. We should have asked to be transferred to another room. I guess this did not happen bec. we only were in the room in the evenings after dinner, and since it was quite cold in Shanghai during this time of year, we did not feel hot despite the aircon not working. For the 3 nights i did not use the comforter and just wore a shirt and boxers. The internet connection is not high speed for sure! I paid 80RMB for 24 hour access and the download speed was only around 10 kbps, sometimes up to 15 kbps. This is slow, our office has faster internet connection than that. Thus it's a bit overpriced for me. "
holiday inn pudong hotel ,Ok not great !! Stayed here for the secong time in a year. Booked through company policy so gave it a try again. The hotel itself is fine and has a good Irish Bar attached with some pleasant bar food available.Room was adequate but I had a very unpleasant smell which I couldn't locate the source. I will proabably not stay here again and will try other hotels in the area. 
holiday inn pudong hotel ,Lovely staff This is a lovely hotel with large rooms and excellent service. The staff have problem understanding English but are very hospitable. I was on the 18th Floor with a lovely view of the city. It is a little distance away from the Bund but you can get a taxi easily to the bund or back. Advise you to carry a card of the hotel in local language as incase you get lost this will be the only method you could come back as local population does not understand English easily.

"
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Better than your average HI but a bit far out of the centre We stayed here for 3 nights in August. A perfectly comfortable Holiday Inn with very comfortable beds and a choice of pillows in the room (no asking for them). Restaurant was OK, international menu dinner - nothing to get excited about but perfectly acceptable. Breakfast buffet was quite good. Location was on a busy main road (noise in our room was not a problem but we were about the 8th floor). Minibar very expensive - we bought a dozen cans of beer and soft drinks for the price of one beer - go to the shop outside the front door! The main problem was distance to the main attractions of Shanghai. A good hour by road during the day with traffic as it is in Shanghai (bad). The nearest metro is a good 30 minutes walk - forget it - it's always hot and humid and taxis are VERY cheap. Rooftop pool (indoor) is nice. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Good hotel with great breakfast The hotel is modern with good service and staff very helpful.The breakfasts were the best that we had exoerienced in China with a large variety of food.The television had at least 6 English speaking channels.The pool and fitness centre is also subperb with a large pool and spa, steam room and sauna as well as a gym and golf room.The only criticism is the cost of internet usage in the business centre. It is one of the most expensive I have experienced anywhere in the world.The drinks in the bar are also expensive considering you can buy the same beer in a little shop just outside the hotel for a fraction of the cost.The location is also a little too far from downtown and train station.

holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Great service in a great location This was already my second visit during 2009. The hotel went through a renovation program and you feel very comfortable from the minute, when you arrive.

holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Great place to stay. I can't say much about the price, because everything was covered in the tour we went on, but the hotel itself is sensational. WiFi throughout, great facilities (pool etc) and the rooms we stayed in were quite large based on my other experiences in Asia. The staff at the hotel are also fantastic. We didn't have the communication issues we found at other hotels we stayed at in China, and they were alway able to help out when we needed it.Though the hotel is a bit of a way out from the city center, it shouldn't cost you more than 20RMB to get from Nanjing Road to the hotel itself. There's a convenience store downstairs, and a few places to eat (including McDonalds) just down the road. There's also a games arcade across the road for the kids!All in all, a great place to stay, in a quite location a bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"We really enjoyed the Vista We stayed 3 nights at the Holiday Inn Vista and loved it! We were travelling as a family of 5 and the hotel was able to accomodate us with one room having two double beds and one extra single bed. It was great to only have to pay for one room. Yes, the extra bed made things a little tight, but the room was still very clean and comfortable. After long and hot days walking around Shanghai, our 3 kids were very happy to jump in the very well maintained pool located on the top floor. Another big plus about this hotel are the amazing breakfasts: very clean, lots of choices (american and asian styles), very good coffee!The price of the room was right given that hotels closer to the downtown area can charge twice as much. Yes the hotel is a bit out of the way but to us, it wasn't a problem given that travelling by taxi in Shanghai is so easy and so cheap! Staff at the reception and at the concierge were friendly and very helpful. "

holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Excellent stay great service ok location Last May I stayed in this hotel for a short business trip to Shanghai. My company booked the hotel so I did not really know what to expect. Because it was a Holiday Inn I did not had that high expectations for my stay.But my stay was excellent. The hotel is not like the old Holiday Inn's. It's totally refreshed and gives a trendy and fresh welcoming upon my arrival.The rooms were very nice. I booked a Kingsize bedroom and it was big enough for me. Especially the bed and the rainforest shower were something really enjoyable.The location of the hotel is ok. I prefere staying in a hotel located in the city centre, next to all the good restaurants. This hotel is located about 10/15 minutes from the city centre, still not that much for a huge city like Shanghai.Everyone in the hotel was very nice to me, especially the concierge staff because they did a really good job in providing me a list of the best possible restaurants in the area. Also my transportation back to the airport was arranged smoothly.To be short.. Great hotel, great service, ok location and one very satisfied guest! "

holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Global brand hotel can cover local issue. When I come to Shanghai, I frequently stayed this hotel. Because our Chinese staff lives near this hotel, and he has to pick me up early in the morning.First stay was in around 2005, when may be just the hotel opening. At that time hotel service and facilities had not been organized well, for example shower didn't have hot water for example and Chinese hotel clerk had only Chinese service and American manager was scolding them loudly.Even thourh it became somehow better and better recently except thin wall between rooms, I had several uncomfortable incident at this hotel. When I checked in this hotel, hotel clerk suggested me to upgrade the room in exective floor. I agreed her suggestion and stayed the room one night. However, I couldn't sleep the night due to terrible noise of air conditioner. I complained the hotel clerk next morning and changed another room. She had no apology about this complainment. Only she showed her frustration to me.When my travel schedule was shorten and I asked the hotel clerk to change my stay, she locked me out my room. I could understand she might miss the computer operation, but she had no aplogy when I complained the incident.After this visit, I got their finishing blow when I got my credit card bill. They made double billing to me.Fortunately, Holiday Inn have local service office in my country, and I could negotiate with the local service desk. They solved this issue promptly.I got some lesson with this experience. I may still keep using global brand hotel even though it is higher cost. Because I can get local support if I got a trouble with the hotel in abroad. Another lesson is that I never stay Holiday Inn Vista Shanghai any more. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Average at best I stayed here a couple of times during my business trips to Shanghai. The hotel has everything you would expect from a Holiday Inn. The hotel room was decent but furniture was a bit old. The chinese restaurant there was quite good and reasonably priced. However, there wasn't much to see in the neigbourhood other than the railway station. And if you are looking for western style cuisine, the closest thing you can get would be from the department store across the street from the hotel.Oh...and most importantly, if you want to travel to the city centre, it's not close. With Shanghai's traffic conditions during working hours, it's not going to be an enjoyable taxi ride. "

holiday inn vista shanghai ,"The price is right but somewhat out of the way for tourists I was a tourist and the first 3 days of my 11 day visit to China I stayed at this hotel. It was booked by my tour agency. The only bad experience was at check-in . I had a confirmed reservation for a king bed and the hotel could not accomodate it. Also, i was a Holiday inn priority club member which usually is good for at least a free drink and sometimes an upgrade but not at this hotel . You may want to pay a few more bucks and ask for a deluxe room on their executive floor. There is an exercise room and lounge access if you do. I was booked into a standard room on the 10th floor which although a bit small was acceptable as it had all the necessary amenities and everything worked. There is construction going on behind the hotel and the hotel itself is on a busy street so you want to book a high floor. Breakfast was included and the food quality was quite good. Service was excellent at the restaurant. They even allowed us to have breakfast early one day when we had an early call on a guided tour. One thing to keep in mind though is that around rush hour this hotel is a longish though not too expensive cab ride to the downtown Shanghai area .Most of the tourist attractions are located in around the Bund and Nanjing Road where the more pricey hotels are located. The nearest fine restaurants to the hotel are a 20 minute cab ride away in an area called Xin Tiandi in the French Concession. Pricey by chinese standards but well worth the visit . For those of you who arrive with lap tops you will encounter sticker shock at this hotel. Expect to pay $13 an hour for internet access. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"a bit out of the way We stayed here with our 7 month old baby for 5 days. It was clean and safe and there were some places to eat nearby. As we had the small one with us we ate in every night in the hotel chinese restuarant which was superb (although overpriced by Chinese standards) as long as you were the only people there. When there was more than 2 tables the service became chaotic. Breakfast was a good buffet selection. Rooms were clean but not spotless and I did worry about the poor fish in the bowl.Downside is the location. Shanghai is not pushchair friendly so we were reliant on taxis which meant you effectively had to add a good hour onto anywhere you went as the traffic is so heavy. In saying that we never had a problem getting a taxi .Checkout was also an interesting experience (again as in all Chinese hotels we stayed in) if you are in a hurry - do it the night before you check out.Overall - fair price , for reasonable hotel. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Great Rooms Great Service Stayed here for 2 nights in their King Bed Deluxe Room. The hotel is decorated very nicely and the staff is helpful. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The bed is soft and cozy. The bathroom has a nice rain shower head. I was surprised to find a small fish bowl on the desk with 2 colorful fish swimming around.There are some restaurants and shops within walking distance from the hotel. Taxis are plentiful and cheap. A taxi to/from Pudong Airport runs about 180-190 RMB, which is a good deal considering it's 60 km away. Taxis to tourist areas run about 30 RMB each way.I highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay somewhere comfortable and upscale without spending a lot of money. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Reliable business hotel This was my return visit, stayed there for 3 nights on arrival to Shanghai/China. My previous stay was in May last year. My reasons for returning was because it was a rather pleasant hotel, comfortable, clean, efficient and friendly staff, and its location. However, in my opinion, some of the early rave reviews on this website grossly over rated this hotel. I would say it is a solid 3.5 star Holiday Inn. It is slightly out of the way from business/commercial area, or from a metro station but they are only short taxi rides away and taxis are very cheap. Its locatition on the Northeast of the city makes it very convinient for the Shanghai railway station, Shanghai Hongqiao airport and reasonably convinient for the Shanghai South Bus terminal.Note that while the hotel is next to a main road with plenty of taxis passing by, the hotel entrance is on a side road with no taxis at all, and hardly any taxi queue at the hotel for businss. A few who do only want to pick-up long distance fares like airport etc. Hotel doormen often have to go to the main road to wave for a taxi, but I fond it was a lot easier just do it yourself by walking to the main road. Another note is this hotel seems to have one of highest internet charges in China. 24hr charge is 115Y, while most other hotels in China in my experience, internet is free or at a nomila cost. Thankfully they also have a hourly rate of 10Y. Another note is for those previliged to use the executive lounge, the lounge is dispproportionally small and stark for the of the hotel. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Good hotel with confortable room I 've stayed at the Vista several times now and keep coming back. It's a good hotel, nice and comfortable rooms with a good bed, clean and I especially like the executive floor, where they have a nice quiet athomosphere. The hotel decor is nice and OK restaurant with nice staff. Pricey although, and got angry that they charged me 35RMB + tax for a diet Coke, that's a rip-off! Only problem was the long check-out time; I don't know why they take so long to check you out. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"First night in China Had two nights here at the end of September. This was a very welcoming hotel with comfy seats in the lobby. Had a fish in a little tank in our bedroom.Had a huge superb shower in our room although our friends had a bath. Thought the hotel had no bar but it turned out to be where the cakes were for sale. All drinks were hidden in the back room. Had a snack in this bar during the afternoon. Chinese dumplings, very nice. Felt very safe walking around outside the hotel although crossing the road was a bit of a nightmare. Much safer to use the footbridges to cross. Found a nice shopping mall 5mins from the hotel.Thoroughly enjoyed the buffet in the evening. Called western but plenty of dishes to choose from including Chinese. I had baby lobster cooked to order. Buffet breakfast was good too. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel After a long flight it was a welcome sight to arrive at the Shanghai Vista. The hotel is fairly new so the interior feels nice and fresh. All of the staff were friendly and helpful with good English for those with poor Mandarin!My room was a good size with an incredibly comfortable bed, nice and clean, in room safe and just about all the toiletries you could need were provided in the bathroom!The breakfast had a great selection of Chinese, European and American foods, healthy or otherwise! The evening buffet was equally as good. If you are veggie like me then you will easily be able to get a decent meal.There is a small shop outside that sells snacks and water etc. A small bottle of water was about 1.50 yuan which is literally next to nothing. The hotel does provide two complimentary bottles each day but should you need more then there is no need to go too far or pay too much.There is a coffee shop in the lobby which sells delicious cookies. I suggest you try the orange which goes down great with a cup of coffee.It's not a centrally located hotel although there are plenty of shops and food places a short walk away. It is however fairly close to the Jade Buddha Temple which is definitely worth a visit.Definitely an excellent hotel and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Good Pick Don't let the distance away from the city center scare you...I thought it'd scare me, but I was wrong. The hotel is located in a very busy neighborhood with a couple malls within walking distance (5-10 minutes). As such, there are plenty of eateries and shops in the vicinity. Also, there are restaurants right alongside the hotel and across the street...lots and lots of food options. The closest Starbucks, if you care to know, is a few blocks walk away.We did walk to the city center a couple times to take in the daily Shanghai scene outside of the tourist traps, and it did take over an hour. But, note that it wasn't a straight line - we frequently stopped into shops and poked our heads into eateries as well as markets to get a good feel of everyday citizenry life. Also, taxis are bountiful and the hotel usually has 1 or 2 waiting in que to take you anywhere for relatively cheap fares.The lobby of the hotel is modern and featured a pianist every night - she's good. The bar/restaurant did not seem crowded in the morning or night on each of the 5 days we were there. One thing worth noting is that the hotel is &quot;over&quot; staffed in the lobby...there were probably 15 staffers when 10 would suffice...almost seemed like they were hawking over you. The check-in clerks spoke enough English to communicate the essentials. Also, this is a negative, the staff did NOT know the area well...asked for the nearest coffee shop/cafe, and they were clueless. I would've guessed that this had to be one of the most common questions from their guests...as mentioned earlier, there is a Starbucks nearby. In redemption, however, we requested extra bottles of water and a fruit knife on separate occasions in the evening and they were promptly and courteously delivered...good service.The room we stayed in was modern, clean, and comfortable. We had a view of a school/small street - might've been the backside/quieter side. Regardless, we had double queen beds that were on the &quot;firmer&quot; side, but that's the Chinese way. The bathroom featured a rain shower, which was good, and also there were speakers linked to the tv when turned on.We utilized the concierge for booking a tour of Hangzhou. The pricing was steep, but we thought it would be a more personalized tour...not the case. It was like any other commercialized outfit...way too expensive, probably double what I would've payed outside. Just a warning.Overall, would go back to the hotel for its reasonable rate, location, and cleanliness. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Best Holiday Inn I've stayed at! We were on a tour of China and Shanghai was our last stop. When we saw that we'll be staying at a Holiday Inn, we were just hoping for the best. To our surprise, the hotel turned out to be a very nice one! The room was very clean and the decor was up to date. The beds weren't the typical hard beds found throughout China. Most of the staff spoke very good English and were very helpful. The hotel had a good business center and lobby area. The stay included free breakfast buffett, which was also good. The hotel had an indoor pool and spa in the top floor as well as some game rooms to play mahjong and cards. The only negative thing I can think of is its location. It's not near a business district nor is it near any tourist attractions. A taxi would most likely be needed. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Dont let name ""Holiday Inn"" fool you-it's fancy! We spent one night here when our adoption agency couldn't get fly everyone into Beijing on the same day. We arrived tired from the San Francisco flight and not sure of what to expect in so exotic a place. We were shocked at how luxurious the hotel was. We went to bed immediately, and the next morning at breakfast we met a number of families adopting through our agency. Adoption was the #1 topic, but right after that came compliments on the hotel itself. Our stay was so short I can't fairly comment on proximity to shopping, or other features such as pool, business center, etc. As far as the rooms, lobby, and breakfast area are concerned, however, we were very pleasantly surprised. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Average hotel out of the center great pool and fitness facilities I stayed in the Vista hotel for 2 nights. I had an (paid) upgrade to the Executive Club while checking in. It offered -among other- a bigger room, free Internet on the room and some free sodas from the minibar each day. Check-in was efficient although staff sometimes has trouble understanding the more difficult questions in English. The room was very spacious and I mean, _very_ spacious. There is a separate bedroom, separate living room. The bathroom is big enough with a bath and a separate large shower. The layout of the room can be a bit confusing and especially the lightning plan was a puzzle sometimes. Be aware that the dates printed on the bottles and cans are production date, not expiration date.The hotel is situated outside of the City center, but taxi's are generally available; a taxi ride from the center to the hotel is approximately 60 RMB. The fitness room as well as the pool are located on the top (21st) floor. Poolsize is average, the fitness room is big with lots of (sometimes) outdated equipment. There are ample TV sets to watch during workout, but you can also look outside en enjoy the view of Shanghai. Openingtimes are 05:30 to 23:00 , which is great. All in all, price/quality is good, although if you'd like to be more in the centre of the action, consider another hotel or rely on taxi's. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Poor Executive Floor Service Overall the hotel is quite OK. The staff at the lobby are friendly and willing to help. The room is clean. The room cleaning maid is full of smile. However, the whole pleasant experience could be stained by one of two service staff. Now the culprit this time are from the Executive Floor service desk: when I was told to check in at upper floor (I think it is 19/F), I went and I met poker faced staff there. (I wonder they might have sent the most terrible staff to Executive Floor so that they will only have limited damage there). I greeted her and said I would like to check in (it was Saturday afternoon around 4:00pm 19th Nov 06). She then tried to find my booking record (but without greeted me back, and not even invited me to sit while she sat comfortably in her Taipan chair....). I reserved a non-smoking floor and she told me I couldn't get it because all non-smoking rooms were occupied. But I booked the room one month ago. Anyway, I am a pretty easy going guy so I didn't bother.The day after (Sunday) I went to the Executive Floor to have my breakfast in the morning. Again, I met another very &quot;special&quot; service staff. She didn't like to move a lot. The reason was &quot;she had a bandage on her knee&quot;. So all her work was passed to a very polite and nice trainee. While this official service staff hide at the staff room kept talking, complained this and complained that, with the door opened. So every one eating breakfast there had to suffer from her big talk. This staff had no smile, no service attitude, not even want to see any guest in the Executive Floor. Alas, such a big contrast to the young and unseasoned trainee (another lady). I guess the hotel might have some management problem so even they could recruit the right people, they could not be trained to be nice.A few days later, another drama. It was in a evening around 8:30pm. I went to Executive Floor with my friend to have a bit of chat of business. The service staff sat there was indeed dating with her boyfriend there. They were talking (argueing) so heatedly that they were smashing the table, shouting to each other. I would say even a 2 star hotel in China would not allow this happening. And now I am talking about an international chained reputatable hotel at its Executive Lounge. I am indeed very very very disappointed. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Nice and Quiet place There are a number of Holiday Inns in Shanghai and so one has to pay attention to the specific name of the Holiday Inn. This Holiday Inn Vista is kinda away from the hustle bustle of the Puxi downtown. Transportation-wise it is not exactly the most convenient (at least 10 mins away from the closest train station and almost an hour away from the airport, and that is if there are no jams on the highways). But exactly because of its exclusive location, one can see more of a real, local Shanghai instead of the heavily-invested, too-glam-to-be-true Pudong/ the Bund in Puxi. It has a good gym, good size pool (and I can't emphasize enough of the gentle sunlight beaming through the roof to land on the swimmers' back... what bliss), a good jacuzzi, a spa center, and good business facilities. The room size and deco are just right. Comfortable and worth the price. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Clean and good standard but nothing special I stayed there during a business trip for 4 nights in the Executive Floor. I found the other reviews a bit overrating compared to what I experienced. The rooms were clean and the rooms well furnished. The floor was not noisy and the beds very comfortable. The normal breakfast room was very crowded every morning and didn´t have enoght seats, especially at the beginning of the week. The breakfast was very good there. The breakfast in the business lounge was, however, very poor. The location is far from the main points of interest and by taxi it is about 15-20 minutes to the Bund and others, but taxis are cheap. There is a big electronic store right opposite the hotel and a Chinese shopping mall some 400 metres down the street, but the area is a bit boring, but safe.I expected a bit more of the hotel, but overall the standard is good and it suits the business traveller´s needs. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,Good service Highly recommended if you have limited budget but want to stay in a hotel with good service &amp; atmosphere in Shanghai city. Not a resort type hotel that has a lot of facilities but it is a business type hotel instead. Only disadvantage is: need to take about 5 min's drive to the nearest subway station. 
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"The Best of our 4-Star Hotel Experiences in China We stayed here for three nights and overall were very pleased with the hotel. The Vista could pass as a 5 star hotel in terms of lobby, room decor, facilities, and breakfast. The pool is EXCELLENT- on the 21st floor, it's a large swimming pool (and you don't need your bathing caps here; can't say that for many pools in China). as well as an adjacent sauna. Most of the staff speaks English to the point where you won't need to know much Chinese. We loved the room's shower as well- in the area of a bathtub, you instead have a shower ring from the ceiling, plus a seating place to rest while you use the hand shower head.Some of the other reviewers said that they missed breakfast- this is a huge mistake. The breakfast is more like brunch- an excellent array of food and drink is available. The food probably is more plentiful in terms of Asian cuisine, but there is a chef on hand to make western eggs, and I saw cereal, Bacon/Sausage each day. Unlike some hotels, there were at least 2 different hot dishes each day (some items are staples, while others vary). I strongly encourage you to have breakfast if you stay here (it was included in our package, which was a weekend rate that I found quite reasonable). Internet service worked flawlessly in our room- it was not cheap, I must say (1 yuan per minute, capped at 100 yuan for 24 hours).This is not to say that the Vista is a perfect place. The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way, but a quick taxi ride brings you to the main tourist areas for a reasonable ($2-3 US?) price. We arrived at night, and our cabbie had some trouble finding the hotel (we had our driver call the hotel and get directions/ cross streets, which thankfully worked out well). Room service was also so-so. The pizza was OK by American standards (at $8 US, it certainly wasn't cheap for this area!). The Singapore noodles we had were completely tasteless- shrimp, squid, other seafood all tasted the same. We ate dinner there once- it was not cheap, food was ok but nothing great, portions were tiny, and bottled water costs at 25-30 yuan ?!? We also were awaken at 7:30 by housekeeping on the first night - ouch; I guess we should have put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; out, but that was still early for a Saturday morning! Our mechanical latch was broken on the door, or at least it didn't seem to work. And You can book this hotel at their website and get a good rate; they promise the lowest internet rates on their site and we found it to be true. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Shanghai. In the lobby I saw that the hotel won some sort of award for &quot;Best Mid Level Business Hotel in Asia.&quot;- I would tend to agree. In fact, we were so impressed with this hotel that we stayed at another Holiday Inn in Beijing (Holiday Inn Downtown, which wasn't up to the Vista's standards but it was OK). "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"A just-OK stay We stayed at the Holiday Inn Vista in mid-July 2006 for 2 nights. A pretty clean hotel, but a little less polished than I'd expected. The color scheme is a little strange both in the lobby and in the rooms. Our room smelled a little funny when we first entered--smelled a little bit like a cleaning solution. Not bad, just took some getting used to. The bed was just OK--not exactly a flat box spring like the standard Chinese-style bed, but not a comfortable mattress either. There was a comfortable topper and nice down pillows on the bed.The room had cable with CNN, but the high speed internet cable was malfunctional in our room. We had to go down to the lobby to use wireless on our laptop, for which we paid a flat rate of 115RMB for a 24-hour pass. Not bad if you plan to use it a few times, but not cheap if you just want to check an email.The staff were professional and did their best to accommodate every request we made. We had problems with the internet at about 11pm and a staff member called one of their IT team to wake them up and get a password for us to use their lobby wireless. We also asked for a room on a higher floor, and they did change us.We didn't eat the breakfast, but we did try a dessert from the lobby bar. My husband took one bite and didn't take another after that. It looked sweet, but wasn't at all. You may expect that at a Chinese food court, but not at a western hotel.The location isn't very convenient at all. It's a 10-minute taxi ride from the nearest subway station (which is Jing An Si). All of the other areas that a tourist would want to visit are a fair distance away by taxi, at LEAST 15-20 minutes everywhere we went. It's just not an ideal location if you want to see the Bund, Pudong, Yuyuan Gardens, the French Concession, and those types of places. Overall, I would not stay here again for the rate we paid (about US$100 for a Deluxe room). I think there are more comfortable hotels with a better location out there for the price we paid. If you don't mind spending the extra time in taxis and you get a good deal on the hotel, it wouldn't be a bad place to stay. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Comfortable hotel Very comfortable room with 2 good size beds. It was impeccably clean and contained all the little extras expected of a good hotel, including iron and board which wasnt always available as standard in chinese hotels.The breakfast was excellent with a good range of western choices and the service was first class both in room and in restaurants.One other poster mentioned staff rushing you, but I think they were just being so attentive that they thought they should clear the plates away as soon as you took your last mouthful. I found the staff very friendly and eager to practice their English! Overall I found the Chinese people to be very friendly.Only downside is the hotel is a bit out of the way, but a 5/10 taxi ride takes you to all the major spots. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"A modern hotel which offers basic comforts We stayed 3 days in this hotel for sightseeing. The location is a bit out of the way from the main attractions, but they are easily assessible via an abundance of taxis. We had a double-bedded room which was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the room amenities were complete. A minor downside was that the bathroom was small for 2 people to be in it at the same time. Buffet breakfast was OK, with a mix of local &amp; western dishes. Service in the restaurant was average but not unfriendly. (We noted that the waitress always seemed to be in a hurry to clear the dishes &amp; cultery from our table without making sure if we were done with them.) Besides breakfast, we did not take any meals in the hotel as the restaurants were expensive. Service was good &amp; friendly in the rest of the hotel. We would book this hotel should we ever return to Shanghai again. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Re : Modern and Comfortable Hotel I stayed in Vista Shanghai a few times for business trip and have come to like this hotel. First the good aspect, this hotel is modern looking with contemporary furniture and the rooms are impeccably clean. I mean really clean, spotless. Right up there with the best 5-star hotel. Not a trace of dirtyness can be found anywhere. The bed is comfortable and in particular, the bathroom is great. Water pressure is strong and there is a overhead rainforest shower that provides a comfortable bath. The bathroom has nice amenities and there is a generous supply of bath and facial towels. However, there is no bath-tub in standard/delux rooms so for those who prefer tubs, take note. The room amenities are complete, everything the business traveller need including abundant powerplugs to charge your &quot;stuff&quot;. A big writing desk and broadband internet. Service is good and friendly though not outstanding. The house-cleaning staff is above-par compare to the rest and are more helpful and friendly. Now the bad aspect, the restaurants in the hotel are very expensive and food quality and selection only so-so, which you can get a much better deal if you visit restaurants outside. Also annoying is the lounge which I received most of my business guest. The lounge insist to &quot;allocate&quot; only 3 cups per tea-pot and if you have more than 3 visitors, good luck, pay for another pot. Location is a problem. For those on leisure, there is nothing to see within walking distance. However, the main shopping districts are just a 15min taxi ride away. I recommend this hotel if you are visiting Shanghai for business and basic comfort like a good rest is important and you can overlook some of its annoying aspects as mentioned above. It is also a very good bargain if you don't mind the location is a bit out of the way. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Very good hotel by any measures Very good modern hotel. I arrived relatively late and they had run out of standard rooms that I had a reservation for so they upgraded me to a suite. The room was very nice (and new). Good professional attitude. No problems with anything.Good choice of food for breakfast. Lobby bar was ok, but the pricing was pretty close to western prices.The location good be a bit better. You have to take taxi wherever you are going. Remember to take the hotel business card with you from the lobby, if you don't speak chinese.A big electronics store on the other side of the street with 5 floors of stuff. "
holiday inn vista shanghai ,"Great room Nice Hotel.After staying at the Ocean &quot; tour groups &quot; hotelthis was a gem.

Staff very courteous.Not central but taxis are cheap. On a main road.A bonus is that a new, just opened European superstote Carrefour is onlya 5 minute walk from the hotel.Never ate in the hotel so i can't comment on the food.but then again, food is so cheap in China who would pay to eat in overpriced hotel restaurants.Would definitely stay here again.

holiday inn vista shanghai ,Positive experience This is a great hotel with nice amenities. Front desk people are very professional and courteous and they speak English! Concierge is very helpful as well. They helped me with directions to go the Bund and to the airport. They even stored our big luggage while we were out on a short trip to Guilin. Breakfast is buffett style but only tastes so-so. Location is not bad although I wish it were closer to the Bund or Nanjing Pedestrian Street. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

hong qiao state guest hotel ,"Beautiful hotel compound This hotel is composed of several different buildings set back from the street in a compound with gardens and trees, so it's very quiet and pretty. Staff and service were excellent and cooperative. They were always ready to answer questions and provide sightseeing advice, though there was one person at the front desk who's English was not up to par. Room was very nice and had a small balcony. While not in the city center, a cheap taxi ride gets you there in 20 minutes or so. Considering the cost savings, it's well worth staying here. "
hong qiao state guest hotel ,"Overrated I think all of the four and five star reviews here are a bit misplaced. This is a decent hotel but nothing special. My room was small and the bed was not that comfortable. The location is far away from the central business area and major tourist attractions and there is no metro within walking distance. The breakfast was OK but again, I've had better. If you want a bargain in Shanghai I recommend New World Mayfair. This place is not that expensive but not very good. "
hong qiao state guest hotel ,"Paradise in Shanghai If you must go to Shanghai, then you must stay at this hotel. Oriental Luxury at an affordable price. I stayed seven days on a business trip and was blown away by the facility. The staff was excellent - very friendly, courteous, and helpful. The rooms were immaculate - I stayed in building two. The ammenities were superb. If you want a quiet, peaceful, gardenlike resort in the middle of a thriving metropolis to relax in, this is the place. There is no doubt about where I will be staying when I returm to Shanghai. "
hong qiao state guest hotel ,"Paradise in Shanghai I’m not going to write about the convenience or amenities of the villas, you can look it up the hotel website I’ve provided. What I’m going to tell you is that of all the international 5 stars hotel I’ve stayed, this one really open up my horizon to luxury and peacefulness in the Shanghai city, and yet you’re only expect to pay the price of a cheap motel of Hongkong. Best feeling, walking down the small road inside the hotel, villas or resort (whatever you call it) and smell the heavenly flower sense, you can’t find it else where in the whole.Thumb up baby. "
hong qiao state guest hotel ,"A quite place to stay Stayed here for the past three nights. The hotel itself is very nice, especially for the price relative to the big American or European chains downtown (i.e. Hilton, Marriott, etc.). The grounds have lots of trees and green. Room are in one of 7 buildings. I stayed in the main building - room 6122. It is about a 20-30 min. taxi ride to &quot;downtown&quot; but if you have business on this side of the city or are going to the domestic HongQiao Airport it can be convenient. A lot of Japanese live in the neighborhoods nearby so after walking about 10 min. you can find quite a few dining choices, especially for Japanese food. The hotel also has several restaurants on site. Room was of ample size and quite clean. High speed internet is available for a small charge. Service is generally good, but not true 5-star. Still I think this hotel represents a good value. "
hong qiao state guest hotel ,"Peacful Oasis Very quiet business hotel about 30 mins from the centre of Shanghai. Set in its own gardens with a seperate health club pool it comprises of a few buildings centred around the main hotel. A lot of Chinese politicians use this hotel and I don't know if just any traveller can stay here because I came on business and our company has an office in the grounds. Very nice, very quiet but not the place to stay if you want to be in the thick of things! "

hotel carolina ,"Terrific value I am from the US and visited Shanghai for about a week. The hotel is geared towards business travelers; the room layout reminded me of Hyatt's back in the states. Room amenities were top notch, as was service. The location was terrific as well. Overall, very good value. "
hotel carolina ,"Hotel Carolina has everything you need for a comfortable stay Hotel Carolina is on Xinhua Road in Shanghai, which is West of the downtown, Pudong area. Because it is not downtown is is very reasonably priced. I stayed there for a week with some class mates I was taking a course at the Economics school with. The school is about a 5 min. walk away, it was perfect. The metro station West Yan'an rd. is about 10 min. walk. The hotelwas impecably clean, the staff very freindly and the rooms are beautiful. There is AC and internet in every room. each room also has a bar fridge which is nice. The free breakfast is great. AS variety of Chinese food and toast, fruit, coffee, cereal area avail. There are computers with internet in the buiness centre. I can't say anough about how pleased I ws about this place. It is a great value and the service is excellent. Btw if you area a runner it is close to a great park for running called zhongshan park. Go early if you do. Zongshan has a loop trail that is popular with the locals. It isn't a really long loop, but it is much better than running on the sidewalk in full sun. "
hotel carolina ,"Pleasant stay and would definitely come here again! It was overall a great get-away from everything. It's located in the Chang Nan District of Shanghai... It is within a reasonable distance from most places (20 mins away by taxi). The room was clean and cozy and I loved the bathroom the most! The showers were a comfortable pressure... and they had two shower heads! One is fixed and acts as a rainshower, and the other one is a detachable shower head so that's pretty neat. The toilet was probably one of the better ones I've seen in China for awhile. I honestly didn't pay attention to the beds because for the 3 nights I've stayed here, I slept immediately since I had quite an exhausting travel schedule. There's a driveway and gate that leads you towards the hotel... The hotel is actually 30 meters away from the street so you can imagine how quiet it is. There was absolutely NO NOISE from the streets. There are two convenience stores at both ends of the streets. By the way, the hotel is located near the middle of the street, so no intersections to worry about either. Catching a cab was quite easy as well, as many vacant ones pass by the road quite frequently.The continental breakfast won't make you full but the food's decent, and gives you enough energy to survive until lunchtime. What else is there... Ah yes, places to suggest a foreigner should definitely visit. Of course, the Wai Tan area, and check out Cheng Huang Miao which is a great place to checkout some neat architecture and buy some local goodies, souvenirs, etc... For cheap bargains go to Qing Pu Lu - i bought some ridiculously cheap Giorgio Armani / Burberry London ties for 30 RMB... comes with matching cufflinks and pocket sleeves.. If I gave it to someone as a gift, the person would not even suspect that it would be a replica because it looks that real (maybe it is real?). Anyway, this hotel rocks and I definitely would return again! "

hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Enjoyed our stay at this great hotel We stayed here for a couple of nights as part of a tour group. From our room on the tenth floor, we had a great view of the city. Included with our room was a buffet breakfast with both western and Chinese food. The place is conviently located and there is a large shopping mall within walking distance. We enjoyed lunch in one of its restaurants, E Cafe, which reminded us somewhat of Starbucks and had pastries and sandwiches along with excellent coffee and tea. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Enjoyable hotel but was subject to loud nightly construction noise We stayed at the Equatorial Hotel from May 20-23, and were very aware of the loud construction noise outside of our hotel window. Regardless of what the General Manager said in the previous post, the whole front of the hotel was subject to this noise.We tolerated it for the beginning of our stay, but the noise during the last night was so loud that neither my husband or I was able to sleep. On the positive side, when we notified the front desk we were immediately transferred to another room on our floor that faced another direction and was quiet.Another issue about the hotel was the internet access. We did not have our own computer, so went to the Business Center to use their computers to access our email.They charge for 15 minute segments of time online, but the system was so slow that we didn't even get online for 20-25 minutes. We finally did get on, but the system was so slow that we ended up paying for an hour of time.We were staying at this hotel as part of a &quot;China Sampler&quot; trip on SmarTours. We really enjoyed Shanghai. This hotel had a very nice breakfast, with a large array of food choices for all types of tastes. They had the best eggroll that I ever tasted, as well as good dim sum and omelets for breakfast. The hotel is walking distance from Nanjing Road, which is an interesting and lively shopping street. We actually took a walk there and did some shopping (&quot;window only&quot; as the prices were very high.)We were amazed at the size of Shanghai and the millions of people and cars that were there. It was a very modern city with lots of interesting sights. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Nice hotel pity about the roadworks I spent one night at this hotel while in Shanghai for business. The hotel is well kept, elegant and comfortable. The rooms are not huge, but look fantastic and there is an acceptable number of English language channels on the TV.Unfortunately, even at my request for a quiet room, I was put in a room facing the main road which had road works operating from 8pm onwards (on a Sunday night). The windows did little to keep out the noise of jackhammers and construction vehicles and as a result I got very little sleep.The other main downside is the expensive internet acces which is unacceptable for a hotel with a business traveller slant.The hotel itself is quite a long way from the main entertainment/shopping district and &quot;the Bund&quot; - a taxi will be needed.If you can get a quiet room this would be quite an acceptable hotel to stay in. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Doubt I Will Stay Again There is nothing particularly wrong with Equatorial but I couldn’t wait to get out of there. No complaints about the room or the bathroom with small add-ons that matter, like toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, a tea pot, or a safe deposit box. There is a swimming-pool and a gym, both 6am-11pm. But this is where niceties end.The hotel staff has an aura of misery: no one is really helpful and forget smiles. Breakfast looks like a lot of variety but hardly anything tastes nice whether it is Western, Chinese, or sushi. Hotel has quite a few restaurants and bars but all are overpriced and lack the ambiance. Free WiFi is provided almost in all cafes on the premises but loud music makes it hard to work. Laundry service and in-house beautician are very pricy.I didn’t like the hotel at all. The building was ugly, breakfast tasteless, and what mattered most was the staff attitude. Will try to find something different for my next stay. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"central location in Shanghai I stayed at the Equatorial for 1st 2weeks in December 2008. The hotel is immaculately clean and staff very helpful.I stayed on the 26th Floor and had access to the lounge - the extra 100RMB was worth it if you used it, complimentory tea/coffee all day, complimentory breakfast (normally 128 RMB) complimentory snacks 3.30 - 5.30 pm (very nice!) complimentory drinks + local beer 5.30 - 7.30 pm and free selection of daily papers. For the business users the lounge also offers broadband and pc access although WiFi is available (signal weak and tempremental on floor 26)the 'entertainment' in the cafe lounge consisted of a live singer accompanied by piano may be ok for some but not to my taste - i much preferred the live music on the top floor at the Hilton next door if i was to tell the truth, also being 12 floors higher the views are better as well.The 'golden question' is would i stay there again Honestly - i would if i had to as there is nothing wrong with the hotel but there is nothing that would make me make it first choice "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,Good quality hotel Good quality hotel that ticked all the boxes for a business hotel. Restaurants and bars were good services was excellent. 
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Credit card malpractice I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. But what transpired after has completely changed my opinion.On checkout, I paid by credit card. The hotel bills were in RMB, and the “TOTAL:” mentioned on the credit card bills were also in RMB. I expected to see the amount appear on my credit card bill in RMB, which my bank would then convert to Euro (my base currency) at that day's rate of 9.072284. Instead, when I received my credit card bill, I found to my horror that the hotel had billed me directly in Euros, at a *lower rate* of 8.889. And on top of that, my credit card company charged a foreign transaction charge, which is of course as per the T&amp;M. I contacted the hotel, and the manager wrote back saying that I paid in Euro. Ha! What a smart way to make extra money. If indeed the frontdesk person wanted to charge in Euro, she should have made that explicitly clear. She should have asked me before charging me in Euro. This malpractice on the part of a 5* hotel is very sad and ended up costing me a lot of money because of the conversion diff.So stay away from this hotel, or be careful about such credit card frauds. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"good hotel but not close to subway. Large modern hotel. Efficient check-in. Most staff spoke English. Rooms were large and bathroom modern and clean. Complimentary terry robes, slippers, water, tea and coffee. Housekeeping staff very helpful. We ordered room service one night...pizza and salad. It was pretty good and service was quick.Location was not as central as we hoped..about 10 minutes away by cab to French Concession. On the last day we discovered some nice shopping areas within walking distance from the hotel. Not near any subway and was a long taxi ride to the Bund as the traffic was always terrible. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Perfect location classy 4 star hotel The Equatorial in Shanghai is part of the Malaysian chain and in a perfect location, just minutes via fly-over to the Jing'an Temple and West Nanjing Rd. You are minutes via cab to all the main attractions, such as East Nanjing Rd, People Sq and Huahai Rd. Rooms are well decorated, modern decor and with all the mod cons. We were upgraded to a club room, which are the same as the deluxe rooms, but on the highest floors. You wont get club lounge access if you get upgraded incidentally! Breakfast is great, as is the fitness centre, but hotel guests can only use the pool, you have to pay 150RMB p/p if you want to use the Jacuzzi. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,Great 4 star This is a well located 4 star which is trying really hard to please. I was upgraded to the Equatorial Club floor this time (my second visit) and - while the separate check in and dedicated breakfast were nice - I wouldn't extra pay for this. Promised complimentary cocktails turned out to be a choice between orange juice and beer! The food in several locations I tried was all good and the staff universally attentive. Its not 5 star but then the prices aren't either. Trying really hard - a good effort under a British Gemeral Manager who seems to have his fingers on the pulse. 
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Perfect mix of Value location and great accomodations Stayed in two rooms in the Equatorial in March, 2008 for 6 nights with my wife and two boys, ages 10 and 12. The price was pretty good. The view in our rooms was not bad. You could see a great distance but not much in the way of seeing any landmarks. The windows open which was nice to get fresh air. We thought the location was great. First we could walk to the French concession and we also took a long walk all the way to the Bund. There is an easy crosswalk over the highway that takes you right across the street to a gorgeous park. In that park is a stunning polonician resturaunt. Through the park is the entrance to the Metro.Each night I went merely around the block and found several local noodle shops, and other nice little resturants. The breakfast buffet was pretty good every morning with eastern and western foods.We used the pool and spa several times. Both were nicer than I even expected. The pool has a great view of the fascinating Shanghai traffic flow on the expressway. They are currently updating the spa but it was quite nice to begin with. There is a squash court and a tennis court. Finally, the workout facilities are excellent. We did so much great walking however that we didn't use it until our last day. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Excellent hotel good location I stayed here for a fair in Shanghai but did a little bit of sightseeing as well. The hotel is very nicely decorated, rooms have air conditioning, all toiletries (including toothbrush, razor) and complimentary drinking water delivered daily.The hotel is a short walk to the underground train which can take you into the main hub of Shanghai. There is plenty of shopping malls and restaurants close by too and if you are interested can purchase DVD's (in english) for around 5RMB each (around 80 cents) on the overpass outside the hotel. There are also toys, bags, jewellery etc depending on the time of day and weather.Buffet breakfast was good and had a good selelction of chinese/western foods. The desigh your own omelettes were great! There is a small gift shop in the hotel lobby (they had really cute panda toys in red silk vests for around $80RMB) there is also a tour desk and money-changing facility.As my boss and I were travelling with locals who work for our company, we got chauffered around the town and cannot remember the name of the place, but there is a huge indoor market with everything you can imagine. I picked up some awesome fake handbags for around $30AUD each which are the best copies i've ever seen. There is also clothes, jewellery, wigs, a lot of Mont Blanc pen sets (you shouldn't pay more than about 30RMB ($5AUD) for these as we picked them up 4 sets for 100RMB)All in all, a very comfortable hotel in a great location for shopping and the train. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,Great Hotel at a Good Price I recently stayed at the Equatorial Hotel in Shanghai after it was recommended to me. The hotel was great when we arrived the hotel was full on the normal hotel floors and because we have booked a Deluxe Room we were immediately accommodated on the Club Floor. The rooms have recently undergone a refurbishment and are very clean and tidy. On my second stay a week later we were accommodated on the normal hotel room floors and the room on those floor was very tidy and clean. The hotel reception were more than helpful. The breakfasts were great catering for all tastes. This hotel is very tailored towards business people and caters well for westerners. There are restaurants nearby behind the City Plaza Shopping Centre which are all very reasonably priced. There are restaurants in the hotel but they are a little more expensive. Better to experience the food outside the hotel. I would definately stay in this hotel again should I come back to Shanghai. 
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Shanghai comfort Entering through the doors of this hotel let's you escape from the frantic activity this fantastic city thrives upon. It's very modern, like much of Shanghai now is. It's run very efficiently. The rooms are of a medium size, very clean and have three pin &quot;english&quot; type electric points. Mine didn't have much of a view. I guess I was on the wrong side of the building.The pool, and the upstairs bar are both quite quiet, and both look out at the constant throng of traffic going past. Though you can't hear any of it.The ground floor lounge bar is quite busy early evening, before people head out into the city to explore Shanghai by night.Would I stay here again? Yes.Would I recommend it to anyone else? Absolutely. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Excellent 4 Star Hotel I ahve stayed here twice, both for business. I found the hotel to be convenient, close to local shops and restuarants. Walking around the hotel, especially if you go left at the entrance and walk about 1km up the road you get into a residential area where you will find markets, street stalls and family restaurants. This is China, not the western style restuarants you see in central and elsewhere. Nearby there are also a number of up market pubs and western style restaurants....not easy to find.The rooms are spacious and well kept, inkeeping with a 4 star hotel in Asia. Its location is not the best but taxis are cheap. During peak periods go along the highway and pick up the taxi, there is normally a long quene at the hotel and the busboys are not very good at calling the taxis from the street( my only complain)Otherwise I recomend this hotel for most experienced traveller. if you need the pampering of the Four Seasons, don´t come here. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Great Near-Top Tier Hotel at Good Value The Equatorial is a great, next-to-top tier hotel, with terrific Western standard service, a great location, and all the features of the top-tier hotels. The heatlh spa and pool are terrific, rooms are of a decent size, and there is a large variety of restaurants.The hotel seems to attract many Asian clients, as Equatorial is a Malaysian chain, so you're not spending your time in Shanghai surrounded by westerners. If Western company is what you want, head for the Hilton next door.The location is close to the Metro, has a nice park across the street, and an easy walk to Hengshan Lu and its restaurants and bars. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"China syndrome. Stayed here night of 10th June. Breakfast: Ordered fried egg which never arrived despite talking to manager at the time. Coffee only poured when I drew attention to myself. Staff too busy yawning and talking amongst themselves. Must have been too early for them (6.45am) . No smiles! Then mentioned this to duty manager at reception who nodded wisely and carried on talking to Chinese friend. Plus side, food does taste good, rooms are clean and well serviced. Suggestion: free mineral (not distilled) water in small bottles for guests. Essentially this is a good hotel but staff still need supervision. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"My favourite hotel in Shanghai I have stayed in several hotels in Shanghai and across China, and this is my all-time favourite. The rooms were immaculate, the staff seem genuinely friendly. A couple of them even remembered me by name from a previous stay - this personal touch made all the difference. The food is excellent, the breakfast buffet is by far the best and widest ranging buffet catering to all tastes. Even the coffee (a rarity in China) is good.On my last stay at the end of May 07, the hotel had a good offer on one of their executive suites. Again, I was most pleasantly surprised. A three room suite with all mod-cons, including little touches such as scales to weigh your luggage on, bedside alarm clock, desk lamp, etc. Previously I have stayed in their standard rooms however they are by no means any lower in standard and quality. Plus the recent refurbishment of the hotel has lifted its image further.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering staying in Shanghai. All the staff can speak at least conversational English, even the concierge and bell-hops.I am surprised this hotel hasn't been rated as 5-star, as it certainly merits it. I have stayed at 5-star hotels which are not nearly as good as this one.Keep up the good work Equatorial! "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"good hotel I stayed at this hotel while on a study abroad trip with a group from my university.This is a solid 4 star hotel, with all that entails. The only negative I can think of is that there are no real restaurants within walking distance. The location is not the best. I personally prefer to be in a center of sorts where I can walk to a restaurant and bar and stumble home after a long day.The lobby is nice and grand. Breakfast is good. The room is clean, nice and a decent size. Bathroom is fine with hansgrohe fixtures which I respect since I have them at home. The beds are very comfortable with fluffy down comforters. They are on the narrow side. Our room has 2 twin beds. The decor is asian contemporary. We have expansive floor to ceiling windows which afford us a fabulous view of the city. Room 1112 has a great view.The hotel has a spa which we will partake of later today. It is very reasonably priced. It also has a pool, small jacuzzi, steam and sauna. They give us free bottles of h2o daily. We have to pay for the internet in the hotel, although it was advertised to be free.happy travels "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,great find we were walk inns of the street as we checked out of another hotel we got a great rate for executive room suite &lt;seperate lounge and bedroom with 2 toilets&gt; room was spacious and importantly clean. partner was sick for 2 days and the staff were fantastic in helping get medicines etc. looked at the hilton next door initially tiny rooms there. was a heftier price tag also so we felt this was a great find. comfortble soft bed also! 
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Disappointing service The food in the restaurant is very disappointing. The ingredients are not fresh, and there tends to be an aftertaste of crab even in dishes that don't have it, e.g., sliced fruit. The waiters drag their feet when they walk, and have a habit of taking things away from your table just when the spoon is making its way to your mouth. I find the atmosphere disruptive to proper dining.The customer service at the business center and the duty manager's station is very poor. I'm not sure how much of this can be attributed to the language barrier since they cannot communicate very well in English. I did not get assistance despite having asked for it. The commands in their programs (e.g., Microsoft Word) are in Chinese, so it was very difficult to get any work done.They change the bedsheets every day but once in a while we get one that has a shoeprint on it.Also, when I borrowed an ironing board, housekeeping gave me one that was missing a leg. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Decent hotel noisy renovation work Decent hotel, mainly aimed at business people. Excellent staff who speak good English. Just a little further away from some sights such as The Bund, Nanking Street than other hotels but that yields benefits of easier access to other areas and gives those who chose to walk downtown more of an experience. Easy and cheap to get taxis....even all the way out to Pudong was rarely much more than 50 RMB (but make sure you get a state owned taxi using a meter)Excellent reception and front door staff, very efficient room cleaners. Room was immaculate in all respects and well up to usual &quot;International&quot; business class. Choice of restaurants and decent buffet, lounges and residents facilities on 4th floor including bar with live music each night...except Monday!Only problem during my stay, was the renovation work which I was unaware of when booked. Substantial (it must be judging by the noise) renovation work on 16th and above floors. I was only on 14th floor but from 9.00AM until 7.00PM constant hammer drilling and banging, literally non-stop, every day. It sounded so loud I thought it was coming from the room next door. Also, it was not exceptionally hot outside but for some reason I just could not get the AC to bring the room down to a decent sleeping temperature. I asked the front desk to investigate it and went out, assuming they had checked it but there was no improvement.Would I stay there again.? Probably Yes, as the price was good too but I would check on the renovation work first. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Nice hotel This hotel mainly caters for business people but it is a nice enough hotel and not too expensive. It doesn't have the best views of the city, but it is in a nice part of town, within walking distance of all the designer malls and close to a metro stop and a temple and near some good bars. The staff all speak good English, the rooms were clean and a good size, there is a pool and breakfast runs quite late and is a decent buffet (consists of Chinese dumplings, eggs any way you like, fruit, yogurts, cereals, croissants, bacon...). We enjoyed our stay here and found it easy to get around the city from this hotel. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Buyer Beware Shanghai: Hotel Equatorial Hotel-Shanghai: &quot;Buyer Beware&quot;Date: March, 2nd, 2006Reviewer: Jenny, Seattle, USAMy sister-in-law who lives in Shanghai booked this hotel one month ahead of my arrival date through a local agency called Elong. She called to confirm for me a day before. When I got to the airport and realized my flight will be delayed for two hours. I called her again from airport. She phoned Elong and was told that room will be held for us until 6:00am next day. All the check-in information was also on paper faxed by Elong. When my boyfriend and I got to the hotel to check in around midnight, the receptionist looked at the paper and said this reservation has been cancelled since we showed up late and didn't call and the bad news was that they sold out for that night. I demanded to talk to the manager and he basically repeated same thing as receptionist told us. After a long day flight at 1:00am in Shanghai, we didn't have our room. Fortunately I have family in Shanghai. My dad phoned Peace Hotel and we got one room there around 2:00am. Believe or not,that date was my boyfriend's 40th birthday.We planned that way to be more exciting. Instead we were exhausting. But but but this is not end of the story. My sister-in-law was so furious that she called Elong next day. She was more furious when she was told by Elong that we never went to hotel to check in. The hotel lied to Elong. That means Elong will still charge one night from her credit card. At that point my boyfriend and I decided to go the hotel again to confront the manager. We didn't only after we found out Elong decided not to charge one night on my sister-in-law's account. Later on we found out Shanghai had been so popular that many 4 or 5 stars hotels in good location were not easy to book. Most of them were overbooked. We were told in JW Marriot that they were overbooked by 20 rooms when we checked in the day after. My advice to anybody who travel there is to call the hotel yourself on the arrival date and tell them your arrival time even you book the hotel through Hotel or Expedia or any other web site. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Comfortable well-appointed I unfortunately have no comparison to other hotels in Shanghai, but upon approach of the Hotel Equatorial you can feel that you're walking into comfort. The lobby is beautiful with its high 2-story ceiling, marble floors, &amp; accented lighting. Service is friendly &amp; efficient. There seemed to be a lot of foreign tourists &amp; business travelers so I assume the staff is well-spoken in English. All in all the staff was at all times helpful, efficient, &amp; professional. The rooms are sized fairly well, but the bathrooms weren't much to boast about. The linens, at least, were crisp. There are a number of restaurants &amp; lounges inside the hotel to relax. There are a few gift shops to browse and they offer currency exchange, a business center, etc. All things that make a good hotel worth the stay.The breakfast at the Equatorial is renowned &amp; well worth its own paragraph description. The seating in the breakfast area is spacious &amp; open with coffee table-service. All the food is served buffet style -- and what a buffet it is. Both Western &amp; Asian style cuisine is offered...in fact more Western choices than Asian. The selection includes a congee bar, omelette table (made to order in front of you), fresh fruits, baked goods, yogurts, cold cuts, eggs/bacon/sausage, etc. It was immense &amp; wonderful. The atmosphere of the whole place at the Hotel Equatorial is modern-grand &amp; tasteful -- a miniature embodiment of everything Shanghai is today as an international modern metropolis. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Good mid range hotel easy access location Hotel is large, over 20 storeys high and is located on the western end of the Yan'an Road. Rooms are large, standard for a good business type hotel. Bathroom spotlessly clean, however slightly dated. Lobby bar needs redecorating but staff are pleasant. Large buffet style breakfast, same restaurant also does buffet lunch and dinner. Chinese and Steakhouse restaurants also in hotel. Taxi to the Bund or to Nanjing Road around Eur2-3. Hotel is just north of French Connession area, great location for bars, restaurants and shopping. Good mid range hotel, good deals available, location good for access to city centre. Recommended. "
hotel equatorial shanghai ,Excellent Hotel I have stayed in this hotel twice. It is first class with excellent food. The choice for breakfast is wonderful and if you try only a quarter of the options you will hardly need to eat another thing for the rest of the day. 
hotel equatorial shanghai ,"Very Comfortable Friendly but efficient staff. Beds, bedlinen and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. Breakfast excellent, catering for Western and Asian tastes with a chef on hand to cook lovely eggs and omelettes with ingredients of your choice. Huge swimming pool and good facilities. Hotel a little away from the Bund, but taxis to anywhere of note only cost about 20 yuan, (about 1 pound sterling), so not a problem. Apart from well stocked little shops, they also had an all day bakery where you could buy yummy cakes etc, such a good idea when you only need a snack on the run and not room service. Side rooms at the hotel from my nineteenth room floor gave a view of the Pearl Tower. Rates are also reasonable for this standard of hotel. "

hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"You get what you pay for This hotel is your standard Ibis hotel located in Pudong. A good 20 minute walk away from the nearest metro station, but it does have two shopping areas next door with good restaurants, Starbucks, Carrefour supermarket etc. It is a long way from the tourist attractions however.Usual Ibis room with tiny bathroom (shower, toilet, basin) and room with bed and desk up against the window. Small flat screen TV with only a couple of English channels (ESPN, Bloomberg and CCTV English channel).Despite other reviews saying the beds are hard, I can say it is not as hard as the bed I've had to sleep on since moving to China! In fact it felt positively soft! However, it is probably much harder than most westerners are used to. I felt a better job could have been done with the cleaning. The shower hadn't been cleaned properly (mould in corners, along edges and around the plug hole) and it got progressively worse over the days we stayed. There was a lot of noise overnight (we were on the 11th floor) that woke me up several times each night - people shouting, car alarms constantly going off and fireworks. The people staying in the room above us were up most of the night as well and I could hear them walking around.The staff were not overly friendly or helpful. There was free internet available in rooms, but in the evening it slowed to almost dial up speed.If you can put up with the noise, distance from everything and things being a bit rough around the edges then this is a cheap hotel in an expensive city. However next time, I think I'd pay more for something in a better location and for a better experience. "
hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"Excellent IBIS standard as usual We checked-in at this hotel after one night at White Mansion Hotel (Bai Sha Hotel) and we were not dissapointed with our change of hotel. The room and service were great as usual on IBIS hotels and we enjoyed our stay here. Especially, we appriciated the service level by the staff who spoke English and always were very helpful. But we also liked the district of the hotel , the cleaniness and the breakfast. The hotel is a good choice in Shanghai. "
hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"OK except lacking in room amenities 1) Cleaniness: room was clean, no complaints.2) Location: located just opposite Thumbs Plaza in Pudong, which is convenient as there is plenty of restaurants and a Carrefour just across the street. It is a little walk to the nearest metro station, but getting a cab is convenient. Thus, location is not bad if you are active mostly on the Pudong side, as cab fares for a few trips to Puxi side can easily make up for the low price of this hotel. 3) Room: the room is small and basic. There is no fridge, no safe, no hairdryer, no iron and ironing board, no tissue, paper cups were provided instead of the usual glass cups, and u have to bring ur own shower gel and shampoo. We did ask for a hairdryer from the reception but were informed for both days we were there that they have all been loaned out. Bed as hard as rock. 4) Service: slightly better than typical chinese hospitality.5) Value: if you can make do with what is lacking and a really hard bed, then it is an acceptable price to pay for an international brand name and clean basic rooms. "
hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"A clean budget check-in check-out hotel Stayed here for 2 nights due to emergency repairs at my apartment. This hotel was a typical ibis hotel (similar to those in France near the highways). It was surely a budget hotel and had nothing to be savoured by the means of hotel facilities (a check-in, finish what needs to be done in Shanghai and check-out). The bed was clean and comfy but the &quot;sofa/bench&quot; was HEAVILY stained so I kept well away from that. The bathroom was a signature ibis prefabricated module type, had a Grohe shower head and sufficient water pressure. I asked for a non-smoking room, but the front desk replied that they don't specifically differentiate between non-smoking/smoking rooms. Fortunately I stayed in a room that didn't reek of smoke. There was free internet and free parking too.There are great shops and restaurants near by. It’s also very close to the international exhibition centre. I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you're on a shoe string budget or quick business trip. "
hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"Very good value clean comfortable This is a new hotel with the latest Ibis rooms to the standard french design. Small modular bathroom with good big shower. Queen size bed, faux timber flooring, desk against window and small couch and wardrobe. (See photo on hotel website). Free broadband internet with ethernet cable in room. Some international TV stations, inc HBO, Bloomberg and French TV, but curiously not BBC or CNN. The Ibis is located some distance out in Pudong, not far from the Maglev station to Pudong airport. Metro station about 1.5km away (take a taxi), but the outdoor mall- Thumb Plaza is opposite. It has a Carrefour hypermarket and big range of restaurants, bars and cafes as well as Bank of China. Good asian breakfast with limited western choice, but you can get toast, croissants, fruit and coffee for 20RMB. A pleasant bar as well. Good management and friendly desk staff. If price is a consideration and you want a comfortable, very clean international standard hotel with free internet and international TV, then this is the hotel for you in Shanghai. "
hotel ibis shanghai lianyang ,"Ok only. But I don't think I'll stay there again. 1. Getting there: Good thing we printed out the name and address of the hotel in Chinese because Shanghai is enormous and the taxi driver would never be able to find this place without the address. Even with the address a few taxi drivers drove right past. We had to point out the &quot;ibis&quot; sign. But the hotel is like, off the main road, down a driveway. So it's not easy to find.2. Checking in: HAHA they don't speak English. The whole time we were there, only one manager spoke and understood English well enough for us to have a coherant conversation. That said, between hubby and I, we do speak a little halting Mandarin and I could definitely say that it was still better than the staff's English.So the check-in was a bit slow. And they gave us a smoking room though we did request non-smoking when we made our reservation. Their response was that the hotel is new so the cigarette smell wouldn't be noticeable. WRONG!! But because it was so hard to communicate, we just bared with it. But NEVER AGAIN.The bellboy showed us to our room. And *shock horro* it was occupied. So he left us in the corridor to find a new room.3. Amenities and facilities: Bathroom amenities were just the toothbrush, unknown brand toothpaste, and some soap and shampoo. Bring or buy your own stuff. Their stuff is probably like the cheapest you can find anywhere. They have free internet downstairs BUT haha I couldn't work out how to work the computer. The typing all came out as Chinese writing!!!Oh yeah, the free broadband in the room for your computer was good. I think that's why I chose this hotel, coz of the free internet. Others were charging ridiculous amounts for broadband.4. Restaurant: The breakfast was RMB20 per person which is super cheap but expect to get what you pay for. Being very unadventurous as far as food goes, I didn't try most of the things there and there really wasn't very much there for you to choose from either. Porridge, fruit, salad, some dumplings (that didn't taste nice) and oily, salty fried noodles. Juice. I only ate there once. It was enough..5. Location. Ok location. There's a big shopping centre across the road. Carrefour. Many restaurants, though I would say the restaurants are kind of expensive there. But to get to the attractions and into town, it was a bit of a hassle. No train within walking distance, we'd take a taxi to the nearest train station. The taxi was about RMB20. Not too expensive. Just a hassle.Taxi to town was about RMB40. Taxi back from town was RMB65. More expensive coz the taxi would have to make a huge round. Take the train to the science centre stop and take a taxi from the taxi stand there.6. The room: Small, with lots of corners that you can stub your toes on. Didn't like the smoking room smell. But I suppose that's subjective, right? Tiny little bathroom cubicle, which I assume is standard with Ibis hotels. The shower leaked a lot of water into the bathroom and so the bathroom floor was freezing cold all night.Overall ok for the price. I paid RMB245 per night. Very cheap for a room in Shanghai. But next time I think I'll stay at Novotel Atlantis or Sofitel Hyland. I ate at both hotels and prefered the locations. Didn't like having to take taxi everywhere. "

hotel yun s paradise ,"Worth staying and check out the Harvest Moon restaurant Initially we were not sure when we booked this hotel and our fears were not helped by the lack of correct inforamtion provided by the hotel on subway lines and how to find them.This was further complicated during our stay as the hotel staff were friendly but seemed to not have much useful local knowledge or the information was wrong. Usually they just recommended taking a taxi thereby passing the problem on to someone else!The rooms in the hotel are large, but the walls are thin so you can often hear your neighbours.We stayed at the hotel twice as we did a brief visit to Xi'an and the hotel allowed us to store our luggage for free which meant we only had to take what we needed for a short trip - which was excellent.On our return they upgraded us to a larger room with a tub. Next to the hotel is a restaurant called the Harvest Moon that is worth checking out.The bar of the hotel also allows you to buy a voucher and then it is all inclusive drinks in the bar - it is well worth it.Breakfast at the hotel is plentiful with lots of choice. "
hotel yun s paradise ,"optimal business hotel Location, setup, facilities, prices, all make for a perfect place to do business. great value and excellent food.Each time, we have stayed for a few days and run a number of client seminars in the conference rooms.Staff are great - right out of 4-seasons training, access to local life (even if it; just a walk &amp; ferry to Pudong is adjacent), and the metro is just 4 minutes walk so one doesn't have to use the very variable Shanghai taxis. "
hotel yun s paradise ,"Nice and good hotel the location is very good, only 100 meters away from the Shanghai Yu garden. Clean and comfortable. The food at the lobby restaurant is specialized in seafood, fresh and delicious! "

hotel yun s paradise ,"Very pleased as usual!! This is our second two week long stay at this hotel in Shanghai. We are extremely pleased with the exceptional service and wonderful breakfast, and super accomodating staff. Across the street from the Old City, very convienient and very close by taxi to Bund and other attractions. We will be staying there again very soon. "
hotel yun s paradise ,"Don't bother I stayed at Yun's Paradise last weekend with 3 other friends. The hotel is below average in almost every aspect: Location: whilst the hotel is located near the Bund and XinTianDi, (only 5-10 mins away by taxi), it is also located at the intersection of a highway. Cars coming only from ONE direction can make a stop at the hotel. During our stay, we took about 4 taxi rides back to the hotel, and every time we had to stop somewhere near the hotel and walked back. There is no subway station near the hotel. Room: the bed is quite comfortable, and the room is of a decent size. However the room is VERY dim due to inadequate lighting. Service: the front desk is hands down the worst that I've ever encountered in my whole adult life. On two occasions I asked them for directions to two famous restaurants in Shanghai. Not only did they not know anything about the restaurants, they also refused to call the restaurants up for me (i had the number), telling me instead to make the call myself. Business Center: when we walked into the business center one night to use the internet, we found two staff member slouching against the wall smoking cigarettes. No wonder the room smelled so bad. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody. "
hotel yun s paradise ,"Not Paradise but a nice place still... We decided to try this hotel as the price and location seemed good. In fact, all rooms were freshly renovated and the decoration looked &quot;retro&quot; but gadgets were modern (sensor light switches, LCD flat screen mounted on wall, etc...). Broadband internet was free as in most 3 star hotels across China. The bathroom was not roomy in our piece and we had to use the top of the toilet tank for personal toiletries. We could not ascertain if other room types were better. The location is a little far (by foot) to city center. There was a lot of construction going nearby. If you learn how to move in city buses, it is cheap &amp; convenient: for ¥2 you can reach Nanjing Street, People's Square, The Bund, and once you reach a metro station you are solved! The closest attraction was Yu''s Garden at 5 minute walking range. Service was &quot;not exceptional&quot; and smiles were not free. There is room for improvement but &quot;overall&quot; it was above standard for a hotel in a big city like Shanghai. "

house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Unscrupulous Management! BEWARE WHEN BOOKING DIRECT WITH HOTEL!!! MANAGEMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUS! DO NOT DIVULGE YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS TO THEM! We had to turn back from Llhasa due to the riots and found ourselves in Shanghai. We called Old House Inn on the day we arrived (Friday) to check if they had any last minute rooms available for Friday to Sunday. After being informed that the hotel was fully booked for Friday, the receptionist Nicky said she would get back on availability for Sat and Sun as somebody may be cancelling his booking. We then made arrangements to stay with a friend when she called back (Friday evening) and said they had a room available for both nights but that we would have to change rooms. I made the mistake of giving the hotel my credit card details as a guarantee, thinking that it was a reputable place from all the reviews I read on the internet. On Saturday morning, however, we thought that we might as well stay put at our friend’s place and called to check if we could cancel our reservation. We were told that it was not a problem and that I would not be charged for it. On Monday afternoon, however, as we were waiting for our flight back to Singapore, I received a call from the hotel, “a courtesy call to inform you that we will be charging you a full night’s rate for your cancellation”. That was certainly all the courtesy I received from them, having had the phone slammed down on me when I tried to explain that I was told earlier that there would be no cancellation fee. Upon reaching home, I called my credit card company to check if there was a charge made by Old House Inn, or a hotel in Shanghai, on or after Mar24. No, I was informed and told not to worry since I did not give the hotel the security number on my credit card. When I received my credit card bill, needless to say, I was shocked to find a charge of RMB1030 on Mar24 to, not the Old House Inn, but to Laoshiguang Restaurant! My credit card company now says that the money has been paid to them and it is up to the hotel whether they want to give me a refund, especially since everything was done over the phone. The hotel apparently has phone records, which they quote in support of their argument, but when I asked them to check on the second call I made they seem to have no record or memory of it. It is one thing to be charged a cancellation fee, and another to be told that there would be no charge and to later be charged the full room rate for “no show” and to be told by the hotel manager I have no choice about the matter!

house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Lovely and peaceful hotel and neighbourhood A very private, calm and peaceful house with excellent exterior and interior design. The service is personal, helpful and warm. Two minutes walk across Chashu Road, there are lovely restaurants and bars. Walking inside the small streets away from the main road near the restaurants will lead you to some very interesting residential house built around 1920. Ten minutes walk to Jing An Park and Temple, best visited in the earlymorning around 7:30 a.m. Walking around Jing An Temple will let you see many nice building of 1920's - one of the best experience for my visit in Shanghai. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Great Litlle Boutique Hotel We wanted an alternative to the megachain hotels, and our first choice (Hotel No. 9) was booked,so our agent found this. We loved the antiques, the charm, etc. We had a large room on the second floor with a King size bed - and yes, the traditional cement mattress. I guess you'd have to stay at the Sheraton for a softer one....We had adequate air conditioning, the bathroom was big and clean, and we liked the breakfasts, tho we also sometimes ordered a ala carte for something heartier. Didn't eat at the restaurant since there's so much available in Shanghai, but it was pleasant.The staff were very friendly, there's a computer near the front desk for free internet, and we could walk to the french quarter. All in all,a good alternative to staying at a hotel where you could be in any city in the world.....this is definitely a Shanghai experience. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Hip in old-skool style Had a great stay at this hotel. The rooms were big and had great interior design. The service was also excellent and the staff was very friendly and accomodating.The hotel restaurant was also very interesting. It was very modern and hip, a stark contrast from the supposed-Chinese-inn atmosphere of the hotel. Food was delicious, although the free breakfast got boring on the 3rd day. Same menu every day. Location was great too. It is right by many little shops, bakeries, and the train station. Taxis are easily accessible too. One thing to note. If you are expecting a totally Chinese traditional inn experience, you might be a little disappointed. Don't expect too much. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Great Boutique Hotel Quickly:- Boutique hotel- GREAT restaurant attached- Spotless very sparely, but chic-ly decorated rooms- 12 minute taxi ride to The Bund- Staff driver who will pick you up and organize day tripsIt's called the Old House Inn because it's in a very cool OLD HOUSE. If you're looking for a non-corporate and more charming place to stay in Shanghai, stay here. I think they have about 20ish rooms all of which are spotless with chocolate wooden floors, antique furniture and good [firm] beds. Over the course of ten days, I stayed in two different rooms. Room 201 is large, has a very comfortable queen bed and a few tables. It also has two french door windows that open to a balcony that overlooks the [very tasty] restaurant attached to the property - A Future Perfect [where you eat your basic breakfast]. This restaurant has a great covered patio and serves excellent martinis. I eventually moved to the 3rd floor to a very cozy room with a slanted ceiling which I nicknamed the Anne Frank room. I was alone and so it seriously didn't matter. I loved this place. It was very easy to stay in and the staff wrote all my destinations down before hopping into a taxi. There is no common room or computer for guests [although I believe the rooms have wireless access]. You can hang in the restaurant/bar if you need some social interaction. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Great location shame about the breakfast This hotel was highly recommended as a gem in Shanghai, and while I can't quite agree that it's what Shanghai needs more of, it is a unique experience. I was travelling on business and stayed for 5 nights.I arranged a pick-up service from Pudong airport, but they weren't waiting for me when I arrived. I phoned the hotel to tell them, but their English isn't great, so I wasn't entirely convinced they would sort it. The driver arrived about 15 minutes later.The hotel is located just down off the main road, and initially I was put off by the location as it looks a bit dirty, but that's nothing to worry about. Reception could do with sprucing up, but otherwise is fine. I was initially in room 303 on the top floor, which has a sloping ceiling, so I didn't get a full four-poster bed as seen on their website. It had a nice bath-tub, but with the sloping ceiling, it wasn't the best shower in the world. I changed rooms to the one next door no problem and had the nice four-poster and a shower cubicle I could stand up in! There is a really fast and FREE internet connection in the rooms - just don't forget your laptop. Beds are surprisingly comfortable despite being very firm by British standards.The restaurant is where you have breakfast, and they have a bizarre system where you have to get a card from reception to give to the waiting staff. Breakfast consists of four thick slices of white toast, boiled egg, coffee or tea and orange juice. It's a O way to start the day, but not very traditional. You can buy other options, and I thoroughly recommend their museli - it comes with lashings of fesh fruit and yoghurt and costs a reasonable price.The staff at the reception desk are extremely helpful and very personable. They understand more than they speak, and will write down addresses in Chinese characters for you.Overall, it is a good stay in this hotel if you're looking for something other than the usual corporate hotel experience. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Good location - so-so accomodation Located in the middle of the French Concession, the Old House is in a good location that ins't in the center of the city hustle and bustle. The rooms were nice and clean, but small, with typical Chinese mattresses (i.e. extremely firm). The hotel, unfortunately, is adjacent to a restaraunt, which can be quite loud. It seems like our room was immediately over the kitchen, which was noisy - especially as it started up early in the morning to serve breakfast. We also conjectured that the kitchen used all of the hot water, as we were only able to achieve one semi-warm shower per day. The rest were cold showers. It was a shame that the noise and water were such detractors, because otherwise I would have enjoyed the stay. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Fashionable My young cousin who lives in Shanghai booked this for my son and me, so it was certain to be trendy. The room was a little small, and we had to share the bed. But it was clean and the bathroom was reasonable, and the water hot but of variable pressure. I did use the heater a little even in April. The staff were friendly if imperfectly anglophonic, and they dealt well with a laundry emergency. The included breakfast is western, which is a shame really, but my son liked it. There is nothing of great interest right nearby, but JingAn station is not a far walk. The map on their businesscard is so stylised that some taxi drivers have trouble finding the place. It was pricier than places we stayed in other cities, but this could be a Shanghai phenomenon. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Shanghai Surprise! My boyfriend and I stayed at the OHI for 4 nights and it was a true gem of a hotel. We booked a standard double, but had to stay in one of the larger &quot;suites&quot; on the top floor for the first night b/c they were booked. While the room was larger (king bed and tub v. double and shower stall), it wasn't worth the extra $$. The room we were transferred to was not only much more intimate and smaller, the bathroom was just as nice and we LOVED it. We actually preferred the smaller room as it was cozier and we had none of the noise/ventilation issues that former reviewers had.There was an issue w/ the heating/AC unit b/c the remote was in Chinese, but the front desk was VERY helpful during our entire stay. It is true: be prepared for very limited English-speaking staff at night, but during the day, the staff was super friendly. While we never made it to the breakfast, the restaurant staff was also helpful whenever we popped in to buy water, etc. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel as a preferred alternative to the Hyatts and other mainstream big hotels b/c it is a true gem! We would go back in a heartbeat! "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Old House Inn -- disagree with previous review Appreciate the comments of the previous reviewer, but my experience of the Old House is that it is a gem of a hotel. The rooms are minimally furnished but with four poster beds and traditional (or at least traditional style) furniture it makes for a unique experience away from some of the bland chain hotels. The staff are friendly and helpful and it is well located in the French Concession.I wholeheartedly recommend a stay there. "
house inn shanghai caobao road ,"Clean but not for lone travellers Stayed twice on the 14th (Double room 680RMB)and 17th (Single room 490RMB)Both rooms clean and tidy but small compared to other hotels.

howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Very nice clean suite If it's not for the subpar location, this hotel would have been a great pick. Located at a quiet residential area of Shanghai, this hidden gem has one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever seen and I have been to quite a few places (see my profile) !As the hotel name has suggested, all hotel rooms are suites with really nice living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. I had the best sleep ever on my business trips here. The only knock was its location. Some of the local taxi drivers did not know this place at all so be sure to carry a local map or the hotel's business card with you just in case. There's no decent restaurant within walking distance other than a Shanghaiese restaurant to the left of the hotel next to a motel. No convenience store could be spotted nearby as well. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Excellent I was there for 3 weeks. This HOJO is nothing like the North American HOJO, this one is so so much better! I've travelled quite a bit and I can tell you that the rooms are as good as it shows on their website. There are lots of hotels which tries to show how pretty the room is but when you're actually there, the quality of the room is nothing as it looked on their website, but for HOJO, you won't believe it but its better than what it shows on their site. Believe it! Beautiful suite with a nice kitchen &amp; sink but you'll have to buy your own pots &amp; pans :) which is no biggie..The bed is king size...good mattress, pillows...everything was excellent..there is nothing I would complain about this place and trust me, I am very picky person, so if I say its good...its REALLY GOOD!! You'll thank me for this recommendation. Another good thing about this place is because I stayed from 3 weeks, the sales person, his name is Frank and he offered me a washing machine in my room. The moment I checked in, they brought the washing machine in and set it up in the balcony. This was very convenient for me because as I said, I'm picky person and I would prefer to do my own laundry. He also gave me free access to internet. The staff are extrememly friendly and the cleaner cleans the room every single day and by the time I'm off work, the room is nice and fresh! The bathroom is equiped with almost any need..and they replace every single day! The only only thing that I should say is missing is a swimming pool, that would have been great had there been one..but its no biggie for me because Shanghai is such a beautiful city and I'd rather go out and visit places. Convenience wise, its ok...doable...I should say...taxi is available anytime ...of course...anywhere else...during rush hours its always longer...but otherwise its great! Staff downstairs are very friendly and helpful. There is a travel agency downstair and the guy working there is also Frank. Very helpful at all times and took real good care of me and help me organise my weekend trips to Hangzou etc. Finally...its a really nice hotel ...and worth the money...and honestly...it made my stay very more comfortable! Would definitely stay again if I'm back in Shanghai! "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Great rooms with friendly staff For approx A$120 per night we had a magnificent apartment with King size bed. The quality of the fixtures and fittings were top class. The facilities were excellent with separate TV's in lounge and bedroom, and fully equipped kitchen.Prices and food quality were also very good in the Monet Restaurant - but, there were only a few tables occupied on the Saturday evening we were there.The staff were efficient and very friendly - broken English, but passable.Yes, there is a downside and that is distance from centre of town. However, a taxi to The Bund will only cost you A$4, so is that really an issue?We would stay there again, and thoroughly recommend it. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Like your own private apartment Was booked at this hotel by my local business contact. I have to admit I was not feeling good about being in a Howard Johnsons, but this hotel is a former luxury apartment building.

howard johnson all suites hotel ,"A recommended hotel The hotel has an excellent location. Just a few minutes walk from Nanjing Road and the subway stations. It does not take you long to walk to the Bund as well.( Last time I went to Shanghai i stayed at Westin. Of course the services provided by Westin provided was of higher quality, but the cost was much much higher too.)We had 2 rooms and both were clean and comfortable. The serivce was quite good as well. We booked the hotel through a travel agent. The price was reasonable compared to the services provided. I will recommend my friends to stay there if they go to Shanghai. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Best Hotel in Shanghai Howard Johnson All Suites Shanghai is the place to stay! I am a frequent traveller where I travel from Hong Kong to Shanghai every week, arrive on every Friday and depart on Sunday. Somtimes I stay for 3 nights depending on the situation. The hotel itself has a nice lobby, although the staff members sometimes are not too quite friendly but it is manageable. The room itself is very large and clean! No complains there. Comfy beds and for the price for around 500 - 600 rmb, you get a suite with the necessary amenities, coffee maker, mini bar, refrigerator, bottled water, washroom amenities. Transportation is very convienient versus the 5 stars hotel like the le meridien etc.. As the hotel is located in a more suburb area, taxi quantities seems to be more around that area! "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Good Hotel The Howard Johnson offers you more than only a hotelroom; large suites with own kitchen and seperate living and bedroom.The Howard is small compared to other big Shanghai Hotels.

The rooms is decorated very nice with good paintings and colours on the walls.The bathroom is ok, large but simple equipt.The staff is friendly but thats all, roomservice menu is small but quality and pricing are ok.So far everything is ok, altough I personally got one negative point.Because the rooms are large and equipt as a appartment and because all the rooms are located very private you can feel lonely. Maybe a litlle bit strange to post in a review but i really felt it this way, the rooms remind me at home, and you dont see lots of guests. Overall; good place to stay, reasonable pricing, small. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Good Value for Money But do not expect a good service I stayed in the HJ All Suites Hotel last year for the whole December before I found a nice Apartment. The Suites are about 50 sqm. You can choose between 1 or 2 bedroom suites with spacious living area, small kitchen but no kitchen supplies and a more or less big bathroom. The shower was ok and the heating bulbs were working. The Air condition, which is at the same time the heater was not really working in the bedroom. Therefore I had to leave my curtains closed for almost the whole 4 weeks. The staff is firendly but of actual no help. At the check in they could not find the reservation made by my company. It took me about 1 hour to check in. I ate only one time in the restaurant and had twice room service. It was ok but I thought a little bit too expensive. The location is only reachable by Taxi or you walk about 15 minutes to the next Subway station. The door man were friendly but did only know the famous places in Town. Otherwise you are better off without them. I would recommend the place again because of the spacious rooms but not because of the service. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Small but good rooms Neat and clean rooms.Good value for money. Some of the rooms are small and can do better.

howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Good for Business not for Pleasure I was recently in China on business and had the chance to stay in some pretty nice hotels. I ended my trip with a few days in Shanghai for some relaxation and stay at the Howard Johnson All Suites Hotel ( not to be confused with the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel). If you are staying at this hotel, make sure the taxi driver knows which one it is because mine didn't. I ended up at the Howard Johnson Plaza which is quite a ways away and actually in a better location. Who would have thought there would be two Howard Johnsons in Shanghai?Getting back to the hotel experience. Everyone was very nice and helpful, for the most part, when I arrived and checked-in. The only problem I had was the bell hop never brought my bag to my room. I ended up having to go back down to the lobby and get my bag and bring it up myself. No big deal. The food at the hotel was average but they did have a good breakfast in the morning. The room was very big with a seperate sleeping area, kitchen, large bathroom and living area. My only complaint about the room is the bed. The bed was hard as a rock. As this was true, it isn't necessarily a bad thing in China. Every hotel I stayed in had rock hard beds and they were all &quot;5 star&quot; hotels. One of the other American hotels in Shanghai may have softer beds.As for the location of the hotel, it isn't very good if you are there for vacation or leisure. There is really nothing within a short walking distance. I went out for a walk on a Saturday night and found no nightlife or shopping in the area. I did happen to find a cool hole-in-the-wall bar called Charlie's Coffee Bar on Nanjing W Rd. It had a nice atmosphere and the drinks were expensive.Next time I will stay closer to the shopping areas when I am in Shanghai but if you are there on business, this is a great place to stay. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"tasteful The business suite was huge and you could really make it your home away from home there was even a kitchenette which I did not use but was a nice touch, the serivce was excellent, and the rooms very clean. The location was a bit far from everything and there were no special restaurants or attractions nearby but then you can't have everything, as the price was good. I would stay there again, it's close the hongqiao airport as well, and the hotel is well managed! "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Suites a good choice accommodation I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (2 couples) and we all enjoyed the stay. The rooms are large and each bedroom has a very comfortable Kingsize bed. Only one toilet/ bathroom. But has a kitchen, small office area and large lounge area. Also stayed for 2 nights in a one bedroom suite. This also had a good kingsize bed and small kitchenette. and shower (in both suites - no bath).Good small gym and business centre (open 8am to 10) Internent 10y for 10 mins then 1 y for each other minute, not fast, unfortunately.Service by the bellboys/conceirge was very good. Free China Daily and USA today available if you are fast.Check out service could do with some modernisation.I booked thru an internet site wotif and got excellent rates for the first 2 nights and when I wanted to extend my stay in the one br suite they sent me back to the website because they could not match the price.I would definitely opt for this choice if back in Shanghai. Caution There is a HJ hotel and a HJ All suites Hotel in Shanghai. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"A ship is only as good as its crew A ship is only as good as its crew. The Howard Johnson as a hotel appears magnificent and there is no reason why it should not be. However;1 Arrived at the hotel to have room number scribbled down wrong.2 Showed up for breakfast and did not find bacon, sausages, hash browns etc in their places and had to chase up staff to get on top of the situation on 3 separate occasions (we stayed 5 nights).3 Used the shower after use of the pool and stood on a cigarette end in there.4 Had no faith in the door staff putting you in a taxi and sending you in the right direction, on our leaving we did use them one more time to ask taxi driver to take us to maglev train, to take us to airport, he took us straight to airport!!5 Hotel concierge by name only, great if you don’t ask any questions.Chose this hotel on recommendations from web, I suspect a managerial shake up would improve things here, as its stands I wouldn’t go back. Great hotel, motley crew! "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"On your own! I hate to have to write this review, but after nearly missing my flight due to the negligence of the staff, I feel like I need to warn others. The Howard Johnson is indeed a luxury hotel in terms of appearance - a beautiful lobby, rooms, and spa. But it is not a luxury hotel in terms of service. I had booked transportation to the airport through the hotel and was told to wait in the lobby and they would inform me when the shuttle had arrived. 10 minutes after the scheduled departure I became worried so went to ask at the desk. As it turns out the shuttle had come and gone with no notice from the staff. To make matters worse they offered no alternate method of transportation, or even an apology. Thank God my partner spoke Mandarin and we were able to get a taxi (at 3X the price) to take us there. It was such a terrible way to have to end my vacation in Shanghai, I just don't want anyone else to have the same experience. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"Fab suite! We were upgraded by reception to a deluxe suite - and it was lovely! Very clean, recently refurbished, and it even had a small balcony. It was fairly modest, but you had more space than a hotel room.The hotel staff were very friendly, with a handful of them speaking fluent english.The only disadvantage was the taxi drivers seemed unsure of where the hotel was - even though it was on a main road. But the key card reception gives you has a map on it, so this helps. Would definately stay here again. "
howard johnson all suites hotel ,"2 weeks at the Howard Johnson My first trip to China and the company put me into the HJ for the 2 weeks. This is a brand new hotel and the numerous staff do fall over themselves to help. The suite I was in cost around 1200rmb per day and was really impressive with bedroom c/w king size and TV; kitchen; bathroom with shower and living room with seating for four or five, big TV, and desk with high speed access. The suite has more lights and light switches than an average house with as many as 8 light switches just to operate all the lights in just the bedroom alone!The good bits were1. A dining room that catered to western tastes including on-demand eggs the way you like them in the morning.2. An incredibly swift and efficient valet service that didn't keep my clothes for more than about 8 hours no matter what speed of service I requested.3. Good in-room internet access 4. Excellent coverage of European soccer on the cable feed!The drawbacks were 1. An air conditioner that just couldn't handle the Shanghai humidity even in November or keep the suite cool enough for a Canadian's taste2. An on-demand hot water system that had a mind of it's own and gave wildly fluctuating shower temperatures for about 45 seconds at a time.3. It's location out on the Yanan Road W. is not the greatest for reaching anything interesting on footAs a rookie to China, my feeling was that this was decent value for what I got compared with more central, downtown hotels.

howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,Best Service ever!!! Incredible Staff Very helpful staff!! made our stay unforegettable experience.... Well Done! 
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,"Nice and enjoyable business hotel This hotel is a bargin! Its quite new. Wonderful bed. Nicely decorated room, decent shower. "
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,Best thing - Location. Worst thing - Location I stayed in this hotel on the business trip. Rooms are comfortable and modern with a nice LCD TV and free wired Internet. Like the bathtub and all the amenities. The hotel is new after all. The only complaint about the room is the air conditioning blows right into your face so I ended up switching off the air conditioning in these hot summer nights. The best part of the hotel as many reviewers mentioned is the convenient location in downtown and near shopping and restaurants and subway. The worst part is also the location. It is at a busy intersection and shanghai drivers lover their horns. So you will be woken up at 6AM whether you like it or not. Also there is a huge construction site across the street so if the traffic does not wake you up the bulldozers and cranes will. Another down side is the elevators on the south end of the hotel is frequently used by staff and housekeeping so expect a long wait. North end elevators are fine. 
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,"Exceeded expectations The hotel is across the street from Four Seasons and two blocks away from Nanjing Lu. Starbucks is just downstairs and there are 24/h convenient stores, ATM and bakery just a block away. Walking distant to restaurants, DVD stores on Dagu Road and the club, SIN, is across the street. The hotel lobby is new and modern, but hotel staff are slightly weird (one of them couldn't stop staring at me). The room has a comtemporary feel to it and is nice and clean. internet is free, but wired. The room service menu after 11:30pm is sad with just 7 choices. But for RMB 630 nett/night on the weekends, it's a real bargin (Four seasons across the street charge RMB 1700/night +taxes). If you crave a cheaper option stil, check out Hanting Express down Shimen Road for around RMB300/night) "
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,"A new concept of suites in the heart of Shanghai... So many hotels in Shanghai and so many competitors too...Shanghai has everything to propose for spoiled travellers as me...Was very impressed by this hotel especially about the location, cannot find better... located at the opposite of Four Seasons Hotel and at few steps from the famous People Square.Rooms, well we need to say more suites are impeccable, well designed with nice furniture, color shades and excellent amenities, really appreciated the bedding, lighting and the large list of TV channels. The complimentary internet access and Wi Fi thru the hotel is a plus.Staff and services are fine especially security and doormen who will assist you at anytime for a taxi and many things we need when we are in a hotel.Good job and not easy to be different in Shanghai... "
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,"Not bad for the price and location I stayed for eight days to visit friends and meet business contacts. I set my expectations low based on limited reviews online. The room rates were reasonable at the time and internet connection was included (wired. no wifi in rooms). The location is across the street from Four Seasons. It's 5 minutes walk to Nanjing Lu subway station. Central enough to walk to most attractions around Shanghai. It’s one of the main reasons I selected this hotel versus others of similar quality.Overall, the lobby and facilities are just 'ok'. Nothing grand. The details and the layout seemed a bit off. Once I got into the room however, I was impressed. The room I received looks to be 1 of 2 unique room layouts (see photos). The windows span the length of the room which is very nice. Bathroom details were modern, very nice and clean. Towels were big, soft and comfortable. The bed was great. Sheets and pillows very comfortable. Lounge chair and work desk were well placed, modern and convenient. The windows were operable in the bedroom and bath which allows fresh air (Shanghai Fresh) to circulate. Since I previously lived in Shanghai, I never requested room service or required much assistance. Overall, service was good. I could tell that the people were still being trained and they are trying to maintain high standards. It wasn't perfect (staff at the door were not always personable or outwardly friendly) but the front desk and individual encounters with staff were good. Even the cleaning lady by the elevator greeted us (ni hao) unexpectedly and reveals some training to welcome and greet guests. I'd give special credit to the bell boy (Mr. Smith) for getting the room in order and finding umbrellas during a downpour. The room was well cleaned daily. They never knocked when the ‘do not disturb’ light was on. The gym is adequate. I used is one of the three treadmills during my stay. The outdoor tennis court was nice. I looked for the basement pool but got lost trying to locate it. Based on the quality of the room, I'd recommend this hotel to friends who were looking for a decent hotel though I caution about the construction across the street.Notes of Caution: (1)There is construction currently in progress in front of the hotel. It looks like its just getting started. Expect some noise. It was tolerable while I was there though it did continue past 10pm. The Four Seasons guest also have to put up with the same thing but they're probably paying at least 2x more. (2) There is a whiskey lounge bar next door (same building but separate entrance). Although it’s on the ground floor, you can hear singing and music up to the 20th floor. (3) all rooms seem to allow smoking. There was no odor in my room though this may change as it seeps into the carpet and curtains. (4) The signage &quot;Howard Johnsons&quot; is tiny. Coming from the airport, you might not know you have arrived at the right location since even taxi drivers are just getting familiar with the hotel name. "
howard johnson business club hotel shanghai ,"Practical business hotel reasonably convenient with limited amenities Convenience - doesn't even offer the most basic service of currency exchange, staff said the hotel has `just opened' in December so service wasn't ready yet, though it's already been three months. Location - none of the cab drivers recognized the name of the hotel. Better tell them it's opposite Four Seasons Hotel. Don't expect much to see around the area for shopping/sightseeing. Restaurant - getting lunch/dinner is a problem. only one restaurant (cafe) in the entire hotel, which serves buffet breakfast. Dinner is not impressive at all - below average Western and Asian dishes with a three-page menu. Disappointing for the price charged at a four-to-five-star hotel. Starbucks right next door.Hotel staff said there are cheap food stalls selling local snacks within 5-10 mins walk. Haven't seen for myself though.Service - Marco at the concierge was exceptionally helpful. Offered to help my family to buy a meal from local restaurants nearby. Brought back scrumptious food within 10 mins. On another instance, I was trying to check a boutique that I saw in Beijing but a staff only asked me to look around local department stores without offering more help. Deluxe rooms aren't spacious at all, looking over new residential building. But a clean, nice bathroom compensated part of that.Huge plus is all guests are required to insert room key in the elevator to access to all floors to ensure security. If you are just looking for a safe, comfortable place to stay and dont require much amenities, go for this one.Taxi to hotel from airport costs about RMB 150. "

Why would you want to stay there?* Value-conscious shopper* Be in the heart of the French Concession* Stay in a newish (though not brand new) establishment* Be able to get to the metro in under 5 minutes on foot. * Be close to bars and restaurants* Spotlessly clean, flat screen TV, comfy bed with good quality linen.Why wouldn't you want to stay there?* If you prefer generously proportioned roomsHow much?* expect to pay just under US$100 a night.This hotel is now my default choice when travelling for leisure.

howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Fantastic hotel Stayed there for a couple of nights,could have done with more. The room is fabulous,bathroom is superb. Bell hops and concierges were all extremely helpful. Location is faultless. Lots of eating places around the area and also small boutiques for shopping. "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Great hotel great location My parents go to Shanghai nearly every year and normally stay at the Donghu Hotel which is right up the street from the new HoJo HuaiHai. However we decided to give HoJo a chance this time as the hotel was recently completed and was advertising a very good promotional rate. The rooms were excellent - very comfortable, not as big as the Donghu but still a comfortable size. The showers were high pressure and felt great. Location is great - on a major commercial artery in Puxi, walking distance to a number of shops and restaurants, short cab ride (or long walk) to a number of bar areas, near 2 subway stations if you want to take public transport. We didn't try the restaurant at the hotel -- it appeared to serve mostly Western food so we were not interested. "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Great staff great location a very nice hotel to call home for a week My wife and I started our Honeymoon around the world at this hotel and we are very pleased with our choice of this fabulous hotel. We were greeted nicely everytime we came or went from the hotel. The staff we always very nice and helpful and did their best to answer our questions. Not everyone's english was perfect but it was more than adequate for anyone with a modicum of patience. The location is a long city block away from a grocery and a shopping mall. In the same place as the grocery and the shopping is the train station which is your portal to the rest of shanghai. There are some very good restaurants a stones throw away as well. The hotel was clean and quiet. The amenities were good as well. Being able to watch the NBA playoffs in the morning was different but enjoyable. For those travelers who don't speak the local language(s) be sure to grab a map and a &quot;take me home&quot; card from the concierge. It will make getting home so much easier. Also don't be afraid to ask your concierge for anything that you are looking for. They will either go and find it for you or send you in the right direction (marked on your map).We look foward to staying here again, "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Exploring the French Concession - Start here! A good place to stay if you wish to explore the French Concession, which is one of the very few spots that offer something close to a pleasant walk in Shanghai. The hotel is 10min from the Line 1 Shaanxi Nanlu (Shaanxi Road South) Station, 15min in the rain. No easy access to 24-hr stores, but you can stock up on water and snacks at the basement of Parksons (mall above metro) on your way back to the hotel. Touts at traffic junctions.Huaihai Zhonglu (the former Avenue Joffre), on which the metro sits, offers loads of dining and shopping choices. It leads out to quieter streets where you get spots of culture and history (eg. Donghu hotel, Ruijin hotel, Fuxing Park, former residence of Sun Yat Sen, former residence of Soong Ching-ling, or even Xintiandi - all walkable from this hotel). A quieter, almost pretty spot away from the rest of Shanghai under construction.Stay at this hotel if you don't want to have to put up with the remotest possibility of encountering mold, rust, dirt or aging furniture, and yet don't want to pay 5-star rates. Was upgraded to a deluxe room after 1 night in a superior room due to a faulty lock, but could not really tell the difference, except the complimentry plate of fruits and maybe a &quot;better&quot; view on a higher floor? Nothing to shout about, the sky's all grey and polluted everywhere.You get HBO and the usual fare on cable in all rooms. Buffet breakfast has a decent variety: Chinese porridge and the usual eggs, ham and cereal. They will ask for a 600-yuan deposit at check-in, no matter what your online agent says. "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,A good place for shopper and nightlife... Certainly one of the best locations in Shanghai.Nice hotel with very comfortable and clear rooms including LCD TV with a good choice of international channels.Complimentary internet in the room.Interesting design for the bathroom (especially the wash bassin) and all white.Really like the duckies!!!! on the tub.Bedding and mattress was excellent for a good sleep after a good shopping and night life...Eco friendly hotel using only recycling paper or fabrics instead of plastic.Good job and congratualtions for that.Bell boy service was good at check in and check out.

howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Great Hotel great service good location It was my first visit to Shanghai, I spend 4 nights at this hotel and I can really say the rooms are excelent, the bathroom very nice and clean (as it should be), very modern and confortable bedroom, the restaurant of the hotel serves good food, the attention at the lobby and the concierge was extremely nice, cordial and impecable. I will definitely go back to this hotel in my next visit to Shanghai. "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,just perfect Really enjoyed my stay there.Rooms where clean.

howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Can't wait to come back! The building is magnificent, HIGH quality design and atmosphere. The service was friendly and very helpful. Most of the staff understands English. My room exceeds expectations, the exercise facility has treadmills, free weights, combo exercise machine, and other equipment...it also has 2 flat screen tv's, bottles of water and towels. The restaurant is great, the breakfast is AMAZING, they have traditional Chinese dishes along w/ traditional American breakfast foods like bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc. I highly recommend staying here, my stay has been comfortable, seemless and very ENJOYABLE! "
howard johnson huaihai hotel ,"Wow! After having stayed in Shanghai several times, I finally decided to give the Hojo Hua Hai Rd a try. It's location is just off the famous Hua Hai Rd, smack in the middle of the former French Concession. Upon walking into the small but adequate lobby you will be confronted with sit down check in, very friendly and helpful staff.The rooms are a greater surprise with new furnishings, all the mod cons, whopping big LCD TV on the wall, rubber duckie's in the bath tub and separate shower and bath. Views are straight across the French Concession.Not to mention that English wasn't a problem, even for the housekeeping staff, and the service from the bell boys is slick. Overall I cant possibly find fault with hotel, the best I have seen in it's 4 star class in Asia. "

howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Good location for a quick first visit. I decided to stay at the Howard Johnson as this was my first trip to Shanghai and I wanted to be in a fairly central location. Being a business trip of 3 days, time to see the city was also limited, so the central location worked well. Being right near Nanjing Rd, there are many shops - both individual and in shopping centres, and restaurants to choose from.The staff are pleasant and helpful, assisting me in trying to change a flight booking. Breakfast is the above average for the usual hotel buffet style however the price was a bit on the higher side. The hotel offers free internet in all rooms, which is very handy to have. I had a great view over the East Nanjing Rd pedestrian mall, the rooms were of good size, and the bathroom quite large. Complimentary bottled water is also provided each day, which is handy to have.I had one afternoon with 3-4 free hours, and decided to take a quick walk around the French Concession area. If I were to visit Shanghai again, I would most likely look for something in this area seeing as I have experienced 'central' Shanghai now. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,Great location Great location near Nanjing Road (though not as good as Sofitel). Great breakfasts choices and tastes. Nice clean rooms. Had a good view of Nanjing Road. Overall great stay. 
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Very Near shoppings park and museum. Decided to try 1 night with this hotel after few nights stays with Westin. Location wise is great, right next to Nanjing road, nearby People's park where you wil find Tai Chi excercises in the morning. Also the Shanghai museum which is within the park.Staff extremely helpful and also encourage me to join their membership ( free) in order to get room disc and free upgrades. Everything you expect from a 4 star ( i would rate it) and value for money. Henan metro station is closeby. Alot of attractions are within taxi rides of RMB 11 ( The taxi fares in shanghai starts at RMB11) "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Great location nice hotel I read some reviews on here and got a bit worried, but this hotel was fine. Found the staff helpful and the location is excellent. Very reasonable price too. I would certainly recommend it. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Avoid this Hotel There is no customer service at this hotel. I had a medical problem and required a doctor; the response was ‘go find one’ from the assistant manager supposedly “there to help you!”. I checked out and went over to the Westin Hotel…a world of difference, better rooms, much better service, and a doctor arrived within half an hour. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Ordinary with minimal customer service The location is great, but nothing else stands out. The rooms are very average (we stayed in a much nicer Ho Jo in Ningbo) and breakfast is not included. This was the only hotel of four during our trip where it was not part of the package. We had some confusion on our reservation, even though it had been made from the concierge counter of the Ningo HoJo, and there was little attempt on the part of the staff the help clarify. We had a fluent Mandarin speaker with us, so language was not the issue. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Amazing location in Shanghai Welcoming lilies in the lobby, free upgrade to the business floor, two steps to Nanjing road, good feng shui in the rooms… We could not ask for more. There is plenty to do around the hotel to blend in Shanghai’s local’s lifestyle. We went to People’s park in the early morning to watch people practice Tai Chi, walked around Nanjing road in the morning where you will find people dancing. There are good and very inexpensive massage places all around the hotel area (I highly recommend Xuanni for US$8 one hour foot massage with Ahen na(#8) and Lej yuanjiu (#9) they are doing some construction on the first floor there, but don’t be scared, the place is on the second floor is quite nice.) "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"excellent hotel with great service posh hotel, great service, however the adjacent open market as people chase you for marketing, try for high floor for an excellent view "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Good stay The hotel is in a superb location - it could hardly be better. Near the Bund, Nanjing Shopping Street etc,. The hotel is very good - impressive lobby, good modern rooms - many with great views. I got a good deal on the room by booking online. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel - I thought that it was too expensive - but there are more than enough nearby places to eat breakfast in. I would certainly recommend it if you want to stay in the centre of Shanghai. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Great Experience HoJo was fine. A little pricey but all hotels in Shanghai are a little pricey. HotelService was great. English was spoken by all staff and they were very attentive and helpfulBreakfast was excellent, a very international mix of dishes and a relaxing atmosphere.Check-in and Check-out were fast, efficient, and with no incidentRoomLarge and clean. I found the room a little warm, but I found all the rooms I stayed in on this visit a little warm. I think it had to do with the time of year (April), and a transition from Furnace to AirCon.Television had a mix of international channels. Clean bath with all necessary amenities.Noise was not an issue, very quiet room.LocationVery close to Nanjing Road, lots of shops and restaurants nearby.Walking distance to the Bund and many sites.I will definately consider this hotel again next time I am in Shanghai. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"HoJo to the Rescue Wow--was a Howard Johnson Hotel or a Hilton--what a difference another continent makes!My wife and I stayed two nights at the Howard Johnson after ditching our previous hotel (the Bailemen) after one night. We read getting an affordable hotel room in Shanghai was tough and we spent a full morning running down the Nanjing Lu to find an affordable hotel.After trying the Marriott and Radisson hotels, we happened upon the Howard Johnson. At first the receptionist insisted on a price of $1600 RMB, but we negotiated the price down to $1000 RMB per night (it was more than we wanted to spend, but we didn't want to spend the night in another creepy hotel).The hotel was clean and the room was well appointed with marble tile bathrooms and counter tops. Prices for the mini-bar were par with luxury U.S. hotels, but the room was spacious, smoke-free, provided cable (including CNN and HBO), and a wonderful view of the neon nightlife along the Nanjing Lu.We also had the buffet dinner. It wasn't amazing, but is was quite good--with a range of western dishes, sushi, seafood, fresh fruit and dessert bar.We would definitely stay at the Howard Johnson again, it was a welcome refuge from our previous hotel! "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"One of the best hotels I visit in Asia I have been doing some business travel in 4 countries of Asia. And up to this time, I have to say that this is the best of all hotels I have visited. Very classy and clean room, sharp and funcional bathroom, lcd tv, great attention from all personnel (all of them talks english), the hotel is well located and near (couple of blocks) of Mc Donalds and Starbucks, for those who wants to remementer the taste of home. The only thing I guess they can improve is the menu on their cafeteria; they serve the same thing almost every day, even for breakfast. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel for the price This was my 4th time to Shanghai this year. Prior to this visit, I stayed on the Pudong side (work related reasons) of Shanghai at the Holiday Inn. If you're coming to Shanghai for sightseeing/vacation, stay on the Pushi side of Shanghai. The neighborhood:The hotel's in a very convenient located. It's right across from Nanjin Lu witch is a touristy area. I found 3 Starbucks and 1 Coffee Bean within a 4 block radius. Nanjin Lu and the surrounding area is great for shopping. There a subway station that you can get to within 5-10 minutes walking. The Hotel:This was my first time staying at Howard Johnson. I would recommend this hotel to friends if they came to Shanghai. The room that I got was clean, didn't smell like smoke, and the view from my room on the 10th floor was very nice. I believe most rooms have a window that faces north (like mine), and overlooks nanjin lu. i was happy with the number of TV channel that were aired in english (about 7).The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and their english was good for chinese standards.Room service is 24hours. Their menu was okay, but was a little shorter than other hotel room service menus.Asides from eating room service, I only tried the hotel buffet which was similar to the other hotels I've stayed in China. It was about $20 US (depending on the exchange rate). The quality and selection of the food was okay. Asides from being convenient, I wouldn't recommend it for the price.I didn't have time to try out the amenities and other services that the hotel offered during my 3 night stay.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to almost anyone who was visiting Shanghai. The only group that I wouldn't recommend this hotel would be Honeymooners. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Not bad nor great I went to shanghai for business/pleasure. Intel arranged for me to stay here for 1 week. My room a a great view and nice/clean bathrooms. Excellent location!!! The restaurant was crap, I rather eat out. Not really a 5 star hotel, more like a 3-4 star..... "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Wonderful position This hotel is perfectly located in the centre of Shanghai.10minutes walking distance from the Bound.It's perfect if you are there for 1-2 night. a perfect place where to stay.Rooms are big, clean, with many amenities.Restaurants are good only if you take the buffet....otherwise definetly better all the resturants out in area. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Confusing.... The location of the hotel is excellent. However, plenty of little issues that need to be addressed. Our booking was, very straightforward, booked through a travel agent, for 2 connecting rooms (2 adults, 2 kids) and airport transfers. I was told before that there were no connecting room in this hotel, which is amazing considering the size/ number of rooms. We settled for adjoining rooms. As I only received one key, I assumed that the room perhaps was connecting after all. Upon arriving at the room, we discovered that it was just ONE room, with a king-sized bed... Back down to the reception counter to ask for our second room. Ah yes... No adjoining room was available. Not good. Upon departure I noticed they posted the airport transfer charges to my bill, which I settled in advance with the travel agent already. This took 25 minutes to clarify with their reservations department and the travel agent's office. Despite that I provided them with a voucher etc. They really ought to look at their Front Office operation.On a positive note; the breakfast was good, and so was housekeeping. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,Fantastic We booked a deluxe room and were given a small suite on the 17th floor overlooking Nanjing pedetrianised shopping street. Absolutely fabulous. Room large and beautifuully equipped with wonderful service. Fantastic location - could not be bettered. Restaurant excellent and the buffets were terrific and incredible value (different theme every night). Marvellous lobby and bar with first rate service. Not cheap but very real value for money. Highly recommended. Din't miss the skyline on the Hangpu River about 10 minutes walk. Fantastic by day and wonderful at night. 
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Outstanding Attending a wedding held in one of the restaurants, our large family group spent 4 nights at the Ho-Jo and we could not have been more pleased. From the reception staff to the doorman to the wait staff, everyone was friendly and professional. The rooms were large and modern. Most importantly, they were immaculate, something not always seen in China's hotels. The bathrooms were large and rather elegant. Some of us had views of Nanjing Road and its brilliant lights. One highlight was the buffet breakfast. There were literally dozens of breakfast choices including both Western and Asian dishes, with a chef to whip up the omelet of your choice. The coffee and tea were fresh brewed and delicious. The location was perfect. Just a block from Nanjing Road, there were unlimited shopping possibilities. A walk to the river took less than 15 minutes. Also, it was a short walk to the subway, giving us access to the entire city. Overall, this was our best experience in China and we would not hesitate to recommend this fine hotel to anyone visiting Shanghai. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Good place Rooms comfortable and well equipped. Great buffet, western style breakfast. Good location for shopping.no free internet though. Comparable to a 3-star US hotel. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"The 'HoJo' - a pretty good choice! Having read some of the previous reviews we were a bit worried about the 5 star self rating, and the fact that a number of people complained that despite booking a non smoking room ended up in a smoking room. On the basis of these reviews I rang two nights before our arrival and confirmed our booking for twin beds/non smoking. On arrival we were advised that the hotel was full and that there were no twin/non smoking rooms available. The hotel proposed that we take a king bed room (not suitable for mother and teenage son) or smoking room twin. I was thankful that I had rung to confirm the booking and so could reiterate this in our negotiations. In the end, and without too much difficulty, we were placed in a suite with a roll-out bed for the first night and then re-located to our twin/non smoking room the next day. Throughout our 7 nights staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were great and equipped/re-stocked with all 4-5 star ammenities, inlcuding robes and slippers (noted by a previous guest as absent). The hotel is well located in the city - particulary in relation to the metro, and cabs (very cheap) were always available outside the hotel. The only downside to the hotel was the very overpriced and poor standard buffet breakfast ($30AU per person). Other options in the local neighbourhhood were not that great either - though we did find a 'french baguette' bakery just a two blocks away. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Very nIce hotel 4-1/2 stars Stayed here 5 nights for business/pleasure. Rooms were very nice. Marble bathrooms (though the toilet sometimes ran if not flushed just so). Bottled water was replenished two times a day in the room. Great location, close to most tourist spots. Fitness center was decently equipped (free weights, treadmills, bikes, rowing machines) and a nice sized indoor pool. Multiple saunas and hot tubs (not quite hot enough). Never saw anyone using it. Breakfast buffet was fine. Nothing gourmet but nice all the same. Staff was friendly and helpful, made great recommendations and would write directions in Chinese for taxis. The staff demeanor seemed to reflect the attitude of whoever they were speaking to. If someone was being overly rude and angry, the hotel person became very stone-faced. However, I found a friendly tone was met with a very friendly response.My only disappointment was how expensive laundry was (US$2 for underwear, $US5 for a t-shirt) though it was quick. I'm sure that there are nicer hotels with better amenities, but this one was very good. Between 4 and 5 stars. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Mediocre I recently stayed at the Howard Johnson in the Huangpu District of Shanghai. I found it mediocre despite being rated as a 5 star hotel. While checking in, we found the staff unfriendly. They put us on the smoking floor. We requested for transfer to a non-smoking floor as I am asthmatic and the man behind the desk acted like it was an imposition. He checked his computer and told us curtly that it was impossible as the hotel was fully booked. We were scheduled to stay in the hotel for 5 nights, so I requested we be informed of any vacancies on the non-smoking floors during our stay. While the man (his name was Michael) replied in the affirmative, he wore a heavily burdened expression as if our request was totally unreasonable. We never heard from him again. The breakfast buffet was unsatifactory. I fould the choices wanting and the food was on the bland and oily side. I would think twice about staying at the Howard Johnson again. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Excellent hotel fantasitc staff good breakfast great location This hotel exceeded our expectations from the start, however in order to remain objective I will put forward the areas that need some improvement. The check-in was efficient and the rooms were grand, commanding and spacious. The hotel has all the facilities of a 5 stat hotel - restaurants, gym, concierge, pool and more. The hotel decor is very grand and quite Chinese in style which very much suits the city.The breakfasts were good, the fruit selection however was not as good as it could be. The selection were the &quot;basic&quot; fruits, once on the road we found more local fruits and more exotic fruits I would have liked to seen on the buffet. The concierge were so so helpful and were very efficient and went above and beyond their duties. The club floor needs some improvement as the nightly cocktail selection is not quite as good as other hotels. The location of the hotel is very good - 5 minute taxi to The Bund, French Concession, Nanjing Pedestrian Mall, Old City and all within walking distance.Would stay again very happy. No problems. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Surely not a 5 Star Hotel the room is good but the toilet inside the room got flooded easily.unlike some 5 star international hotels which we have visited in other parts of the worldi, this hotel does not provide bath robe or sleepers made for kids.. the spa facility on the 6th floor is very poor especially the decor and the facilities. For example, i had to wait for over 10 minutes before there was hot water in the shower areas. There was only one bottle of what appears to be shower gel in each shower room. The bottle was not labelled and one had to guess what it was. If that was indeed shower gel, then something else which one could invariably find in 5 stars hotels are obviously missing. It seemed that the the entire spa facility was inherited from the previous hotel without any substantial improvement works as the decor and the shower facility look old.Aapart from some cotton tips and a tissue box, there wasn't any other toiletries such as face cream, lotion, in the women's changing room. I understood from my husband that there was also no razor or shaving cream provided in the male changing room. the choice of food in room service is limited and some of the food is very expensive. for example, a bowl of corn soup costs RMB95 whereas the best Chinese restaurant voted by Talter Shanghai only sells it at RMB38. generally, the staff speak fairly good English but when my 8 years old daughter called up the service centre (they do not call it housekeeping) and asked for a tooth brush, the staff tried to correct her English by saying &quot;you mean a teeth brush?&quot; and when I said &quot;three people&quot; in reply to the receptionist's question at the coffee shop before she sat us down, she tried to correct my English by saying &quot;you mean three persons&quot;.there is no priority for taxi even if you are a hotel guest and you have to queue up for taxi behind non-hotel guests. we witnessed a fight between some local people and the hotel valet parking staff which became physical whilst queuing up for the taxi.there is a system in this hotel that they will lend only one brolly for each room whilst it is raining. So even if you stay with your spouse and each of you may be heading different directions, you have to work out with your spouse who is going to use that brolly and who is to be soaked in the rain.one thing worthy of mention about this hotel is the answer given by a lfit attendant when we asked her how many stars this hotel has. Her initial answer was this was a 5 star hotel and when being asked further why no sign was put up to tell its guests how many stars this hotel has, her answer was the hotel was built in accordance with 5 star standards and they are applying for it to be so branded "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Enjoyed the Howard Johnson This hotel exceeded our expectations. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The resaurants were very good; the morning breakfast was exceptional. The hotel staff are very accomodating and helpful with directions, etc. The hotel is conveniently located and is a very good location for walking around the city of Shangai. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"A Good Hotel Experience I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and was satisfied with the room and service. It's not the best hotel in Shanghai, but it's not bad.The lobby is very nice with seating areas for coffee or drinks. Food from the restaurants and the sandwich/chocolate shop was good and reasonably priced. The concierge is very helpful here - they happily accomodated all our requests and wrote our destination in Chinese on a card for us to give to the cabdrivers. Laundry service is a bit pricey but everything was returned promptly.The room is a decent size, as is the bathroom. Water is NOT filtered here. The closet is very small and you cannot close the doors with a suit jacket hanging, which is inconvenient as closing the doors extinguishes the light. There is an in-room safe.The beds are the hardest I have ever seen - like a cement pad! Linens are nice, towels are fine.Internet access in the business center is pricey, but local calls can be made for a reasonable charge in the business center. Be warned - just to pick up the phone in your room and dial an 800 number will cost you Y$35.Location is good for the Pu Xi side. Sometimes cabs are plentiful, sometimes not.My only complaint with this hotel - they told us we had a non-smoking room. As we went to our room, a hotel worker ran in in front of us, gathered up all the ashtrays, and said &quot;Now non-smoking!&quot;. You have to bully your way into a non-smoking room - only the pregnant people in our group got an actual non-smoking room. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel excellent service I stayed at this beautiful property for 6 nights and really enjoyed it. The rooms were modern and nicely decorated with dark woods. The service was overall outstanding. The employees welcome you, open doors for you, and even call the lifts for you. Also the gym was spotless and well equipped.The Bund is walking distance from the hotel and numerous shops are right outside. The only negative is the insanely inflated prices for the bar, so you should walk outside to a minimart and buy beer for almost nothing. "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Better than the JW Marriott Half of our tour group of 50 people were dropped off to stay at the JW Marriott. I explored the JW and was feeling dismayed that my half of the group was headed for the Howard Johnson Plaza instead. Those feelings were dispelled as soon as I entered the HoJo's beautifully appointed lobby which was being decorated for Christmas. My husband and I had two double beds in our room which over-looked busy NanJing road. The room was spacious and comfortable with a tub/shower combination in the bathroom. We had the breakfast buffet at both hotels and the HoJo's beat out the JW in variety, freshness, and ambiance. The location of our hotel was also much more convenient to the city's amenities! This Howard Johnson is nothing like the HoJo's back home! I'd stay here again! "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"It's like a state-owned enterprise - avoid The decoration is good if uninspired. Lots of hotel like this all over China. Nothing special here. But service was just terrible.We had one executive suite and 4 rooms. But we were never told of the $72 special beforehand, so we paid around 30% more. Later, we saw the special prominently advertised at the airport when we were leaving Shanghai!On arrival around 5 pm, we wanted to have a meeting over tea and snacks at the coffee shop for 8 people before we went out to to a trade show. They won't let us have a large table so we can't sit together, saying those were booked for buffet dinner. We were an hour before that and promised to leave before their dinner time. But, no is no. We asked, then, if they can put two small tables together for us. Again, no. When we demanded a reason, the reply was an incredible &quot;We don't do that sort of thing in a grand hotel like this.&quot;We returned late and hoped to catch supper at the Chinese restaurant. Although we were 15 minutes before last order time, they won't let us in. Back to the coffee shop. For 4 of us, they gave us only 2 menus to look at. We requested 2 more, but were ignored by the waitress. So we talked to the manager, who first said he had searched around only there is no other menu around. We told him that can't possibly be right because there were 12 tables of diners and what if any one of them needs a menu? He thought about that, and then gave us a tale about &quot;another department&quot; having borrowed all the menu, even though it was dinner time. Even he felt embarrassed telling it. A minute later he changed his story about having to update the menu, again during dinner time. This was preposterous when a glass of Evian water was $6. We ended up complaining to the hotel's night manager, who of course apologized. He said &quot;now I know what your problem is.&quot; I simply told him, &quot;No, but you know what your hotel's problem is now.&quot;Howard Johnson should go back to doing the budget segment, even in China. In future, we shall avoid this hotel at all cost. Or at least send someone from North America to take a look at this! "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"Not your Usual HoJo! This might be the best kept secret in town for the location and value. Don't get scared off by the HoJo connection, it is a very lovely hotel opened only since 2003. It has one of the best location in Shanghai, just a few steps from the famous walking street - Nanjing Road where you can find everything from Pearl City(great prices and selection) to Silk King(custom made clothing in a day); Pizza Hut to local delicacies. An easy walk to the People's Square and Shanghai museum to the west and 20 min. walk to the Peace Hotel and the Bund to the east. You can even walk to the Yu Garden where the old city is within 30 min. When you first walk in the hotel, the beautiful lobby area immediately tells you it is not your usual HoJo - grand entry way with Italian marble floor. Hotel rooms are modern, spacious and nicely decorated with high speed internet connection; if you can upgrade to the jr. suite, you even have a nice sitting room with TV and other amenities. It also has a very beautiful full service spa and gym. Breakfast is very good with both eastern and western hot and cold selections. In addition, there is an egg station cook to order. Hotel staff are generally helpful and friendly. Once I stay here, it is hard to go to another hotel in Shanghai - you just can't beat the location, and for what you pay for, it is a superb deal! "
howard johnson plaza hotel shanghai ,"They try so hard...... I have stayed in this hotel several times, and each time I get more satisfied than the last. This is not an ostentatious hotel, and neither is it of top-class quality. I am attracted to its superb location (right next to Nanjing East Road). The staff try very hard to please, and I do see their sincerity. But somehow, they just lack that little bit of inspiration you see among service providers at world-class hotels. In terms of facilities, this hotel is more than adequate. To me, this is very much a 4-star plus hotel (though they say it's five), and it attracts lots of Americans familiar with the HoJo brand (and expecting it to be similar to at home, only to be pleasantly surprised). It also attracts a fair bit of local travellers, i.e. Chinese businessmen and tour groups. Not that I dislike such stuff, but having some exclusivity does helps, and this case, it lessens the good experience somewhat... Still, overall an impressive act. Recommended for those seeking a decent place without needing to pay through their nose. "

hua ting hotel towers ,"Beautiful incredible fancy great amenities Simply wow ! This was another wonderful surpirse on my Pacific Delight Tour. Hotel is located a good distance away from the main shopping areas by the river, however it's a good location (only one block to the subway). BTW - the subway system is probably the most beautiful clean and modern in the world. It was a short trip to Pudong. The hotel is also located next to the soccer stadiums that were used for the Olympics and the is a pretty good mall a block away.The lobby is luxurious, staff is amazing. The restaurants are far above what I expexted. There is even a little ice cream shop and a small casual snack restuarant if you just want a casual drink and a sandwich. There is also a luxurious restaurant with entertainment. Business center with very cheap internet. My room wasa spacious and smarlty decorated, bathroom was very large with a large sink and counter. My view was so cool - I could see the stadiums. Don;t miss a ride on the glass elevator at nightime. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Good Value Not great location Stayed here one night on a recent trip to Shanghai. Located just outside the Shanghai Indoor Stadium Station on lines 1 &amp; 4 of the metro. Also close to the sightseeing bus centre at the Shanghai Stadium which was the main reason we booked here. The hotel was a pleasant suprise with a lovely breakfast buffet. Fortunately, it was included in the room rate. As for the central parts of Shanghai, it is a bit inconvenient, but the metro is easy enough to negotiate with signs and maps in English. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Very Good hotel good amenities good food We stayed here as part of our tour group package. Our last day, we had as an exploration day, and the staff recommended that we take a cab to the People's Park, versus taking the nearby subway. It was hot and humid and cab was definitely the way to go, as the hotel is not located in the central part of the city, but who knows what is central anymore as the city has 19 million people and is in the process of constructing for a population of 33 million! The staff was very helpful and the food was excellent. We used the fitness center, which was also very good. There is a pool, but we did not have time for it. It looked fine. The fitness center has windows overlooking one of the many highways that connects to the area and is very good. We found the room to be spacious and comfortable, and the bed comfortable compared to most of the other hotels on our tour. We did stay at a 5-star hotel in Beijing at the beginning of our tour, and this hotel is almost there, but not quite. I'd say a 4 star and a good one. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Clean friendly but nothing spectacular... Not that I was expecting anything spectacular, but the Hua Ting bills itself as a 5-Star hotel. It certainly has the amenities, and is conveniently located near a subway stop, but there's nothing charming about this hotel, and it's located pretty far from downtown. We were there to explore Shanghai and wished we had stayed closer to downtown. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Five Star This is a five star hotel in a remarkable and changing city. It is not centrally located, but is very near the subway. The food and rooms are excellent. Most of the staff speak very good English. To give you an example of the service, one of the guests on our tour found out that their camera batteries were dead. One of the bell people took a taxi, went to a store, found several makes of batteries that would fit, called the guest back and mentioned the brand names and prices, and asked which battery they wanted. This is above and beyond the call of duty. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Helpful Staff ..Great breakfast.. average hotel rooms I've always stayed at this place when in Shanghai. What kept me going back is the location, friendly and helpful staff and good buffet breakfast.I'd like to mention one name particularly and thank her for her service ...I think she is the lobby /assistant lobby manager - TINA. I was running late for an important meeting in another town and needed to take a train and she understood the urgency of the situation and planned everything from getting the tickets to arranging taxi and making sure the taxi driver does his best in getting me out ASAP. The hotel rooms are above average, but the buffet is healthy and pretty good.If you have any questions please feel free to e-mail me at vmail19@yahoo.com "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Great food Best food that I had in China, plenty and very tasty. Excellent hotel (modern design, nice &amp; clean rooms) with a nice view of the Olympic Stadium. The business center had expensive internet rate. Great location, you are next to the Metro (line 1). Nice swimming pool (on the 3rd floor) with sauna, steam room, aerobic. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Very expensive breakfast I have stayed here before and returned due to its location (adjacent to subway line 1) as it was convenient for my meetings in Shanghai. This time the price was higher as I did not enjoy the special pricing of the holidays. More importantly breakfast was not included. The breakfast bufffet is good but the price is outragious. This is by far the most I have paid for breakfast in China. The cost was 340rmb for 2. This is how much I paid for a room at the Crowne Plaza (nicer hotel) including 2 breakfasts a few days later in Changsha!!! If you must stay at this hotel, cross the street and go to Starbucks. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Nice place to stay Stayed at this hotel as part of a Pacific Delights tour. It had the best food of any hotel on the tour. Nice rooms, but the hotel looks a little dated. Overall a very nice experience. "
hua ting hotel towers ,would never stay there again The lobby of this hotel is the best thing it has going for it.The room I was in was old and grubby looking. The carpet was something that I never put my bare feet on. Mold in the bathroom.Hard beds. I asked for an ironing board and the one they sent had a large whole right through the pad.Great breakfasts and they should be for $25 CDN.Stay away from the pizzas. Poor location near the stadium although the subway is right outside the hotel doo.Across the road is a outlet mall with a lot of knock off type storesbut does have a drugstore.This hotel was part of a package tour deal. 
hua ting hotel towers ,"Good Strategic Location Intro- After staying at a couple of hotels more centrally placed (ie next to Yanan Road), I realized i needed one closer to the factory where I visit during my trips located in the zone South of Shanghai.Location and Logistics- This hotel is situated in the South of the main city. It is literally opposite the Shanghai Stadium Complex and at the side of IKEA. It is also a short cab ride down to Xui Jia Huai Shopping Mall intersection (5-6 Malls).- It's next to a couple of Metro Connections which should take you easily to other parts of the city. Taxis are abundant. It is also less tedious for people to reach this hotel from Pudong Airport as its on a road linked to roads leading from Nanpu and Lupu bridges. Rooms and Design- I was in a Superior Room, which means the most basic. The room was very clean, there were no odours and it was equipped with stuff like safe, kettle etc Hot water available.- I'm not N American or European so I find that the the &quot;Stiffer&quot; and non-fluffy bed mattresses are an Asian default thing. Hence I found them not hard or too soft either.- The interior design of the room was standard and was not outdated as many people complained here. It didn't have that &quot;shine&quot; to it but it was not even close to shabby. - The views are of 2 types. I got the view from the back of the hotel which faces a huge empty ground surrounded by a concrete jungle (ie nothing to write home about). The view on the other side of this &quot;S&quot; shaped hotel is very good - facing the amazing stadia complex and couple of interesting buildings.- The lounge, lobby,hotel restaurant, check-in counters are some of the best and grandest I've seen in Asia. Very glittery and eye-catching. The interesting elevator hall lobby is quite nice with 10 super fast elevators available 24hrs.Service/Safety- All my requests over the phone or the counter were met very quickly and quite efficiently. The English language levels are as in most other 5-star hotels here - &quot;getting there&quot;.- As all 5-Star Hotels in Shg, the place is heavily secured with lots of staff and cams. You do have to fend off a couple of pimps once you exit the hotel's compound outside - just walk on and there wont be any problem. Amenities- Since it was winter, I didn't check out these but the breakfast buffet was really good. - A nice 24-Hour Deli serves some good quality bakery items and coffee.- Just outside the hotel (in its corner compound) is a 24 Hour mini-mart useful for buying stuff which costs a lot more in your room fridge.Opinion/Pros/Cons- If you are a busy business traveler whose main job is to visit the industrial zone/offices in the South, this is perfect hotel. In the evening, with less, traffic, once can easily hit Pudong in a taxi.- It is very close to eating places and the Xui jia Huai Shopping Complexes.- If you are lucky, you might catch a concert at the Stadia complex which hosts international acts throughout the year (It was Harry Connick Jr, Celine Dion and Maroon 5 when I was there.)- If you on a romantic holiday or short site seeing trip, this hotel is not very central or ideal to explore Shanghai. Cheers "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Not the best but... I have stayed here a couple of times and, OK, behind the shining foyer the hotel is getting a bit run down but the service has been as good as I have found in the Peoples Republic of China. The rooms are faded but comfortable, and the buffet is good throughout the day, particularly for breakfast. At the price, it is above average. Tourists may want a more central location but the metro is fast, efficient, cheap and just outside the hotel. I'll be back... "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Nice hotel We really enjoyed our stay here and found it to be good value for money. The room was spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable. We were on the 11th floor which had good views of the city. The indoor swimming pool and sauna were good and the staff were helpful. Our only concern was that the location isn't too central but there's a metro station just outside and it was easy to get around the city using this, or by taxi which is cheap. The hotel restaurants were quite expensive so we used the local restaurants and cafes near by instead. The hotel is popular with business people and international tourists. Overall it was a great stay and we felt it offered good value for money. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Happy with Hua Ting Hotel and Towers We were part of a Pacific Delight Tours group and this was the first hotel on the 13 day itinerary. Our stay was brief as we arrived late on a Friday evening, went touring all day Saturday and checked out early Sunday morning.Two Shanghai stadiums are across the way including the venue for the 2008 Olympic (Women's I think) soccer.We were quite pleased with the property overall. We had non-smoking and recently remodeled rooms on the 14th floor. The rooms featured a large 32&quot; LCD TV, good lighting, ethernet port (did not have time to use), nice bath lotions etc. Fitness room was great as well as the indoor pool, sauna and hot tub.Very good breakfast buffet with a good selection of Western as well as Asian menu items.The center of town can be easily reached by subway or a 25-30 minute cab ride away.By the way, there's a nice department store across the road called Foxtown. If you are hungry go to the basment level for the food court and you will find about 10 different inexpensive food venues. We had a dinner for four around $10 US! There's also a McDonald's in there as well as a Papa John's.Wish we had a chance to stay there longer. Maybe next time. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Called 5 star but I don't think so This was our final stop on our &quot;Return to China&quot; tour before heading to Hong Kong. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby is quite lovely as are the common areas on the floors. But this is where the 5 star rating ended as far as I'm concerned. My daughter and I were traveling with friends on a group tour so we had adjoining rooms. It was quite obvious that the adjoining doors had not been opened in a very, very long time as the area between the doors was filthy!! I understand stains and such in hotels but this was just filth and the staff had opened the doors so unless they were blind, they just didn't care. Mold was also a problem in the bathroom but the thing that grossed me out the worse was when we used the bathrobes they provided. I assumed when I put the robe on that it was clean. After having it on for a minute or two, I couldn't seem to get the scent of men's cologne out of my head. I finally realized it was coming from the robe!! Obviously the guest before us had used the robe too, hung it up and housekeeping never changed them out!! Needless to say, I called the manager about this who seemed totally unconcerned and unable to understand my discomfort. I asked that housekeeping bring 4 clean robes to our 2 rooms and took another shower in our moldy bathroom. The spa and pool areas are quite nice (and mold free) but the hotel as a whole caters much more to the business crowd then to a group like ours. So when we went for a swim and even though we were the only ones in the pool, the attendant kept coming in looking annoyed. In fact, out of every hotel we stayed in on our trip, the staff at this hotel was the least friendly and the least helpful. The hotel does have a very extensive breakfast buffet that was excellent. We also had lunch at the small cafe in the lobby but it was very over priced and not very good. And again, they are definitely used to catering to the business crowd as the menu choices were not very child friendly. I'm sure the tour company we were with uses this hotel because the time the group is in Shanghai falls on the weekend and conferences and such are not going on. It just happened that we changed our itinerary to get an extra day in Shanghai and ended up arriving there on a Friday while the rest of the group arrived the next day. The location is very far from the Bund and the Yuyuan gardens but since we were on a tour, this didn't matter much as transportation was taken care of. It just took a long time to get anywhere. There is a Quik-Mart right outside the hotel and a small grocery store just down the street so we were able to get drinks and snacks for the kids. And tucked back behind the stores, amongst the construction that is going on all around the hotel, there is a wonderful little resturant we went to called Xiao Ting. Walk out the front door, take a left and it's a little house that looks like it doesn't belong ther and it was absolutely wonderful!! That was our last dinner with some of the people from our group and so very close to the hotel! "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Nice Hotel so-so location We stayed here on a Pacific Delight tour. The hotel was nice, probably the best of the bunch in the tour. The only gripe I had was the hotel location - it was always a 15-30 min cab ride to anywhere; good thing the cabs are so cheap in China! Good stuff: Great breakfast, there is a nice Dim Sum place next to this. There is a quick mart for stuff a lot cheaper than the mini bar just outside the door. There is a subway stop just outside, there is a bus station for day trips just outside. The room and comfort. Staff.Bad stuff: location, location, location. It is far from Bund, YuYuan gardens, Quipo Lu (shopping), and almost everything else. If this were closer, it would be a great place to stay for cheap (but then again it would cost more)... "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Good business and conference location Good, large and clean. Large rooms. I wasnt able to check the fitness and spa area though. The breakfast buffet is opulent, from Asian noodles and dimsums to eggs in all variations. An all-night bistro provides pizzas and noodles, good to survive a conference. The lobby staff tends to be a little stressed and understaffed at most of the time. Queuing is likely here.You have to ignore the frequent girl traffic at night passing between lobby and the lifts. They wont bother you if you dont bother them. Cant judge acc. to price as I didnt pay the bill. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel from 1st of April 2007 till the 4th of April to attend an exhibition at the &quot;Everbright center&quot; it was excellentlylocated next to the exhibiton (less than 10 min. with Taxi), I had a room at the executive floor, the room is so normal but with lovely view (floor 26), the staff at the executive floor are super excellent; so friendly so helpfull well trained to deal with businesstravellers, the room price include, wireless internet, coffee and teaat any time plus breakfast and snacks, and a business center &amp; dry clean, I bet it was worth paying the extra for executive floor. The only thing I missed was being able to walk around in the evenings without taking the underground or a Taxi, there's not much to do at this area (not so touristic like Nanjing) although there's some malls2 underground stations away, but Nanjing is much better..... "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Mold ruined my stay. Hotel Guest from November 30 to December 5, 2006When your car pulls up to the luxurious looking Hua Ting Hotel &amp; Towers, you think you have made an excellent choice for an incredibly reasonable price. The lobby is bustling with international travellers.......the marble floors are glistening and the water fountains are dancing.....definitely a 5 star feeling on the first floor. When you check in to your room, your heart will sink because you will find a bathroom that has black mold everywhere. The rooms have seen better days.......they have all the necessities, but are showing signs of wear. The 2 rooms I experienced (I requested a room change due to too much mold and overheating) were unacceptable. I am sure the carpets have never been cleaned!!! I have travelled all over the world and have stayed in all levels of hotels. I have never experienced such incongruities in presentation..........outside your room the hotel is palatial and spotlessly clean....inside your room you want to call the health officials!!! This is not just my bad luck. I spoke with several other hotel guests during my stay and they all complained of varying levels of mold and dirty carpets. Unfortunately for me, I am highly allergic to mold and during my stay my respiratory system was compromised. The buffet breakfast on the main floor is absolutely incredible.All the food is beautifully prepared and displayed....delicious!! The main bathroom off the lobby was spectacular.....if only I could have booked that room for my stay!I did speak with the concierge about the problems. I sent an email to the management of the hotel and a copy to the Preferred Hotel Group that has the Hua Ting within its group. I did receive a response from the director of Preferred Hotel Group and she said she would look into the problem. I would certainly call the hotel directly before committing to booking a room.Rosamund ParkinsonMontreal, Canada "
hua ting hotel towers ,"Amazing Hotel! This hotel was simply amazing! The rooms were immaculate, the beds were clean and comfortable and the breakfasts offered so much variety (both Chinese and Western style). I loved the location though... it is steps away from the metro, 711, and right across from the Fox outlet mall. I would definitely stay here again. We arrived at this hotel after being in a cramped room on the Princess Elaine for the 3 gorges tour. We felt like royalty!!! p.s. If you take the metro to go to the pedestrian shopping area, take the #1 and #2 but make sure you remember your entrance. If you don't, upon your return, you will have a long way to walk to get back to your hotel. "
hua ting hotel towers ,"5 stars? I think not Somehow, this hotel cannot count. It is nowhere near a 5 star International hotel. My initial room internet did not work, toilet did not work and aircon did not work. They moved me to another room where my aircon did not work. Food is average and very expensive. Unfortunately for this hotel, I am a very frequent traveller. They need to improve considerably to be able to classify themselves as 5 stars. "
hua ting hotel towers ,Good Hotel Our room was large and comfortable. The bathroom was well-equipped and spotless (it could use a better ventilation system.)The buffet breakfast was excellent but the coffee machine was confusing for some people and led to occasional lines. We found the staff friendly and helpful. The Metro station is right outside the front door and you can be in the center of Shanghai in 15 minutes but if you like to get out and walk around a city a more central location would be a better choice. 
hua ting hotel towers ,"Mixed feeling Hua Ting Hotel &amp; Towers used to be Sheraton but is now owned by a chinese group. Although the hotel is not the newest, the first impression is good, certainly not run down. Most impressive is the big elevator tower which always guarantees quick ascents and descents, also to the top floor restaurant.Its setting is, near Shanghai Stadium, is somewhat remote from the city center but an underground station is in front of the entrance. In no time you´re on Hengshan or Huahuai road. Not difficult to get a taxi either.On average the price for a room is lower than other 4-5 star hotels so it would have been a good deal. That is until a saw a cockroach emerging from under my bed cover just before a left my room for the last time! Probably an incident but not something to happen in an hotel of this stature. Will think twice to book again. "

hyatt on the bund ,"Best View of Pudong and Bund This is my first review, however, i consider myself to be a traveler. I have stayed in the hotel several times, 3 times to be exact. Many of the reviews are inline with my my views. LOBBYThe lobby is spacious and open. But because the function rooms are on the same floor, it can get busy but not crowded when there is an event, as it is in the back of the lobby. VIEW / BUND SUITEThe view is fantastic, only if you get a room with a riverview, however, due to the shape and design of the building, it can be tricky to get a view. The best view is reserved for Bund suite, and floors higher than 12th. The bund suite provides you with a 180 degree panoramic views, providing you with views of Pudong and the Bund. The layout is very nice and trendy, High tech, and very comfortable beds. Everything about the Bund Suite says, dont leave the room. OTHER ROOMSHowever the other rooms have less view. its either city view, or Bund view. If your room happens to be close the elevators, then your view is restricted. If your room is closer to the bund suite (and on the eastern tower) you will be able to getter a much better view (make sure its a riverview room). However, once in the room, and not taking the view in your criteria, the rooms are very nice, relaxing and comfortable. Try to get rooms from the 16th floors and above.If you get a club room, i wouldnt bother with the breakfast in the club lounge, go the restaurant on the western tower-level 2. I must say it has one of the best breakfast buffets but the lunch and dinner can do with more improvement, however, its still better than most 5 star hotels lunch/dinner buffets out there. The Restaurant on the second to last floor on western tower, is extremely over-priced, while the food is good, i wouldnt say its value for money. The Chinese restaurant on the lobby floor is nice, but slightly over-priced.Top floor (western tower) Terrace: That is a must see feature, whether you stay at the hotel or not. bring your camera, and shoot away at night. However, I recommend you make a reservation, even if its for 30 mins or less. The staff at the terrace bar, can be non-accommodating and say its reserved. waited before for 30 mins, and still no customers came. I just wanted to take pictures. Btw, shanghai lights are dimmed or turned of at 10pm, so if you want amazing pictures of the lights of shanghai, go beforeSTAFFDuring my 3 stays, i havent found any fault with any staff member, from the front desk to the housekeeping, however, the concierge, while the provide detailed information, never seem to have a smile on their face. but overall, not much complaints in that area either. OUTSIDEYes, currently there is a lot of construction around the hotel. However, anywhere on the bund has construction! until the World expo begins in May 2010, shanghai is a construction site, not just next to the hotel. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Fantastic view The room was large with a small seating area (two small armchairs with footrests) and a fantastic view over looking the Bund and Pudong. It was fun watching the boats drift by on the river. At night all the buildings are lit up which is fun and you get a wonderful view from the rooftop bar. The bed wasn't too bad or maybe I had acclimatised to hard beds after nearly three weeks in China. However they had the hardest pillows of the entire trip! I found the light switches bewildering. I was unable to turn the lights on in the bathroom or loo on the first night. The light switches are on almost every wall and what makes it even more difficult is that you have to press them in a certain way for them to turn on. So no wonder it is so hard to find the right one. The loo blocked on the first night but it was fixed the following day and thereafter worked fine. There was no shaving/vanity mirror and the sink was a little small with the tap slightly too close to the bottom of the sink but that's just the modern style. There was a nice big flat screen TV and a DVD player which played region 2 DVDs (Europe) which was very nice as well as an MP3 player. Typically internet access in their business centre was NOT free which is surprising given the cost of the room but seems standard in China. Also, breakfast, although extensive and very good was an eye watering twenty two pounds per person! For that there was lots of fruit, waffles, croissants, pastries, freshly cooked eggs as well as Chinese food.Reception was efficient and courteous and for once I was greated politely (unlike other places in my trip) and the room reservation was confirmed. I was not disturbed by the building noise going as a result of Expo 2010 and I was only on 10th floor. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Best view in town The riverside of the Bund is in complete construction and won't be ready until the World Expo 2010. Unless you are willing to walk through the construction, you may want to wait until then to choose this hotel. However, the river view rooms offer the best views of the Huang Pu with its constant and fascinating traffic. The rooms are spacious and modern and the service excellent. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Love this hotel although Expo construction sometimes a pain I'm a very frequent traveller to Shanghai and typically stay at the Hyatt on the Bund. Have also stayed multiple times at Grand Hyatt, Westin on Bund, Pudong Shangri-La all of which are also lovely in their own way. I stay here because of the combo of Club lounge, service, views, proximity to Bund, and gym. The club lounge serves a nice breakfast with eggs to order and the evening cocktail hours is also nicely done. I also use the meeting rooms frequently and found them to also be first rate. The gym is quite large for a hotel and is rarely used by guests (not sure why). Pool also large for a hotel. The regular rooms are nice, clean, well furnished and very pleasing to the eye as well as functional for business needs. Love the teas that are in the room and always bring them home for my wife.When I travel to Shanghai with my wife I typically try to upgrade to a Bund River Suite which is AMAZING. Wall of windows onto the river, telescope, comfy chairs, bathroom and dressing area the size of a studio apartment, bar area, etc. The only con is the construction going on in the vicinity. This is somewhat impossible to predict visit to visit although I typically always leave additional time when going somewhere in Shanghai as traffic going anywhere is impossible to predict. The bar on the top floor also has amazing views and believe it or not, an outdoor hot tub surrounded by lounge area. I will have to try this sometime but haven't yet figured out how to do this without walking through the bar in my swim suit. "
hyatt on the bund ,"The Best View Hotel in Shanghai Probably the newsiest 5-star hotel in Puxi (but Peninsular will open next week). Location: It’s on the being developed North Bund, not on the “old” Bund. However, the “old” Bund is only a bridge or a 5-min walk away. Since walking through that bridge is a tourist attraction anyway, the location it is actually quite good, particularly once the nearby construction is finished (before Expo 2010?). We didn’t have any problem to get the taxi, as more and more drivers know existence of this hotel. Facility: Although it’s a Regency grade Hyatt (we didn’t know when booking), it can easily match or beat any Grand Hyatt in US we have been to. We had the river view room on 20th floor. The view was incredible, when and only when the weather is good or the sky is clear (not always). There are only 8 rooms on each higher floor with the river view (note the view is not really for the river, rather the lighted buildings or architectures on both side of the river). Most of these 8 rooms have the view of Puxi and the Bund; two have the view of Pudong. One, which is a suite, is at the tip of the building and has the best view: both Pudong and Puxi (probably, the only room in Shanghai has that view)! Restaurant: we did try the buffet on the 2nd floor (just arrived and didn’t want to go out), which was good. It appeared all foods (Japanese, Italian, continental and Shanghaiese) were prepared real time in an open kitchen setting. The bar on the roof top has the best view (the same as the suites). The music played by DJ (different DJ/different night) was OK. If one doesn’t stay in the river view room, it’s worth to get a $10 or more drink and enjoy the view. Service: The services were very good and as expected for a 5-star Shanghai hotel (or a 4-star US hotel). Check-in was a little slow (we hit a bad time, one staff for an airline crew, one for a Japanese tour group and another for rest of us). Many staff were friendly and some are getting experiences (the hotel is about 2 YO). The young man at the business count was not as attentive as the young lady in the back. Overall, it’s a very nice hotel and should be on everyone‘s list when looking for a Shanghai hotel. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Hyatt on the Bund is not on the Bund and other unfulfilled promises Location not optimal as the Hyatt on the Bund is not on the Bund but 5 min walking from the Bund, and the Bund itself is a construction area for the World Expo in 2010. At check-in I asked for an upgrade to a clubroom as I was promised that would entitle me to a room with a nice view: I got a view on a wall at one side, a parking place in front and a little further the river, but not the Bund site. The club is located on the 3rd floor; no view, limited breakfast choice, and employees that seem to wonder what I was doing there and eagerly took away the saucer when I drank my cup of coffee. I requested to be downgraded to the business package as the extra club charge is not worth it. I was re-allocated to a smoking room, although I asked for non-smoking in reservation and, detail, newspaper included in my package not delivered. Upon my complaint at the reception I was told that they would inform the manager and that next time I would hopefully have a better experience with them. Well, don’t think there will be a next time. The reason I give an overall rating of 3 on 5 is that hotel is clean, rooms big and staff in general friendly and service minded and that the Vue bar made up for the irritations: fabulous view and great staff, certainly go there!Tip in case you stay here: ask for a room in the Western Tower as that gives you the nice view on the City and the Bund (the clubrooms are in the Eastern tower and view on the boring side). "
hyatt on the bund ,"Fabulous Hotel bad timing. For the summer of 2009, there couldn't be possibly a worse location in Shanghai. Due to the impending Expo 2010, apparently Shanghai is getting a brand new infrastructure. Sadly, Hyatt on the Bund is a victim of this. Fabulous hotel, attentive staff but just outside the front door appears to be the largest city wide construction project ever. The city, in particular The Bund, is undergoing an extensive and intensive infrastructure replacement, virtually a new city in 9 months. Very difficult area to walk in, cab rides very slow and expensive due to construction, not a good neighborhood. Sadly, great hotel but lousy location. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Amazing stylish haven... GORGEOUS Now THIS is more like it. China is increasingly setting the pace when it comes to luxury hotels. The Hyatt on the Bund is more like a Park Hyatt than a Hyatt. Beautifully designed, it has all the amazing touches that one would expect at a &quot;W&quot; with the convenience and value of the Hyatt brand. My family and I loved the place and there's very little that we'd put in the &quot;con&quot; column. Perhaps the pool is too small, perhaps the location's a little strange (but it's very close to the Bund) but all this is silly when considering what a great hotel this is. If you love modern luxury with excellent food and service, look no further. I wish I were back! "
hyatt on the bund ,"Quite a fabulous room A Hyatt in the new idiom of cool, clean lines,minamalist. Service as expected from Hyatt is excellent. The rooms are the star. Even those rooms not facing the Bund are looking over the Huangpu river and to Pudong and the Pearl TV Tower still memorable.The room is huge. Flat screen TV on articulating mount. Fair size desk and work chair, with the requisite power plugs that include North America plugs, internet and halogenlamp. Small chair with ottoman. Neutral tones. Floor to ceiling windows. Powered curtains and shades.Design is most impressive. Two sliding/moving panels open to expose the stand alone vanity and sink, the separate toilet and separate bathtub &amp; rain head shower. The 2 panels are mirrored on one side. See pictures. Words donot suffice to describe this delightful room...Location is a plus and a minus. Walking across the famed bridge over Soochow creek(where the classic Broadway Mansion sits) onto the top of the iconic Bund is a must.Minus is that location is in a nowhere land. Many taxi drivers had a bit of difficultyfinding this hotel. The Bund is now a dusty mess as construction is underway for Shanghai World Expo 2010 that will be at the other end of the Bund.Note in China access to the internet is expensive.Buffet befits the Hyatt brand;. Didnot have the opportunity to try all of the facilities.A 5 star quality room for China. I would stay despite the location for the qualityof service and the ROOM. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Luxury plus We had 4 nights at the Hyatt on the Bund in April this year, it was a wonderful hotel and everything was spot on. Its just a 10 minutes walk from the Bund and main shops but the magna train currently stops well short of the Bund I misunderstood when it said take a taxi from the train startion to the hotel and so our ride cost a fortune!! so if you are taking the mag train then also take the normal train to the nearer station and that is just a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel pool is fantastic with very attentive staff looking after you. There is a bar at the top of the hotel that you can look down onto the water and watch the parade of boats at night and there is a choice of restaurants ( not much choice of other restaurants near to the hotel although there was a very good Italian opposite that is not very obvious) It was expensive but after doing my homework discovered that some hotels in Shanghai have shared facilities and beds can be smaller in length and hard as is preferred in China. This hotel had big fluffy European sized beds and all the extras you would expect from this standard of hotel. Highly reccommended expensive but if you dont stay first class your kids will later ;-) It seemed like Shanghai was being totally renovated lots of road works (World Expo in 2010) this made it dusty all over the city and with the afternoon smog my photos told the tale that was not so obvious when we were there. "
hyatt on the bund ,"An excellent world class option in Shanghai I have always been partial to a Hyatt and when Hyatt on the Bund opened up, I couldn't wait to try it.First, the location. The Bund translates to two things in my book. Great views and lots of traffic if you need to go across the river.The hotel was relatively new when I stayed and consequently everything was in perfect condition. The lower level lobby is really interesting and a nice place for a coffee.The rooms are large and bigger than the traditional hotels in Shanghai. The Hyatt here has an interesting concept where the bathroom is actually seperated from the main room primarily by movable screens/doors. Its great if you are travelling solo but probably not if with your family.The Club lounge is very cosy and has a good variety of drinks and snacks. It actually feels like a members only club. The restaurants are good and the food is nice without being exceptional.The buffet breakfast is really worth the price.And yes, you do get the excellent Hyatt service that one would expect from this brand.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. "
hyatt on the bund ,"locationlocationlocation As staff for a major airline, we just relocated to the Hyatt. Beautiful hotel, but the location is good if your business includes work at The Russian Embassy. It is across the street! This area will be redeveloped, but probably not soon enough for most. Bus stops a street over, but the hotel staff doesn't seem to know how to help navigate with route numbers. Hotel has obviously stripped our rooms of the goodies others mentioned, but our rooms didn't even include a clocks. If coming for the Expo 2010, you could stay most anywhere else and be closer. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Great hotel for leisure but location is not ideal for business meetings Stayed for three nights at the hotel in last March. As other reviews havve mentioned, the level of service and the views are excellent. I did not try the restaurants but the Vue is a great place to get a drink.The big drawback, and it is a significant one, is the location, being situated in a somewhat isolated and uninteresting neighborhood. Taxis can also be a bit tricky to find at times, although at least more drivers know about the hotel now.Rooms are decent size, although it would be nicer if the std rooms had a couch to watch the TV onIf you have the leisure time and want to stay at a place with fantastic views, would recommend this hotel. If you have a number of business meetings though, you would probably be better off staying at one of the more centrally located hotels such as the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton "
hyatt on the bund ,"Excellent! Me and a co-worker stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund for 3 nites! I recommend getting a room with river view! it is worth it! The SPA is the best, uncrowded, nice 25 mt swiming pool and great steam room and sauna!! "
hyatt on the bund ,"Best Hotel In Shanghai Just back from the Hyatt on the Bund! All I can say is this is THE HOTEL to stay at when you visit this beautiful city. The hotel &amp; staff is top notch...I don't even know where to begin - it is so incredible!!!! We had one of the club rooms that was on the 26th floor. From the moment you enter the room it is breathtaking. HUGE floor to ceiling windows with the most amazing view of the Bund. The lights at night were just incredible. Gorgeous bed, huge beautiful bathroom, shower and a kit with every kind of soap, shampoo, lotion that you want. Bathrobes with slippers, flat screen tv, bottled water, mini-bar, cd player - you name it - the room had it - just first class all the way. The hotel even had a small birthday cake for my husband in the room when we checked in. Amazing service. With the club room you get the breakfast buffet and evening cocktail service that was so good. The only way to go. You have your own private club room on the 3rd floor with laptops, tv/news, new papers, bottled water, coffee, juices, fruit and every type of breakfast foods that you want. The evening cocktail hour was incredible - a full bar available for you that is included in the club room price. Great wines, beers and any other cocktail that you wanted. So nice to sit there at night and have a cocktail and look out at the Bund and the lights. This hotel is not right on the Bund but it does have the best view possible!!! Cabs are very very cheap and this hotel is located in a good location that takes only minutes to get anywhere and only for about $2.00 to $3.00. We had an amazing time at this beautiful hotel. They also have a huge indoor pool with spa downstairs and that was also very nice. The staff is very well trained and will do anything for you. It was an amazing experience and this is the only hotel to even consider if you are going to Shanghai. Please feel free to email me if I can answer any more questions. The Hyatt on the Bund is #1!!! Thank you Hyatt for an amazing time! "
hyatt on the bund ,"Good view modern and comfortable hotel to stay in SH Good:1) the staffs are very helpful and nice.2) the room is very comfortable and big, I appreciate the design of the bathroom area, it is very nice3) there is a ipod player in the room, very impressing...4) happy with the breakfast buffet, many choices and the taste is good5) the view is fantasticRoom to improve:1) there is a computer center on the lobby floor, but it charges RMB40 per 15 mins of internet access. I didn't expect there is charge for using the computer + internet2) the location is a bit out of the central district, no bus or MTR nearby. but taking taxi is cheap, so I think it is not a big problem to me. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Great hotel Hotel looks very new and is only one year old. Rooms are modern and very comfortable. Hotel is a 5 min taxi ride from the main bund area, but I just walked it in 15 min. You really have to learn how to find your way to/from the hotel, but if you are not comfortable walking the short distance, a taxi is only about $2. Due to its location just away from the main Bund area, it is particularly interesting if the hotel prices out a bit lower than its competitors because of the inexpensive taxi ride to the main area. F&amp;B was very good and so was the healtclub and indoor pool area. Beware when visiting Shanghai and Bejing about the tea and art scams that exist!! I got fooled by the tea scam and even though I didn't mind the money I lost it was still an unpleasant experience. Google these scams and you will learn more about it. They are exceptionally good at it I have to say! "
hyatt on the bund ,"King of the Bund I recently stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund for three nights Nov 10-13 using my Faster Free Nights as a Goldpassport Diamond Member. After staying at other properties on previous visits to Shanghai which includes the Grand Hyatt at Jin Mao and the St. Regis Hotel in Pudong, I must admit that this is now my favorite property.Concierge Lounge: Upon check-in, the staff identified my status and escorted me to their concierge lounge (Bund Club on the 3rd Floor) where there were staff that registered me and assigned a deluxe king room. I was given full lounge access as a diamond member and provided an amenity which consisted of three apples. The lounge has a decent breakfast which includes both American and Chinese offerings. During the evening, they offered hot &amp; cold appetizers, light deserts and cocktails which I definitely took advantage of. Dining: I checked out their Chinese Kitchen restaurant named Xindalu. Here I sampled their Peking Duck which was nicely prepared and delicious. The staff was friendly and paid attention to my needs. Their Hot and Sour soup was good albeit a bit spicier than I’m used to back in the U.S.Spa: What an experience! I’m not a spa expert, but I absolutely enjoyed this experience. From the quality of the bathrobes and soaking tub to the oversized room where I received a deep tissue body and foot massage, this was an added plus to my stay.Health Club: I often judge hotels based on their club facilities. If this is the case, then Hyatt on the Bund is King. I liked that they had all the newest and latest equipment which included tv monitors on all cardio equipment, star tac circuit training equipment and free weights. I worked out here every morning. No one knew what a red bull energy drink is but that's okay.Room: I stayed in a deluxe king bedroom. It had the flat screen LCD with HBO, Cinemax, Stars and CNN for English channels plus a DVD player. The all marble bath with sliding doors and separate shower/bath was nicely designed. I had a great view of the Bund.Area for Improvement: Not much. They could use an ATM in the hotel and some wireless internet in the room versus the Ethernet connection. Maybe the distance is something to be desired from the tourist part of the Bund. There is nothing within walking distance that I wished to explore. But, taxis are plentiful and inexpensive. Overall I would definitely consider staying at this 5 star property again. Even if I was a full paying customer, I would come back. I’m off to the new Park Hyatt Shanghai for two more nights before returning to the U.S. We’ll see if this new property takes the title of All Time Favorite play to stay in Shanghai. "
hyatt on the bund ,"The Best Views in Shanghai An oasis of calm in the bustling mayhem of Shanghai. I always book an executive club room for the little touches - free cocktails overlooking the towers of Pudong, the selection of teas in the room and free internet access - and overall it saves money if you make use of the club lounge.The top floor French restaurant is worth the trip for the views of the Bund alone, and a little piece of Parisian food if you fancy a (pricey) change from Chinese cuisine, "
hyatt on the bund ,"A Great Hotel and My Preferred Choice in Shanghai What a fantastic stay we had at the Hyatt on the Bund. We were there for three nights/four days and loved the layout. The spa facility is top notch. I used the spa all three mornings and everything from the locker room to the pool to the treadmills were outstanding. I do wish the that the tub in the pool area was hot, but I am picking here.The room is a gorgeous layout with a wonderful two head shower. The room service was fast on delivery and pickups. The Executive club I highly recommend, they have a fantastic selection for breakfast and the coffee and teas are great. The views are amazing in this hotel, especially from The Vue Restaurant(food is very good and will improve with time i am sure, but falls just short of great in my opinion) and The Vue Bar on the 30th and 31st floors.Check in and Check out are easy with a very attentive staff that will greet you as you walk to check in, or pull you from a line if you happen to be waiting. This has easily become my first choice hotel in Shanghai.The NegativeNo duel gender hot tub. There are sooooo many light switches in the room. It makes it very difficult to locate them all and go to bed. Only 4 elevators for a tower of 30 floors was a poor design. You are usually waiting for one for a bit. "
hyatt on the bund ,"For Amazing Views this is the Hotel Here is a truly first class Hotel in every way in an unbeatable location. The Hotel is modern minimalist throughout with a quality feel to all the fixtures &amp; fittings. We had a River View King room &amp; on check-in asked whether we would have a good view of the Huangpu River and across to Pudong. The check-in agent didn’t think our allocated room would have, and spent a while whilst we relaxed with a drink in the café (at their expense) arranging a room on a high floor with a great view for us. This Hotel is all about views and if you were not on a high floor it just wouldn’t be the same. Some of the low floor rooms wouldn’t be high enough to clear the ugly Cruise boat terminal across the road on the Riverbank.Hotel Pros:Comfortable, attractive rooms with a large walk in shower &amp; a bath if required. On first glance the room appears Spartan but on closer inspection it is all there, just concealed so nothing looks untidy to destroy the minimalist appearance. There is even a choice of 3 fresh China Tea’s &amp; a special Teapot to make them in. You have a small bookshelf with several books concerning the History of The Bund &amp; all the usual Hotel magazines &amp; books. The floor to ceiling windows afford the most amazing view of the futuristic new city of Pudong and the many boats travelling down the Huangpu River. When you have had enough of the view an electric blind completely shuts out all light completely.The location of the Hotel is both good &amp; OK. It definitely has the best view from its corner of the river location across to Pudong &amp; back towards the Bund. However it is not “on the Bund” as such and you will need to walk through an ordinary area for 15 minutes to get to “The Bund” We did this on several occasions &amp; once when it was raining &amp; noted a distinct lack of shelter from the rain.The “Vue” Bar on the 32nd floor must have the best view of a cityscape anywhere. It is so totally amazing it bowls you over &amp; the drinks are not that bad either. You can actually go outside onto the roof &amp; lie on a lounger, even have a spa whilst you sip on your G &amp; T! One floor below is the “Vue” Restaurant &amp; we were lucky enough to have the premium table right at the end of the room on the riverfront. Once again, the view was just unbelievable – especially with all the lights on across in Pudong &amp; along the Bund. You really do have a ringside seat here. The food was top notch, we had Beef Wellington &amp; it was perfection. The price is high but you would expect that. Of course, the service is faultless but this applies everywhere in the Hotel.Hotel Cons:In June when we were here it was extremely Hot &amp; Humid &amp; the room A/C didn’t seem to be able to keep up with it. At times whilst trying to sleep it was just so hot. I don’t know if this was just a problem with the room we were in or not.There seems to be a shortage of Taxis in this area. We had reservations for dinner at “M” on The Bund (Fabulous) one night &amp; went down to the Lobby 40 minutes before our reserved time. We had to wait for 30 minutes for a taxi in a queue &amp; ended up only just making the reserved time at the Restaurant. If you have an important engagement I would suggest you arranging a Hotel car to ensure you make it.If you want to be near shops this is about a 40 minute walk from East Nanjing Rd, you really have to take a Cab there &amp; if you want a big choice of places to eat near the hotel this might not be the place for you.For a special treat this Hotel is unbeatable.

hyatt on the bund ,"Great hotel Expect plush towels, comfortable bed, high ceiling and trendy decor at an excellent hotel near the bund. There were, however, several areas of improvement - 1) the fridge is tiny. I got a cake from their Tea Room (chocolate - excellent!!) and wanted to keep it in my room. The fridge was half of most you would expect at hotels and I had to keep the cake with room services. 2) No free wifi. In fact, internet is only available via cable and costs around CNY 5/minute. Since free wifi is pretty much a standard now, I was disappointed to find this upon checking in.Vue Restaurant - very good. The place looks like a spacious library/kitchen. The food, most prepared in their stage kitchen, was excellent. From a simple champagne risotto, chilled seafood platter (really fresh) and steak, everything was prepared well. Their was a complimentary dessert - chocolate bonbon, served on dry ice, which was a nice touch.China Kitchen - I had dinner there before, which was good, but not great considering all the excellent Chinese cuisine in Shanghai. For lunch, we had traditional beef noodles, appetizer dishes (come in 4 varieties) , which were all below average. Aside from the Peking Duck, I would not recommend anything else at this restaurant. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Fantastic Hotel ! I stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund for 2 night on a short trip to Shanghai. At first I wanted to book the Grand Hyatt in Pudong but changed my mind due to the price (twice higher).No regrets !! This hotel was fantastic from A to Z: my room was beautilul (and I just booked a standard view room), very new and design, state of the art facilities, amazing views on the Bund AND Pudong, efficient service (very friendly as well). The restaurant and the bar on the last floors are spectacular (and probably offer the best views you can get in Shanghai... however you need to book in advande) the food was good yet quite expensive.Some previous reviews mention about a disapointing location. Yes the hotel isn't exactly on the Bund, you have to cross a bridge but anyway all hotels in Shanghai require to take a taxi in order to go to all the main attractions.Unfortunatly i didn't get the chance to try the Spa and the pool as I was too busy visiting the great city that is Shanghai.All in all, if I get the chance to go back to Shanghai, I would definitly stay again at the Hyatt on the Bund. "
hyatt on the bund ,Great Hotel Great value for money. The view from the rooms is just gorgeous!!! 
hyatt on the bund ,"Great stay but not most convenient location I stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund for 2 nights in April 08. The hotel is immaculate and clean, very modern and the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. I travel throughout China 20 weeks per year, and both times that I have been fortunate enough to stay at a Hyatt (the other being in Beijing) I have been more than pleased and impressed with the level of service I received.Only downside of this hotel is that you have to take a taxi across the Suzhou River to get to the trendier sites and locations. If you can stay near the &quot;Bund Hotel&quot; you will be better off as far as walking to attractions and restaurants. Otherwise, it's a short ride to most sites from the Hyatt.The rooms are clean, modern and beautiful. Remote powered shades let you view the Bund from your bed, but close the shades for privacy just before getting some shut eye. The bar at the top of the restaurant (Vue Bar) has an AWESOME must see terrace. It has lounge beds w/ canopies and a hot tub. You can sip martinis and take in an amazing view (or Vue as they catchily put it).The breakfast at Aroma is pricey, but definitely worth at least one try. They have quite a spread and all of it is great. Skip the Xindali restaurant. It is nice, but you can get much much better Chinese food outside for a fraction of the price. Incidentally, the Hyatt in Beijing has an identical restaurant which I ate at and left w/ the same feeling of having a very small Peking Duck at a very high price tag. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Good but let down by location and layout Stayed here for 3 nights after a work conference at the Shangri-La. A number of other people have already said they had trouble getting their taxi driver to find the Hyatt, as it's so new - I had the same problem getting to the hotel from Pudong, and several other times during my stay. It feels a little like the Hyatt has landed from outer space in a rather dusty and quiet area. It's actually on the same road (about 3 minutes away) from the Astor Hotel, which has been around for years - would recommend perhaps mentioning that to taxi drivers if they don't know where they're going? Inside the hotel, it's all quite good on first impressions - the lobby is massive - feels a bit like an airport terminal building with chillout music playing in the background. Had a standard room in the East wing. It all feels a bit Japanese inside - warm woods and minimalist. The layout of the standard rooms is a bit of a problem, though - the bathroom area is actually open plan, with silding partitions to divide it off for privacy. A bit weird, but alright. But there's no proper wardrobe - just a hanging area in the bathroom, with some drawers, which is a bit awkward to get access to, and overly fiddly and annoying. Had breakfast in the Aroma restaurant - good selection as you'd expect, but the staff were overly keen to clear things away before we'd finished them. Gym and pool in the basement are amazing - vitually empty every time I went, which was even better. Not a very good free weight selection, though. The bar on the top floor (Vue) is alright - good views of both Pudong and the Bund because of where the hotel is located. If you want to look at the pretty view, remember that the lights in both Pudong and the Bund are turned off fairly early in the evening. Not much of a buzz though, compared to say the Jade36 bar in the Pudong Shangri-La - suspect because this place is a little out of the way. Concierge was helpful - they got us a great table at the Jean-Georges restaurant on the Bund - would recommend the tasting menu if you go there (RMB900). But the concierge also recommended a complete dump of a place when we said we wanted to go and buy some jewellery - they sent us to this tourist trap in Jingan - avoid like the plague if they recommend to you too. Overall, a good hotel, but the location isn't great. It's not too far from the Bund - maybe about 10-15 minutes, but the walk there is a little dusty and ropey. Plus, the layout of the standard rooms is very annoying. Probably wouldn't stay here again. Jumeirah is opening a new hotel near Xin Tian Di later this year - plan to try it out next time. "
hyatt on the bund ,"what's happened to the service I stayed at this hotel as my friend was having his birthday party there on the Saturday night so it made sense. Check in was very slow as they only had us checking in for 1 night rather than 2 but as the hotel was empty it wasn't too much of a problem.Went for brunch to Aroma, smell of smoking quite strong but guess this is China. Surprised that on a Saturday they close the buffet at 2.30pm and by 2pm they were already running the food down with just scraps left at each station. Service quite heavy handed, insisted on filling water glasses to the top in order to empty the 88RMB bottles of water more quickly.Gym - booked a massage only to get to the Spa and find out they'd cancelled it. Asked me to wait for 15minutes. Had to go back to the desk after 20mins and then they put me in the massage room. Nowhere to sit while I waiting for the therapist. After 10mins, which felt like an hour, went back to the desk. Massage finally got underway 40minutes after it was due to start. Therapist was very good though.Found it quite odd that the locker room boys watched me getting dressed and undressed. I'm European so don't have hang ups about nudity but this seemed a little odd. The place was dead so perhaps they had nothing else to do but would have preferred to have them refolding towels or something.Bar - asked for a whiskey sour, barman didn't know how to make this but I explained and he did a very good job. Second one was spot on too. When I ordered the 3rd he told me to 'come back later'. ??? I waitied and eventually he made the drink. 4th was even better, he flatly refused to make the drink saying he had already made me three and that I was to drink something else instead. I called the bar manager over and she convinced him to make the drink. Didn't bother with another one!Previous reviews have commented on the great service. I'm wondering whether the Grand Hyatt sent over some of its staff when the hotel first opened because there is no-one there now who has any idea of service. For example we came down from our lift and were waiting in the lobby for a friend when someone rushed out from the check in desk, raced over to us and asked us if she could help us. I think she was trying to be helpful but just made us feel like intruders.All in all I wouldn't stay here again even at the special rate of 880RMB "
hyatt on the bund ,"Hyatt did it again...on the Bund! It is located at the north end of the Bund on a quiet street facing the Pu River; if you book a room with the River view, you have the terrific view of both sides of the Bund. However; you can hardly walk to anywhere, even the heart of the Bund is a fairly long walk. Sometimes Taxi is hard to come by because its location is a bit &quot;off&quot;. The Hotel is brand new, very modern and tastefully decorated. The grand lobby is true to Hyatt, and the service all around is superb! the room is average size, simple but elegant with modern amenities. I thought the variety of complimentary premium loose tea leaves in jars lining the bar is a nice touch, in-room coffee maker is always a plus for me. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom has separate tub and shower. The breakfast buffet is excellent, both Chinese and Western selections as well as local Shanghai specialties. It is a bit pricy, but comparable to hotels of the same class. Many are freshly made on the spot. The Tea Garden in the lobby level is a great place for meeting, a couple of tea will set you back US$25. Although the Grand Hyatt Jin Mao across the river drawfs this one in height, this new property certainly holds its own and lives up to the reputation of a Hyatt. I will choose to stay in Puxi any day...but I might like the location and the rooms of Le Royal Meridien a bit better. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Nice views but poor bathroom Am writing this review while sitting in the hotel room. I wanted to try out this new hotel since some of my friends had stayed here and gave good reports.The hotel is in the so-called North Bund area, just a couple minutes north of the picturesque Bund. Huangpu Road isn't known to all the taxi drivers, so it's useful to mention Dong Daming Road or ask the driver to go to the Bund. You'll quickly see the twin towers with the Hyatt logo on one and the Shimao logo on the other.We had a room on the 10th floor in the West Tower, and had a partial view of the Bund blocked by the Huangpu Hotel in front and the large neon signboard on top of it. I think staying in the higher zone (20th or above) should definitely fix this. Our bed faced the window and hence we could see the river from our bed.Overall the room was new and nice, with an LCD TV that swiveled so you can watch from the bed, desk or the chaise lounge. Electric blinds are operated via buttons by the bed to let in or black out light.My big complaint is with the bathroom. First, the closet is set inside the bathroom, which means you drag your luggage into the bathroom to unpack. While it's nice to be able to dress yourselves without stepping out of the bathroom, I don't like the idea of steam getting onto my woolen clothes (suit, overcoat, sweaters...). Would much prefer the way Grand Hyatt Shanghai did it - putting the closet between the bed and the bathroom, with doors on both sides so you can access it from the bathroom or from the bed area.The other big gripe with the bathroom is the sink. It's rectangular, shallow, and simply doesn't drain well because of the design. You are then faced with dirty water sitting in the sink. And the water - I have never tasted more foul-tasting water coming out of the bathroom faucet at a 5-star hotel anywhere. I am tempted to use the bottled water from the hotel to brush my teeth...Didn't dine in the hotel, but I did go to the Vue Bar at the top of the hotel. Very nice view of both the Bund and the Pudong riverside. Be aware that the lights are turned off on the Bund and the Pudong side around 10:30pm, so get there early for the full experience. Curiously there is a set of stairs leading up to higher level above the bar (which is already above 2 floors of dining space), where there is an open-air jacuzzi surrounded by some cabanas. I was tempted to use it, but had trouble figuring out how I would get to it in my bathrobe without going through the full length of the bar. Maybe I'd simply climb up the fire exit stairs? "
hyatt on the bund ,"A new Hyatt with spirit We stayed at Hyatt on the Bund for five nights in November including the official opening night - the &quot;soft start&quot; period is over and they opened more facilities including the level 32 bar (with great night views), with the Vue restaurant (Level 30) and private dining (Level 31) to follow.The hotel is in two towers, East and West, joined by a central atrium. Technically still in the Bund area, it is to the South of the traditional riverbank Bund, in an area undergoing redevelopment. We found it a pleasant 5 to 10 minute walk to the Southern end of the traditional Bund. It is not near Shanghai's (rather limited and crowded) Metro, and it is still becoming known to the city's 40,000 taxis (and 100,000 taxi drivers).Hyatt builds great staff teams in its hotels and this is no exception. Nothing we asked for was too much - room cleaning, restaurant service, front of house, bell staff were all excellent.Our room, one of the standard rooms (called &quot;deLuxe&quot;) was of a good size, comfortable, and a pleasant view across some lower old buildings to the river and Pudong. The ever-changing river, with its lighted tourist boats, coal and transport barges, small naval ships, and occasional small cruise ship was its own entertainment.There is a vast breakfast in the main cafe, which also has a multi-station, multi-national buffet lunch and dinner, and a la carte options as well. We could not fault any of the food we ate over six breakfasts, three lunches, and four dinners.The room design is unusual, with a sliding panel wall between bathroom and bedroom. When pulled back this does provide a larger space, but it does have its oddities - when in place as a wall you can't access the minibar etc which is in the back of the bathroom basin stand. Some dark marks on the bathroom floor initially looked like poor cleaning but proved to be joint sealant which had spread and darkened in the stone. The architect has so cunningly hidden the broadband and power sockets for the desk (s)he must have hated them - they are under a fold-up panel on the wall just above the desk. I hope that saves you the 20 minutes it took me to find them.We took the hotel car to and from the airport - its about an hour each way and costs about $US70. Given that the much-vaunted Maglev train (which we took anyway while there and it is fantastic) has its town station quite some distance away on the other side of the river, we found the car option more convenient.If you have come with commitments on the Pudong side of the river (as we had), it is a long taxi ride (and at peak times a slow one) to get there. We would have done better in our case to have stayed on that side, but we loved our stay at this Hyatt and at the right price (we had an opening special) we will be back. "
hyatt on the bund ,"High Style in Shanghai Hyatt on the Bund, ShanghaiNew hotel, 1 year old, just getting into full swing. Impeccable service, always someone to help or direct. Rooms exquisitely designed in chocolate, grey and wasabi color scheme, large bathroom with separate shower and tub, window to room that can be closed for privacy. Flat screen TV, broadband connection, iPod connection so you can play your own music in your room (though I had to have it replaced with one that worked). My only complaint is that the chaise lounge was too deep at one end to be comfortable for two, and the lobby couches are built for giants. Our room was a king, 17th floor, and had a good but partial view of the Bund and Pudong (if we squeezed to the extreme right it was a full view).Glass-enclosed and mirrored elevators give a view of the old Chinese neighborhood nearby, which is fun to wander through.Hotel uniforms black/wasabi accents; chinese styling in a minimalist manner. Different style for each position but all tying together: suits for desk personnel, long chiffon pants and tops for cocktail wait staff.Largest, most varied buffet breakfast I’ve encountered, and of excellent quality. Chinese, western, Japanese, Shanghai cuisines. Flavorful whole grain breads and baguettes, European cheeses of top quality including a mountain Toma from Italy. Eggs omelettes, waffles and pancakes made to order. Noodles and dumplings in broth. Fresh-brewed coffee made by the cup, and fresh-squeezed juices including carrot and mango.Health club, free, is spacious. Top of the line machines, smooth and easy to operate, at least two of each. Free weights. Glassed-in yoga and stretching room with mats, exercise balls and ballet barre. Attendant presents you with a towel and bottled water when you enter. Adjacent large pool and jacuzzi; full-service spa nearby (not free). A lovely garden pool comprises the center of the lower level and a juice bar overlooks the plantings.Only negative was some difficulty in getting taxis at this new, off the main road location. I expect the grapevine will take care of it eventually. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Gold Passport Members Beware Date of Stay: November 1 - 4,2007Room Type: River View King RoomUpgrade: noneAmount Paid Per Night: RMB2180.00++ ($292.00) Had to reserve two times because the original room rate was much higher it was only when I checked again that I found out that there was a much lower rate.Reservation Method: Gold Passport WebsiteLoyalty Card: Gold Passport MemberAirport/Hotel Transfer: Had a hard time confirming the transfer. The hotel still doesn’t have an e-Concierge system where you can book and confirm stuff before you arrive. So I had to email them at the address given in their website. 5 days passed I was still not able to get an email confirming my transfer so I had to email the Customer Service staff of Gold Passport to fix it for me. They were able to confirm everything that very same day.Didn’t see any hotel representative at the gate, which was okay since it was just a domestic flight. We finally saw him waiting at the exit for us. We walked to the parking building where the Audi A6L was waiting for us. The ride to the hotel was okay, quite long and a bit traffic because we had to go through Pudong then take the tunnel to Puxi, instead of taking the bridge, which I often pass when coming from the airport. Well we eventually got to the hotel safe so no problems there. Location: Quite disappointed at the location. I guess I was so caught up with the photos submitted here that I forgot to actually check which end of the Bund it will be located. When we arrived I found out that we are not actually ON the Bund but a bit father off to the end. You still have to cross a bridge and turn right then drive a few blocks before reaching it. Since it’s new many cab drivers don’t where it is, even a lot of locals don’t know where it is either. So you might have to do some coaching and make sure to bring those hotel cards for the taxi because the map printed on it would really come in handy.Check-in: Quick check-in, though a bit disappointed because I asked for a higher room floor and they told me that the higher rooms were all booked and they could only put me in on the 12th floor. They had a little problem with their system so they had to borrow my passport when I got up in the room.Room: Room was nice, unfortunately I paid for a River View Room but only got a view of the hotel’s other tower. I would have to stand by the window and peer to my right to actually see the river and Pudong. The open bathroom is big, though the closet was a bit tight especially when carrying thick jackets, they have a good counter for your bags at the end. Walls can be drawn if you want some privacy or when you have company, the shower stall and toilet stalls are frosted so you won’t feel very exposed. The counter for the faucet is a bit tight with just enough room for toiletries. Bed: The bed was great after staying at the hard beds of Hotel Kapok in Beijing it was a welcome change. Though the pillows are wrapped in a different fabric that could be a bit rough, it was actually good.Breakfast: Breakfast spread was huge. Everything you want is there, though it doesn’t seem to change. There is a Chinese section, then continental and Japanese, they also have a pancake and waffle station beside the bread counters and fruits are always nice and fresh. I suggest you get a room package with breakfast because if you have to pay it separately it’s about 300RMB per breakfast.Check-out: Check out was quick, though when I reserved my room I remember selecting the Bund Club Promo Package which includes complimentary broadband connection. Problem is, they seem to have forgotten all about it and kept on insisting that I pay for mine. Since I was in a hurry to catch my flight I just paid it because it was just a little under 400RMB for the 3 days.Overall Evaluation: Extremely disappointed with my stay. I reserved through Gold Passport and requested that I be placed in a high room but was told upon checking in that the floors were booked. However my friends got upgraded because their keys won’t work on the floor they were originally at and they got upgraded to a River View King Room on the 26th floor while I was stuck on the 12th. And they told me it was booked? Then to make matters worse, they got a better view to think I was paying almost 300RMB more a night. I decided to complain the following morning to the General Manager and got a note from the Director of Rooms that evening together with a bottle of wine (a 10 dollar bottle of wine). I really felt offended that they would assume that I do not know what happened to my friend’s case and explained that it was a gesture of service recovery that they upgraded their rooms. And simply promised to do update my preference for future stays. That night I sent her an email explaining that I am aware of what happened and am glad that they extended that courtesy to my friends seeing that I was the one who convinced them of actually staying there (from Eton in Pudong). But I also told her that I do not understand why the Front Desk Staff would lie to my face that the floors were booked? Plus from the very first day I already informed the Front Desk Staff that I wish to be moved and they promised to move me as soon as one is available. But never got any word from them and what really upset me was that I would meet some people on the elevators getting checked in to better floors and better views. So what happened to my request?The Director of Rooms sent me a note the following morning apologizing and asking if there was a way for them to make it up to me. But it’s already my last day and since we were meeting friends and catching on last minute shopping I really don’t want to stay any longer at the hotel and move my stuff, besides all I’m going to do when I get back to the hotel at night is pack and sleep. It’s just a case of too late the hero. This whole experience really made me think twice why I keep on choosing Hyatt over other brands. This was the first time I ever experience such bad and unprofessional service coming from a 5 Star Hotel, I mean I think even motels could do better. And to think I was already a loyal Gold Passport member. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Coolest hotel I've stayed in What a hotel! Only open a couple of months (and there are signs that it's in the soft launch phase) so everything is brand new. My bedroom, a double on the upper 20s, was without doubt the coolest hotel room I have ever stayed in. Minimalist design in shades of brown. Floor to ceiling windows with electric blinds. A bathroom without walls, well not quite but the washbasin gives the appearance of being in the middle of the room. Pillows and shower, two particularly important aspects for me were excellent: you have a choice between a wall-mounted shower head or a rainforest style ceiling one. The views are superb. My only gripe, and a small one at that, is that there are so many switches it's hard to know what does what. Service could not have been better, but was not grovelling. The lounge bar is cool - cream and sand coloured. The food in the restaurant was excellent, both at breakfast and lunch; the choice is magnificent. The lobby is a glassed in area between 2 towers and reminded me a bit of some convention centres I've been to. But it did add to the awe of the place. On the downside, the hard launch isn't until November, so I was woken by drilling in the room above me at 7.15, and during the conference I attended (facilities and staff again first class) we had to put up with hammering above us. Location is, for the moment, an issue. Getting a taxi from the hotel is very hard. I had to walk to a nearby junction to hail a cab to the airport. The hotel is on a part of street which appears to be a dead end, and there is another hotel before it so taxis don't really have any cause to go past the hotel. And the staff didn't make much of an effort to get taxis, other than standing in the street and hoping one would come by. Also, &quot;on the Bund&quot; in the hotel's title might lead you to believe that you step out of the hotel onto the famous Bund with the Yangtse flowing past you. No. The hotel is to the north of the Bund. There are nondescript warehouses between the hotel and the water. No doubt these will be gentrified or knocked down in due course, but it isn't a great location at present. I'm going back to Shanghai in December for a long weekend and much as I like the hotel I won't be staying here, purely because of the location. There are far nicer options for a leasure stay. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Best view in the entire Shanghai If city shyline view is your fancy, then this is hotel is a &quot;can't miss&quot;. It simply has the best view of Shanghai - a panoramic view of Pu-Dong (East SH) and Pu-Xi (West SH). It is located in the Huang-Pu district, 3 blocks away from the north end of the Bund. Until my recent stay here, I always thought the Grand Hyatt in Pu-Dong has the best view, but this new hotel absolutely has claimed the Top spot. For a hotel with a city skline view on a water front, I would rate this as one of the top three in Asia, on par with Intercontinental in HongKong, and Ritz-Calton in Singapore. Besides the magnifant view and contemporary decor through out, this hotel clearly is well managed to top international standard. Everywhere you go, you are always greeted with a smile and good morning/afternoon/evening from EVERY staff you run into. Staffs are eager to help. If there is one negative I can point to, it is the fact that this hotel is so new and none of the taxi drivers I hired know of this hotel. Even the road (Huang-Pu) is not exactly well known, especially to the less experienced drivers. I have to give them directions (&quot;north side of the bund, across the &quot;bai-du&quot; bridge and turn right at the first road, etc.) Hopefully over time this will become a non-issue. "
hyatt on the bund ,"Wow! We extended our stay to four nights because of 1. the view, 2. the room, 3. the food, 4. the service, and 5. the location.1. The View. Absolutely the best view from a hotel room in Shanghai. Take a look at the two panorama shots (one daytime the other nighttime) I took from our Bund River Suite on the 23rd floor. The pictures say it all.2. The Room. The Bund River Suite is well worth the price: four panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows (two in the desk/sitting area, one in the bedroom, and one in the shower/bath room) forming a semi-circle at the end of the floor. The bathroom is as big as the standard-sized room in the hotel. (pictures attached)3. The Food. For a hotel that's been open less than two months, they have their act together. Breakfast and dinner in the buffet are the best I've had in China. Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in the Tea Room listening to wonderful jazz singing and piano playing...very relaxing.4. The Service. Highly attentive and friendly service everywhere. The staff seems proud of the hotel and their service. An outstanding job of training has been done here.5. The Location. Located on the North Bund, just two blocks away from the main Bund, Hyatt on the Bund is the closest 5-star hotel to that famous stretch of Shanghai real estate. If you're mostly interested in shopping, the hotel is not set amid high-end shops or non-stop hawkers. If you're interested in experiencing the contrasts of historical and modern Shanghai, this is the best hotel in town. (Many visitors to Shanghai complain that &quot;old Shanghai&quot; has disappeared as their hotels are surrounded by glitzy signs and sky scrapers.) On one side of Hyatt on the Bund lies an historic area full of housing unique to Shanghai, a combination of British row houses and Chinese courtyard living reflecting the international history of the city. And, the Chinese are still living there! A walk around these neighbor hoods gives one a wonderful sense of history. Just three blocks away from the hotel is an area just off the Bund set for major gentrification...preserving historical buildings and putting up new. You can observe this work in progress with an easy walk. There's lots to see. (one picture attached taken from north side of hotel, 23rd floor.)The best hotel experience in China! "

intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Great room Great service Great City My wife and I stayed here for a week in May 09. I used priority club points and received a nice suite upgrade due to my status. The room was very large, modern, clean and comfortable with lounge area, large desk and very soft bed. We were welcomed with fresh fruit and bottled water was supplied for us a couple of times a day. A bit noisy with the windows open, but high up and nice view of Pudong. The bathroom was also very nice. Large, clean, nice amenities. I highly recommend the club intercontinental upgrade that gives you access to the lounge on the top floor. There is a very nice breakfast buffet and menu. It's not extensive, but refined, fresh and more than adequate. There are always drinks and snacks to be had there after shopping, sightseeing etc. It's very reserved and businesslike, but we felt comfortable even though we were dressed casually for sightseeing/shopping.The service is very good and the staff is very well-trained. A bit formal, but if it does make you uncomfortable, it's nice. Everyone smiles and asks if you need anything.Front desk, door staff, concierge were all incredibly friendly and accomodating. If you ask for directions, advice, tips on how to get somewhere, you are almost overwhelmed with friendly response, but it was all welcome and comfortable. We were in search of the best dumplings and shopping and we got all kinds of interesting suggetions and help.We ate one night in the noodle restaurant and it was very good. Don't miss the tourist tunnel under the river!!! "

They have a really nice bar there also that was great to have a few drinks at and i also had a spa treatment that was relaxing and had a great ambiance. The location was perfect as it was close to some great shops and easy to get to major city centers. I Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay with great rates and value for money. "

From the moment you arrive, you are greeted with a smile from the friendly doorman and bell staff and throughout our stay the hotel staff were always available to assist and provide friendly, efficient service. We hadn't researched the city before we arrived so the Concierge staff were invaluable in recommending great shopping spots, restaurants and things to see and do. We stayed in a Premier Suite which was stylish, spacious, well appointed and had the most comfortable bed i have ever experienced in a hotel. The room also included an iPod docking station which was an added bonus. We enjoyed Club Lounge access which was superb and included hot made to order breakfast and complimentary evening drinks and canapes which featured superb wines and Moet on the menu.I can't wait to go back to Shanghai, it is vibrant city and i would definitely be staying again at the InterContinental Shanghai Pudong.

A good choice in Pudong. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Nice hotel for the price So this hotel is located in the Pudong district which is on the other side of the river from the main downtown area. It is close walking distance to the subways to get over to the main district. There are also attractions on this side such as the Oriental Pearl TV Tower......awesome. As for the hotel, the rooms were very nice and quiet. Pillows were very nice too. The restaurants were OK although a bit pricey which I guess is to be expected for a 5 star hotel. Anyways, I would stay here again and enjoyed the stay. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"OK but... Well, the facade is nice, the location spot on. (although you will still need a taxi everywhere). The staff are extremely helpful, and the decor is attractive. The bar is comforting, with pool table, and one night, they had a covers band playing to a very high standard. Be warned, the prices are expensive!The food was amazing - I went back for more each time.The rooms however, are a disappointment. The plug on my bath came out, and the workmanship of the bath left a lot to be desired.Having said that, the hotel overall was outstanding. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Business hotel on a luxury side. We chose this hotel to be in a more quiet Pudong area in our last two days in Shanghai. It was additional US$100 a night to upgrade to the club level, but definitely well worth it. The club level upgrade included a renovated room, an afternoon tea (the desserts there are to die for!), free drinks on the club level for happy hour and buffet breakfast. That was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had in my life! The renovated rooms are very nice with good entertainment system, spacious bathroom and big windows. We really enjoyed the room!The concierge guy was very helpful. He got us tickets to Era circus and also provided us with all maps and directions to various locations.The rest of the staff was very cold. Since this is a business hotel (and you will feel a bit out of place as a tourist there), they have more reserved way of communicating. Not friendly at all.There is really not too much to do around the hotel. However, the subway is close by. We found a good restaurant in a mall across the road (not sure what’s the name of the mall, but it has all major brand names such as H&amp;M etc) The restaurant is on the third floor – you have to take the elevator – and is called South Memory (very trendy and the food is very good and reasonably priced). "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"love your new rooms this is my second visit to this hotel and wow the new rooms are amazing. I paid the same rate as last year but for a better room! Club lounge service is very personalized, especially the butler service when you stay in the cliub lounge room. Silar the club lounge butler helped me whenever I needed him. The food in the Club lounge is also a very high quality and they dont go tight on the food and drinks like other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. I will come back, new rooms are large, clean and love the plasmas. Only thing they need to work on, and I told them, is working better with the local drivers to increase their understanding of English. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Good choice Hotel is good, american style top 4 star..not a 5 star but close. gym is good enough with lots of treadmills. lots of shopping and eating all around the hotel. but remember the hotel is in pudong which is the newer business part of shanghai so you need to take a cab across the river to get to the more touristy older parts like the French Concession (great pedestrian area with excellent restauarants). That being said, cabs in China are dirt cheap (go for the green, white or yellow coloured cabs, stay away from red ones and other ones as much more expensive...ie $10 instead of $6 sorta amount). The breakfast buffet here is the best I've ever had....way better than anyone I've been to in Vegas. Fantastic...love dumplings in the morning. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,Consistant hospitality This was the third time I stayed at this hotel. Right from the reception to concieage it was very pleasant experience. Hotel is conveniently located and the suite I stayed was qute good. Being Indian I only used their resturent for breakfast and the near by &quot;India Kitchen&quot; for other meals. 
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Shop Around - Probably Better Values in this Area I have been traveling to China twice a year for the last 5 years, and have stayed in many different hotels in the Shanghai area. This was my first time at this particular property, and absolutely plan to shop around before staying here again. The hotel lobby was nice, but had a strong/stale cigarette odor. While checking in, the front desk seemed more interested in up-selling rooms and services, than making me feel welcome. Finally after not understanding all the option, I ask simply for the lowest cost option available. My room was on the 20th floor and was really small and the décor dated. The carpets were stained, and the bathroom was only equipped with the basic essentials. The cab from the airport took about 45 minutes and cost 140 Yuan, without traffic. With traffic, I’ve heard the time can double. I had to try for over 20 minutes to place an order for room service (either they were understaffed, or just really busy when I called). Overall, not my best hotel experience in China. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,Excellent hotel friendly staff great beds and food I recently stayed at this hotel and was very pleased We had a lovely room and the breakfasts and buffet dinners were the best we experienced in four cities in China Overall we had a great holiday to a fascinating country 
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"A great place to stay.. First class service, great rooms, fantastic food and very friendly staff. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Very good option in Shangai I stayed in Intercontinental Pudong more than 10 times already. It is not the prettiest or newest hotel in Shanghai but very convenient. The staff is professional, the location is good, rooms are sufficient, Room-Service and Breakfast Buffet is very good. Great business hotel. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"WOW My re-visit was perfect. This is my umpteenth stay at the IC in Pudong, and this time they got it perfect. My last visit was over 9 months ago, and have things ever changed.My unpronouncable last (family) name was said correctly the first time at check in. My upgrade was configured the way I liked it with twin beds in a normally king-size-bed room. The assistant manager came out to greet me, as he remembered me from my critical comments to him last time. And on and on and on. I have reviewed this hotel going back three years, and I have had plenty of near-miss stays before. The carpets and TVs are new, and I was told they are still going to renovate this room once more very shortly. It was fine as is, but the modern design of the new club rooms will go throughout the hotel, see another reviews on those. The front desk was cordial every time, every workshift.. Shanghai's finest breakfast buffet retained the honor easily with the copious variety of western, Chinese, Japanese and just plain fabulous international dishes. I especially like the freshly pressed watermelon juice mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice. You get the idea. The room features what appear at first to be soft beds, but then again they provided the right amount of support. The furnishings, amenities and little things were all there. The place was spotless, including the new carpeting. No hint of smoking, either, another great bonus for a Chinese hotel.The only area for improvement is a common one in 99% of hotels. The reading lights next to the bed are a bit dim. I actually brought my own 20-watt, 220-volt flourescent bulb, so I did not have to ask for higher wattage. (This was a longer China stay at several hotels, so my $5 investment pays off.) And a word about the taxis who are stationed there. They are of the highest quality. But do not be confused with those who drive up to let off passengers and then pick up hotel guests. You might not get the same honest quality drivers you get from the taxi stand at the hotel. So ask the doorman for one of the hotel's taxis, not a drive-up, drop-off one. They cost the same as all taxis, by the meter.No doubt about it this time. The IC team made the effort and it shows. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Great Hotel Great hotel. Nice new renovated room. breakfast, staff "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"the first also the last time we will visit this property- 1 start rating at most My husband and I booked the hotel via intercontinental.com online @ the last minutes, just 24 hours before the trip - being the ambassador member of the hotel chain- and esp after a fabulous stay at intercontinental Beijing (finance street) - it should be safe to stay with the same hotel chain. The experience turned out to be disastrous - we arrived at nearly mid-night due to 3 hours flight delay - needless to say a warm welcome from staff - the front desk was rude, and ignorant - as if they only wish we go away as soon as possible - needless to mention any start hotel staff should bear, the basis coourtesy and knowledge. The hotel hallway was ingeneral hot (due to renovation somehow, with bad smell and poor ventilation - the whole facility was poorly maintened. Needless mentioning of the room, it smells stale and dusty. worst than a one star hotel. Next morning we tried the complimentary breafast-as it's included in the package, the onlything we noticed, was poorly managed staff and facilaty - with all the disappointments, we decided to check out a day ealier - and moved to much cleaner and friendlier St Regis Shanghai with 24hr butler service to each room- we were at last satisfied, at ease with our choice. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Intercontinental Old Elegance I've stayed at the Intercontinental Shanghai Pudong many times. This was the first time I have stayed there in a few years, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But it is the same ol' Intercontinental.The check-in was swift and efficient. We upgraded to Club Rooms for a little more in price. this gave us free internet access (normally US$30 per day) and free breakfast and happy hour snacks and drinks on the top floor.The rooms were nice--not overwhelming, but spacious and comfortable. The large desk was welcome and the bathroom was spacious, as always. It was a little difficult to get the room to the correct temperature, though. It was either too hot or too cold. That is a common occurrence and I didn't find it overly annoying. The people were always gracious and willing to help out. I remembered to tip the housekeeping staff every day. They really do an excellent job. Outside of the hotel on the final day, I ran into Ken, a former doorman at the Hotel. He remembered me from years ago and inquired about my co-workers with a memory that astounded me. He now works in kitchen sales at the Intercontinental, but still took time to greet me as if I was the most treasured guest. Breakfast upstairs is great. You have a small buffet and a set menu you cna order from. I enjoyed the fresh grapefruit juice every morning. One morning, they didn't have grapefruit juice, but I was told when I arrived that they were busy squeezing me a glass in the kitchen because they knew how much I enjoyed it. The buffet in the regular dining room is wonderful. We ate there for dinner twice and found it to be everythign you could wish for in a meal. The people are gracious and please note that the servers will let you keep the table as long as you want without bringing you a bill. They will bring it when asked, but they don't want to rush you.On my last evening at the Hotel, I received a 300RMB coupon for the spa. Ah-ha! They didn't realize I had a late flight the next day, so I used it for 300RMB off of a 350RMB foot massage. Great spa. Very calming. They also had a special for the Club rooms where you could buy one treatment and get a second 1/2 off. I didn't know about this until I entered the spa, though, so I didn't take advantage of it. I usually get my Chinese massages at blindman massage--cheaper ($21 for 3 hours) and more therapeutic (less like a spa, more like a health clinic). But the I-Spa is very nice for a spa experience in Shanghai. All in all, my stay at the Intercontinental was wonderful. I'd go again. And again. And again.... "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"great place to stay across the river from the bund we stayed here for business for almost two weeks. should have spent the extra to upgrade. the room was very nice (other then draft from stairwell door they kept leaving open that was right next to our door- made the room rather chilly). the resturant had everything you would have wanted - the pastry counter did leave something to be desired, we americans do like our sugar :)great staffnew spa "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Losing its top rating Have stayed here about three times a year since it opened. This most recent stay was a disappointment. The hotel lost power three nights in a row in the middle of the night. Coming from the US, you are awake in the middle of the night so quickly looked outside to see if it was just the hotel or more. It was just the hotel. On the third night, there was a letter on the night table to say that power would be off for half an hour. Supposedly there is a back up generator but it didn't kick in so the halls, everything was very dark. The breakfast buffet is still great but we had to ask for our coffee more than once and waiters seem to care less than in the past. Maybe it is a training issue due to turnover from people going to better hotels. Other food order for dinner was good as well but service was less than in the past. Also, there was mildew in the tile in the shower that has started to smell bad. These are things that can be fixed but need attention quickly. We are considering other options for future stays. The location is great for tunnel access to the Puxi side but the issues need to get addressed. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Pretty Good Hotel I've visited the hotel several times, mostly for the wonderful buffet dinner at the hotel...It is amazing, perhaps the only good food I find in China in my 3 trips there annually. Finally found a decent rate there (It was about RMB1000/night versus the usual RMB1500 that I usually see). The room was clean, bathroom was spacious...But the decor seemed a little dated. I paid an extra RMB400/night for the club level which got breakfast, afternoon tea (which I never did partake in), and evening cocktails with hot appetizers--which became my dinner nightly--the food was more than sufficient for a meal. The service at the hotel is top-notch, friendly from the bellhops to the maids, and the Club Level attendants are not stingy with the drinks...Good selection of booze, beer and wine. Definitely worth RMB1400 a night for my all-meal option, but wouldn't have paid more. I will stay here again. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Beg to differ I'm not sure why but my experience differed greatly from those below.I certainly didn't get the English speaking taxi service and on 3 different occaisions had to call the hotel whilst driving around Shanghai in circles to get the receptionist to explain to the driver and as for the concierge calling us by name, mmmm, not me. I actually found the staff quite sullen and this Hotel could learn a few things from its smaller sister in Beijing, The Holiday Inn Central, a brilliant Hotel where I was treated like a princess and felt as though I had come home. The Buffet was great and thier new Guest Relations manager was too, he , in my opinion, has a job on his hands. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"No Complaints in Pudong Stayed for seven days. We upgraded to the club level to have access to meeting rooms and free breakfast and happy hour (only 200 RMB upcharge per night). Being a group of six with reports to write every night -- we enjoyed the happy hour and tasty treats (on two nights, this constituted dinner), supported by a wireless connection. Room was nice sized, bath was too. It was quiet and bed was comfortable.Breakfast on the club level required sharp sight. The various offerings were often in nice glassware on the shelves -- my blurry eyes missed much of it on day 1. You can order a hot breakfast (again, I missed this on day 1 -- I joined a colleague on day 2 and out came a fresh waffle!). Happy hour (5:30 to 8:00) included some very nice offerings and they kept bringing out new treats. The restaurant lunch was good, a bit pricy. Dinner had the choice of a nice buffet (good value) or an ala carte menu. No one was dissatisfied with their meals -- no one really raved about them either. (Dinner one night, lunch twice.)The iBar in the lobby had a live band. There was a regular group of three women who went to tables where men were sitting alone or in small groups .... Our table was never approached, but that could be because I was there (female). "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Excellent Concierge Stayed on the Club floor and was upgraded to a suite which was enormous. The Concierge Desk at this hotel is very well organised, and friendly.I would stay here again. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"The best Banana Bread in the world! This may be a strange review but I must mention the fact that this hotel has the most amazing Banana Bread I have ever tasted. It can be purchased from their restaurant on the ground level. You must try it even if you don't stay at the hotel. Trust me, it's so good. "
intercontinental shanghai pudong ,"Great hotel but shows its age Stayed here 3 times during the past year, once for two weeks. Good points: beautiful lobby and atrium with glass elevators, live classical music, and an air of elegance. Highly competent, professional staff are friendly, helpful, and work hard to make your stay memorable. Spectacular breakfast buffet has almost every item imaginable, all of uniformly excellent quality. I haven't seen a more impressive spread in all my extensive travels through Asia. Well-equipped gym and pool are open 24 hours (great for jet lag, when you wake up at 3:00 A.M. and can't get back to sleep). Great location, just 5 minutes from the subway and huge department store. Weak points: Rooms are spacious but fixtures and furnishings are tired and need replacement. Stayed twice in an executive suite, which was huge. Regular rooms are very average, with aging bath fixtures and worn carpet - definitely not up to 5 star standards. "

ivy hotel shanghai ,"Nice hotel Ivy boutique hotel is lovely. Only problem we had was finding it after we got off the metro at jin'ang temple station. The hotel map made it look not so far away - however this map is not to scale!! Also others had said it was about 15min walk from the station...This is NOT true lol. The road the hotel is on is actually VERY long - as are the majority of roads in Shanghai! But after some disorientation in the rain and being very tired dragging luggage through the streets negotiating the traffic and other pedestrians. Took us around an hour in the end and we ended up doing a full circle! lol Didnt help that we didnt have nor could we remember the number of the building being 700-odd when we were at the 100-odd end of the road!!! Take a taxi! About 11Yuan within the area anyway. But anyhoo, hotel itself is quite nice. Passageways have quotes from films to add to the designer feel. A sitting area on our floor with clouds floating above and ornamental decor again added to this. The Ivy shows a movie each night on their big screen in the longe area - turned out to be the same move every night - Gone with the Wind - with no sound! Decor continues with the room theme...Rooms are nice, with coloured see-through screen separating the bedroom and bathroom! Little touches like the toiletries bag with many bits and pieces and the artwork on the wall. LAN connection for those who have laptops and wi-fin in the lobby area. Breakfast was a choice from chinese and american - some congee on the former and eggs and bacon from the latter. Coffee was goood! Staff very helpful and pleasant. Overall lovely hotel. Location could've been a little closer to the metro station but with taxi's being cheap its not that much of an issue. Just remember to carry the hotel card /address with you! Ivy could print a larger version to help the poor taxi drivers trying to read it in the dark! "
ivy hotel shanghai ,"The Ivy Hotel - design gem in local Jing´an district Since we hadn´t found any trustful reviews on `The Ivy Hotel` - a 46 room boutique hotel for business and leisure travellers in Shanghai´s upcoming Jing´an district - before our trip we were attracted by the hotel´s website and the appealing pictures of the rooms hidden behind an ivy-painted outside. Furthermore, we got a really got offer on a booking request on hrs - stay 5 nights/pay 4 nights/breakfast included - so we finally decided on The Ivy.To my surprise early check-in on the arrival day at around 9:30 a.m. after a 10 hours uncomfortable economy flight was not a big thing for the friendly English-speaking staff at the stylish reception below a huge chandelier. The premises were modern and, most important, clean, calm, comfy, and air-conditioned (outside in those early morning hours --&gt; temp. 32 degrees Celsius, wow). Furthermore, bathing and beauty goodies, slippers, safety box, mini bar, bottled water for free awaited us in our tasteful furnished platinum/premier room (twin beds, flat screen, marble bathroom w/ bathtub and a separate shower). Besides, The Ivy offers free parking, ironing service and further services like personal butler upon request.The breakfast was a bit ´basic` - offering a chinese style breakfast (fried noodles, wan tan soup, etc.) or american style breakfast (toast, jam, oatmeal, muesli/cereals, omelette, or eggs in any type) w/ tea or coffee/orange juice. Nevertheless, it was ok being included in our booking (separate price: 60rmb). Unfortunately, we didn´t have time to have dinner in the restaurant but it seemed to attracted both, locals and tourists. As far as I remember, a three-course meal was offered for 158 rmb.The staff was absolutely helpful and friendly when dealing with our requests, for e.g., researching train departures, opening hours, taxi, etc.The Ivy´s location is approx. a 10 min. walk from Jing´an temple and the metro station (line 2). A metro station at the next junction (Jiazhou Rd./Changping Rd.) is under construction (finshed by 2010/2012?!) All in all, The Ivy an be a great deal and a very, very comfy ´base camp´ with cordial staff for your visit to Shanghai!!! "
jianguo hotel ,"Was treated like dirt when we complained about being stolen My family and I stayed at the Jianguo Hotel in Shanghai. On June 15, 2009 my sister noticed her makeup kit was missing, My nephew noticed that his eye contact solution was also missing. 8 of my fish cloisonne were also missing. We did bring this up to the front desk. They did come to our room immedately. They took a statement from us and them promptly called us back an hour later to tell us that they contacted the maid and her manager and said that they did not believe she did it. I would not recommed this hotel. I also learned that if I would have called the police that they would have made the hotel reimburse us for the stolen items. "
jianguo hotel ,"Great hotel - great location This hotel is really good - in a great location, the staff were friendly and efficient. Room was good - as was the shower. Breakfast was very good, food was hot. "
jianguo hotel ,Average business hotel Stayed at the Jianguo hotel for one night before travelling to Wuhan. Overall pretty standard business hotel. Rooms were normal size and had everything that was needed. Breakfast was good with a varied selection. Hotel location is ok with easy access to the Shanghai metro to get around. Staff were helpful anf looked after our bags for a couple of hours when we checked ut early. 
jianguo hotel ,First Class Hotel... Enjoyed our stay here for two nights. The food was excellent and breakfast was superb with fantastic choice (including bottles of mineral water). Didn't have time to try the swimming pool unfortuately. The lobby toilets were immaculate however bizarrely had partial frosted glass between the cubicles and on the doors -a little off-putting to say the least!Rooms were of a good standard and very clean. Would definitely recommend this. 
jianguo hotel ,"Nice clean business hotel The Jianguo is a nice and clean 4-star (by Chinese standards) hotel. The rooms were big enough, with a comfortable king size bed, a couch and a desk. The staff was very friendly and it was never a problem getting cards written in Chinese from the concierge to let the taxi driver know where to take me. The breakfast here is also outstanding, with a mix of foods to make anyone from North America, Europe or Asia happy.The location of the hotel is just ok. It was convenient for my business meetings and is close to the football/soccer stadium. A taxi ride to the French Concession wasn't too bad, but a ride to the Bund in Shanghai traffic took a long time. "
jianguo hotel ,"Small room by good price Stayed at the Jianguo for three days on business. Hotel was well priced, but found it did not really live up to its 4 star claim. Rooms were clean and in good repair, but showed their age. Also the rooms were quite small, especially the bathroom. Room was quiet.Service was good - but like other reviewers I was followed off the elevator and propositioned for a 'massage' while I was walking to my room. Breakfast buffet was OK. Hotel location was central, and for its price I'd stay here again, just my expectations would be set lower on the 'luxury' front. "
jianguo hotel ,"Very Good Business Hotel Stayed at this hotel for a total of 9 nights while in Shanghai. The service and cleanliness was excellent. The food was above par at the morning and evening buffet. It is conveniently located to several large shopping areas, and about a 30 min cab ride to the downtown and Bund areas. If your location of business is close by you can't do better, but if you are here as a tourist you are far from the action.The beds were a bit hard, but I am comparing them to US hotels. The bathroom had a nice hot shower, and great water pressure. The high speed access made it easy to do my work.All in all a very good business hotel. "
jianguo hotel ,"Good and reasonable clean hotel I have been to a few hotels in the Shanghai area but this one was one of the better ones for location and cost!I booked it through asiarooms and the price was MUCh cheaper than booking the hotel direct.I had a room on the executive floor that gave you benefits such as free internet, a fully digital room so the tv also doubled as a HUGE computer, a separate floor for breakfast - where you could get both western and local foods, a happy hour (!)Room was clean, large and comfy with a fruit basket each day.The only negative thing I can say was the bed was quite hard but this is a Chinese 'thing'!Will defianlty stay again!! "
jianguo hotel ,"Nice hotel the prostitutes in the foyer were a worry though I won't bother going in to too much detail about the facilties, staff etc: My room was small but nice, Internet access handy and daily breakfast very nice. Concierge very helpful with writing cards in Chinese to give to taxi drivers.What did concern me, and I have no idea how it is in other hotels, was the number of requests for &quot;massages&quot; I and other members of our travelling party received. Also, one evening when we returned to the hotel there were 3 prostitutes standing by the elevators on the ground floor looking for business. (It took me a while to realise that the women standing around in some bars and on street corners in some parts of China are in fact selling themselves.... Call me niave!)It would be nice to think that, even if this does go on at every business grade hotel in China, it's something that's not condoned by management and that the &quot;procurement&quot; of such services could go on elsewhere.... "
jianguo hotel ,"Reasonably priced central Hotel Stayed in the Jianguo for a couple of nights over the weekend whilst on business. The Hotel appears to be fairly open &amp; modern in the main areas; lobby &amp; restaurants but I found my bedroom to be pretty small, old fashioned &amp; a bit claustrophobic. However, it was clean &amp; had internet access. On my first evening I ate in the Itoya Japanese restaurant. For me personally the menu was fairly restricted but I did enjoy what I ordered. On the second night I ate in the Sunflower court. I opted to order from the menu &amp; the meal was acceptable, but I wished I had gone for the buffet as the selection seemed to be really good. I didn't go for breakfast &amp; ate lunch in the food court of one of the nearby department stores, which had plenty of choice &amp; was very cheap.The location of the Hotel was very much a positive. It was quiet enough in the evenings, but only a 5/10 minute walk to the shopping district.Would recommend the Hotel for a short stay if you don't mind fairly cramped conditions in your room. The room provided decent value for money. "
jianguo hotel ,"Very clean and comfortable We stayed in this hotel as part of our Kuoni tour of China. Some structural work was being undertaken, scaffolding was being erected while we were there. We received fruit and free drinks as compensation for this but we were not inconvenienced at all. The room on the 15th floor was clean and very comfortable with all the expected facilities. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. "
jianguo hotel ,"Great Place I have stayed at this Hotel several times while in Shanghai. Rooms are very clean and well appointed. The executive floors have their own lounge on the 23rd. floor. Great view, and relaxing atmosphere. A better breakfast is served when staying on the exec. floors. There is shopping nearby, and there is a huge Catholic Cathedral directly across the street. It is approx 40 mins. to the airport. You can arrange for the hotel to pick you up at the airport. They will be waiting for you with a sign. I highly recommend this hotel. "
jianguo hotel ,"Nice place! We stayed at this hotel for 1 week. It is an international hotel, with a caring staff. The breakfast buffet is geared towards all nationalities. Rooms are spacious and clean. Rooms have a safe in them. Walking distance to shopping, bank, restaurants &amp; subway. Hotel has restaurants, hair salon/barber, business center, pool, etc. Concierge staff to arrange sightseeing or other amenities. We felt very safe in this area. I liked the fact that you could open the windows if you wish, too. "

jia shanghai ,"The details really make the difference We'd booked a studio at JIA for three nights as part of a trip round China. The hotel is a bit tricky to find, but get a good map and you'll be ok. It's right by West Nanjing Road metro station and that's how we got there from the airport, after a ride on Shanghai's superfast maglev train (recommended).From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome. Checking in took minutes and then we were shown our studio on the fifth floor.The room was compact but beautifully designed. This isn't a hotel that pays lip-service to the idea of design. From the well thought out bathroom to the multi-region plugs, entertainment system, cleverly integrated kitchenette and countless other details, you can tell that someone's spent a serious amount of time designing the room to look great and function well as a place to stay.Oh - the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom toiletries really nice. And the free broadband is really fast and reliable.We did, however, have one major problem. Shortly after we checked in, we noticed a strange, drain-like smell. I'm not sure where this was coming from; possibly from the air-con unit or the kitchenette extractor fan. We put up with it on the first night, but when it didn't get any better, complained to the front desk.They responded admirably, checking out the smell then moving us to a suite (no other studios were available). I can safely say the enormous suite was the most impressive hotel room I've every stayed in, with a huge living area and lovely stone balcony. I assume the problem itself was a one-off - and we really appreciated the excellent service to get it sorted quickly.There are lots of other nice touches at this hotel too. The complimentary afternoon tea and cake and evening drinks in the lobby are a good way to start your evening in Shanghai. And the breakfast is fantastic; we were expected a buffet but it's actually now a full waiter service breakfast cooked to a really high standard.Location? You're moments from a metro stop and there are lots of posh shops and restaurants around. For something more down to earth, hit the food street round the corner and try Yang's Dumplings in particular. They're something of a local institution, so someone will point you the way.The bad points? Well, there was no information about the hotel in either of the rooms we stayed in. I think they want you to call reception for information on everything from room service to check out time, but a bit of information to hand would've been useful.And obviously, there was the issue we had with our first room. But really, that's it for negatives. Assuming the issue we had was a one-off, I honestly don't see how you could do better with a hotel in Shanghai. "
jia shanghai ,"Wonderful hotel In a lovely 1920's building right on Nanjing Road West.Perfect front desk staff. Helpful, warm, charming service.Lobby is cute, slightly crazy on the air con (but that's China, they keep it on 18C if you are lucky). Room was great, with a very handy and beautiful carrara marble kithchenette.Perfect bathroom. Towels could be better though. Bit worn out.Decor is simple and minimal, yet warm and welcoming.Issimo Restaurant is AMAZING, some of the best italian food I have ever had. Pizza is fantastic (I'm italian and obsessed with pizza).Delivered to your room if you fancy. Room service is amazing, comes from Issimo, same menu.Breakfast is good, but could improve on service and buffet selection. Eggs are amazing though, served with grilled asparagus. Coffee is amazing (Illy).I just loved this hotel. "
jia shanghai ,"Gorgeous hotel great breakfast our room stylish but a little small Jia was a fabulous based to explore Shanghai. Stylish small hotel with excellent service and a really good feel. Our room was lovely but a little small. Other than that, only positive things. Breakfast is excellent (the rye pancakes especially). The afternoon snacks and evening drinks a real bonus. The service was fantastic. Good gym with washing machine and dryer which is very helpful. "
jia shanghai ,"A Shanghai Paradise If you're going to Shanghai then the Jia is it. Huge comfy beds, Hip Hotel decor, great staff, complimentary breakfast in the coolest of dining rooms, complimentary afternoon tea and evening wine,beer and softdrink in the bar.The location is perfect just off Nanjing road- walk to pretty much all the shopping you want.... copy markets 3 blocks away, a piazza with Starbucks, Wagam (italian food if you need a western hit), bakeries and at the end the best street food laneway. Yangs dumplings were the best..... always a queue. The traditional Shanghai soup dumplings 4 for 5 RMB. Further on giant oysters on the BBQ with garlic tomato and a touch of chilli were a steal at 5 RMB each.The Hotel was perfect in every way.Staff friendly,efficient and always incredibly helpful and I could easily have moved in forever. Thanks Jia. "
jia shanghai ,"Return stay-enjoyed the hotel more the second time! We have just returned from a trip to Vietnam and Shanghai and spent the last 6 nights of our trip in a balcony suite on the 6th floor of the Jia Shanghai. We had stayed at the hotel in June but this time returned with our family and upgraded the room type to the balcony suite.This is one cool hotel, the lobby music, the furnishings, the guests, the service-all top notch.Jia mean home, so I am told, and this hotel lives up, quite exceptionally, to its name. Our suite had a full kitchenette, 2 baths, surround sound, 2 flat screens, balcony, great gadgetry including i-pod connection to surround sound, plus a 5 star restaurant quality cooked to order breakfast each day. The hotel has a downstairs reading room, with fully stocked refrigerator where non-alcoholic drinks and espresso's are available 24/7. We rather took advantage of the available Pelligrino, Illy Coffee espressos and cappuccinos and juices at all hours, since we kept a strange work/sleep schedule on the last leg of a 15 day trip. The hotel also has quite a good happy hour with delicious olives and nuts, but we stuck to the n/a beverages by choice.The only downsides were that the hotel has no rollaways for children and there in no nightly turndown service(perhaps understaffed during low season?). Otherwise the location, hotel, service are hard to beat in Shanghai at any price.I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone coming to Shanghai. "
jia shanghai ,"Top 10 I have probably slept in 1000+ beds round the word. Hotels, Motels, friends houses, B&amp;B's, sleeping bags and the back seat of a few cars....The JIA is now one on my 10 ten places to stay in the world. Something different, fantastic interior design with a great staff supporting this unique concept.I stayed in the 1 bedroom suite and would recommend it to anyone, my Mom or the Sultan of Brunei. Downright cool.Two things that need work. - The huge, hi-tech TV has what it seems only 5 channels.... and the late night room service is weak, no noodles or rice in Shanghai?I'll be back ! ! ! "
jia shanghai ,Wonderful Nice hotel sits in a traditional building. Location is ok given steps from subway station. Room decoration was stylish.If you interst to try some local style.. you can have your breakfast close by. It cost us ~USD2/person only. 
jia shanghai ,"There's no place like JIA. Where do I even begin? Like the previous reviews mentioned, JIA is a home away from home – a discreet location so removed from the hustle and bustle (but conveniently located and otherwise connected) and a fantastic retreat. It’s centrally-located on Nanjing West Road, within a 30-second walk from the Nanjing West Road Subway Exit number 2. It’s right around the corner from Wujiang street, which on one end has many trendy chain restaurants, and on another end is more of a night-market-esque “Xiaochi Jie” where Mr. Yang’s dumplings can be found. However, when I first arrived, I couldn’t even find the hotel’s entrance – it’s just two doors with “JIA” written next to it – no bellmen standing outside or giant awning. That’s the theme with JIA – you have to know what you’re looking for in order to find it.Step inside, and two staff members are dressed to the nines in form-fitting black outfits, tapping away behind a sleek Macbook. Everything about the check-in process was quick and slick – they present you with an unmarked white plastic key that you must scan in order to call an elevator. Walk down dimly-lit halls and step inside an inviting Studio room – complete with its own stove, microwave, refrigerator, flat-screen TV. There are pots and pans to cook with, as well as blue china, chopsticks, and utensils to serve it on. The wallpaper has portraits of Chairman Mao in it, and in one set of drawers, there’s the Chinese version of Monopoly, Chinese Checkers, and an English translation of The Little Red Book. It’s all in the details!The King bed was comfy, and there was also a small sitting area with a large couch, a table, and a floral-embroidered ottoman. Bathroom included a very deep bathtub, “rain” shower, and jasmine/tea-scented toiletries. The staff was extraordinarily attentive, bringing ice, extra sheets, etc. within minutes, and making dinner reservations for me as well. It’s as though they could anticipate what I wanted. (On my last day, I called to find out when checkout was. The staff member replied, “It’s at 12:00 – would you like to schedule a later checkout?).Continental breakfast was simple, yet satisfying – an ample selection of breads, cheeses, yogurt with fruit compotes, fruits, and juices. Other complimentary “treats” include afternoon tea, where there’s always a new sweet treat as well as coffee, tea, and unlimited soft drinks. From 6-8pm, there’s free wine in the lobby, as well. Definitely hit it up if you have the time, and don’t forget to leaf through some of the unique coffee table books they have. The conference room/business area includes two computer rooms with sleek iMacs and huge monitors.Two days in, a friend upgraded us from the Studio to the Balcony Suite – and oh, how sweet it was! The sitting area is massive, and has a fully-stocked bar with its own martini shaker, bottle opener, measuring cup, six shot glasses, and other tumblers. The balcony looks onto Nanjing West Road, and you can see interestingly-lit buildings at night. There’s even a small table and two bar stools, if you want to you’re your party outside. There are speakers in the ceilings in both the sitting room and bedroom, and if you’re even slightly tech-savvy, it’s easy take advantage of the different cords to connect your computer or iPod and blast your party music in the space. The suite also includes a powder room in addition to the regular bathroom.Essentially, imagine a hotel that’s both unbelievably trendy, but also back-breakingly accommodating, and you’ve got JIA. You can even giggle about it on the way out, and the staff will still indulge you. Book online, as rates there are extremely affordable. Ah, JIA, sweet JIA. "
jia shanghai ,"Amazing Stayed at JIA, a very trendy, classy hotel. The decor, cleanliness, staff were all world class. Loved the breakfast and the toiletries. "
jia shanghai ,"Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Hotel. Service exceptional, great location within walking distance of the high end brand name shopping mall. 1 min to Nanjing road west line 2 underground. 10 mins in Taxi to the French concession.I could not recommend this hotel more. Rooms felt like a home from home not your usual corporate copy cat rooms.Breakfast was great with freshly cooked eggs to order. The best part was the free wine and beer every night 6pm - 8pm. A fantastic way to unwind after a hectic day shopping and sightseeing.Only downside to our stay was the constuction site that used to be the bund. Don't bother until Expo 2010 or you will be very disaponted. "
jia shanghai ,"Impeccable Service We stayed two nights at JIA and truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel has a beautiful design and nice spacious rooms. In particular the service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and it made for a relaxing experience that there were sparkling water and softdrinks offered without charged throughout the day. In the evening JIA offers wine, olives and almonds, so we often relaxed in the lounge with a glass of wine before heading out for dinner. We also stayed two nights at URBN, and very much enjoyed our stay at both hotels. If we are to return to Shanghai we would probably spend all nights at URBN due primarily to the enchanting courtyard that URBN has. The service at JIA was, however, better and whereas URBN added many extra expenses to the final bill everything was included in the daily rate at JIA. "
jia shanghai ,"Stunning! This is a great option when staying in Shanghai as it is very well located, excellent value and a stunning and stylish environment. It is rather more like staying in ones own designer apartment than in an hotel. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, with a ‘kitchenette’ area, fabulous bathrooms and free WiFi. Good sound-proofing, superior bed linens, (although rather less great toweling) and lovely toiletries. There was no turn down service but free soft refreshments throughout the day and good free wines available between 6pm – 8pm ( although I did not receive the advertised Veuve Cliquot on arrival!) For me, after two weeks travelling in China, the free in-house laundry facility was of great benefit (even washing powder provided). The restaurant, Issimo, was most enjoyable both for a lunch and also for a very good breakfast. Restaurant staff in particular were very friendly and the food was of a high standard. I would certainly stay here again and highly recommend it. "
jia shanghai ,"Really nice boutique hotel... The hotel was modern and clean and very well decorated in a modern and comfortable style. The room was big and had a king size bed which was lovely. The bathroom was modern and had a separate walk in shower and bath with nice quality toiletries. There was a tea pot and kettle in the room to make green/ jasmine tea which I liked.I had room service when I first arrived as I was jet lagged and this was efficiently dealt with, arrived when they said it would and was very nice. I had breakfast there too which again was good. although the service for eggs was too slow and I had to leave to get to my meeting before it arrived (which was hardly the end of the world!).There was a small but functional fitness centre which I used most days. There was free unlimited water available for drinking and cleaning teeth (and making jasmine tea) and in the lobby at night there was free wine put on for guests which was a nice touch.There was also free broadband in my room which came in handy.Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient and I checked in and out in no time at all with no problems.I don't enjoy business trips much but really enjoyed my stay, it was luxurious and spacious and had enough creature comforts to feel homely - I slept better than usual as a result. I'll be staying there again when I'm in Shanghai again later this year. "
jia shanghai ,"A Winner What a great hotel - really good bedrooms, very useful foyer which is for guests only, good restaurant, great brekky, I could go on. Service beyong reproach, central location, but it could be hard to find, and the beds only had doonas (duvets) and offered no blankets which means you are too hot often in their warm climate. Shanghai itself , very clean , safe and interesting city prepping itself dor EXPO 2010 "
jia shanghai ,"Exceptionnal design... no service... Such a disappointement and especially when you see how Jia is beautiful, maybe the most incredible design i've seen in a city hotel. Every detail in the lobby, in the restaurant or in your spacious room or suite is simply crazily trendy and superb. I could even say that Jia is the nicest city hotel in the world but there is a problem: service...First of all, when you arrive in an hotel where you pay around 200 Eur per night, at least, you can expect a bit of help when you left the taxi with a lot of baggage, you expect a smile, a staff happy to welcome you in the best adress of Shanghai but it wasn't the case and we were so disappointed.Moreover, they had forgotten the welcome drink and some other details offered during the reservation procedure.Fortunately, i've informed the manager and he took the problem in hands and in the evening, the staff was already nicer and almost all the problems were solved but still, there is no turn down service. However, to apologize, the GM offered me one night free of the two nights of the stay and it's a nice gesture but i wish to find a five stars service when i'll choose again Jia cause i'll choose again this design hotel.However, i still highly recommand Jia for its perfect location in the middle of Nanjing rd, the heart of the city; for its yummy italian restaurant where you'll eat a delicious food in the most trendy and cool atmosphere; for the very comfy and large rooms and finally for this design, just unique, everywhere in the hotel....I'm sure Jia deserves more than three points but at this stage, i can't give more due to the service... "
jia shanghai ,"Almost perfect stay! They have done their lessons! Though we were not quite happy with our stay in Jia last year, we have still decided to stay at Jia during our 10 days Shanghai visit, mostly because of the perfect location. But what should I say, I was really impressed! All this small irritating things we niticed last time are gone! The service was much better, almost perfect. The rooms and lobby are stylish and nice, as they used to be. The reception staff is very efficient and helpful, The breakfast is now served upstairs in the restaurant and is much much better as before. They still serve caffee, tee and soft drinks in the lobby throughout a day, and there is still a happy hour with wine, which is gerat and unique! We have tried the italian restaurant once, which was pretty good. The place seems to be in, since the restaurant was pretty full. The bar is also nice, but they could arrange a couple of tables more. So in the whole, we felt really at home in Jia and would not hesitate to stay there next time again. "
jia shanghai ,"Without question this hotel is impressive We had originally picked the newer URBN hotel over JIA due to the hype URBN was receiving at the time - however with another two nights of our break to fill we decided to move to JIA for a change of scenery. I think moving to JIA was the best decision we made on our six week break. This hotel was an oasis in Shanghai and for those who appreciate quality and can discern true style this is where you need to stay. The lobby is both calming and cool - the complimentary afternoon tea and evening drinks in the bar are exceptional - particularly in Shanghai where even a coffee is expensive by western standards. The restaurant offers great value western style (italian mostly) cuisine - a set meal was about AUS$25. We currently live in a Philippe Starck designed apartment building and am familiar with his style - if you appreciate this and you appreciate deisgner finishes then this is the place to stay - LCD tvs, marble kitchenette, floor to ceiling gold Bisazza mosaics in the bathroom, Philippe Starck designed porcelain products, polished wood floors, thick wool rugs - exceptional quality from end to end. There has really been some money spent building this hotel and was worth every dollar I paid to stay here. The hotel manager was visible most of the time and was often seen chatting to guests and giving guidance to anyone unfamiliar with Shanghai. Avoid the rest and stay here. "
jia shanghai ,"Boutique Chique in Shanghai-Loved it! What a change to stay in a lovely small, unique, ubercool, hip biz hotel. Bang in the centre of Nanjing Road, quaint decor, outstanding crisp linened bed, amazing shower. Nice continental breakfast, albeit a bit strange to sit in a bar to have cereal!Loved the small touches, very helpful and friendly staff , who knew just about all that u wanted to ask for, resturants, parks, shopping etc.Funky gym, could do with a lap pool. Only down side of my room was no view! "
jia shanghai ,"What a great hotel - the only place to stay in Shanghai We fell in love with the Jia hotel in Hong Kong when we stayed there a few years ago, &amp; we were very excited when we heard that the same parent company planned to open a Jia in Shanghai. There was never any doubt that we would try out Jia in Shanghai as soon as we had the chance.We weren't disappointed. Jia is an uber-stylish and incredibly chic hotel right in the heart of Shanghai.The good* It's so stylish it hurts. Everything about this place just screams cool. Check out the photos on this site or on the hotel site. It's great!* The rooms are big and very comfortable. I slept very soundly thanks to black out curtains &amp; a very comfortable bed. Quality of linen was good, bed was not too hard or soft &amp; pillows were downy &amp; soft.* Air conditioning efficient &amp; quiet* The bathroom is big &amp; beautiful. The Bisazza tiling is fabulous. Excellent quality toiletries.* Every room has a kitchenette as well as comfortable sitting area (Jia means home, so the rooms are designed as your home away from home).* Free internet in the room.* Very well equipped gym.* Complimentary glass of Veuve Cliquot or cocktail on check-in.* Complimentary refreshments all day - soft drinks &amp; water all day, wine in the evening, coffee &amp; cake in the afternoon.* Fantastic location right on Nanjing Road.* Great Italian restaurant in-house.* Very good service from the staff on the front desk.The bad* [Temporary Problem] Construction next door can be noisy if you end up with the wrong room.* Toiletries were not replaced during a 4 day stay &amp; we had to ask for new shower gel.* Breakfast was only average. Continental breakfast is included in the room rate &amp; the selection is slim. Extensive menu of breakfast items available.* Breakfast is served in the bar area &amp; it can be crowded...Having stayed in numerous hotels in Shanghai, this is far &amp; away my favourite. Maybe not ideal if you love a business hotel with an extensive buffet breakfast &amp; complete business facilities, but if you want a stylish hotel in the heart of Shanghai, you can't do better than Jia! "
jia shanghai ,"Didn't want to leave Stayed at the Jia Shanghai for 5 nights, and absolutely loved it.It is a great boutique hotel, with all the right touches. Beautiful rooms, wonderful decor (love the Tom Dixon lights) and great service.Beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms are pretty special. Gorgeous bisazza tiles and lovely bathroom products.Loved the little touches like cakes in the afternoon, and complimentary wine and champers in the evenng at the bar. In a city where a dodgy Australian white can cost over $100, the fact we could have a lovely prosecco in the evening before going out was fantastic.Great location on West Nanjing Rd. Plus it is right next to Wujiang food street, where the famous Yang's Fry Dumplings is - the best dumplings in Shanghai and a fabulous 'local' experience. The French Concession area is also within walking distance.I can't rave enough about this place. Would stay there again on my next trip to Shanghai. "
jia shanghai ,"Great Boutique hotel I recently stayed at the JIA Shanghai and was very impressed by it. I have previously stayed at the JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton and this hotel compared vary favourably.The room was a great size with a very comfortable bed and I liked the fact that the stereo was set up so that I could play my ipod through it.The service was very good and whilst I didn't eat at the restaurant I did have a drink at the bar, which for a Tuesday night was pretty lively and fun.My only complaint relates to the room service, or to be precise, lack of. I was able to order food from outside and charge to my room but wasn't as convenient.I would certainly stay here again and would happily recommend. "
jia shanghai ,"LOVED IT! We stayed here for four nights, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Its location was very convenient to the West Nanjing underground station (literally one minute away) which was very useful to get around. The location was also quiet which was good.We had a standard room but it was very spacious. We loved the entertainment system and large LG TV!!! We also enjoyed the small things like the fresh apples and lollies as well. The complimentary breakfasts were nice, with fresh croissants and a choice of cereals among the selection. We also liked the free drinks, and the afternoon tea sessions. The complimentary glass of wine/champers were also a nice touch.The front desk were always helpful and friendly, and spoke good English.There are probably cheaper hotels around, but for quality and service Jia were superb.NOTE - we would recommend going down the street from the JIA to the cheap food street, fantastic street food to be eaten at very cheap prices - dumplings aplenty!!!! "
jia shanghai ,"Nice but really over priced For the first time I have decided to say goodbye to Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons etc...in Shanghai to try the famous Jia Hotel.It is nice but really OVER PRICED.A room is a room ! If you pay more, it's for the service you are going to receive. JIA can not give you the service that you are expected for this price.I will not return "
jia shanghai ,"110% Perfect I have never written a review before, but feel compelled after spending 4 incrediblenights in what I would consider one of the world's finest boutique hotels. Jiareally does feel like an opulent home rather than a hotel.I contacted the hotel directly and got a much cheaper rate for the suite thanbooking through the hotel website. I mentioned it was my husband's birthday and thenon arrival we were upgraded to a Penthouse suite which can only be described asbreathtaking and the bathroom was huge and luxurious. In the penthouse waiting forus, was a bottel of French Champagne and a fruit platter. After our long flight, thebed felt like a cloud. Prior to arrival I had organised with concierge to book some restaurants andtransfers. All of which were done so without a problem.The Penthouse, breakfast area and bar (we loved complimentary afternoon tea andevening drinks) were all immaculate and every staff member we came across veryfriendly and willing to go out of their way to make your stay as memorable aspossible. Their English was reasonable too- better than expected. I wouldn't even consider staying elsewhere next time we're in Shanghai. Even theposition was perfect. "
jia shanghai ,"Style but no substance i stayed at Jia in may 08 for a weekend.... Having stayed at top hotels around the world (Mandarin, Ritz, Aman Resorts, etc), i found the experience to be over priced and very very average. Here are some problems with Jia .1) No basic amenities - the whole point of staying at a smaller exclusive boutique hotel (as opposed to the Ritz Carltons / Marriott's of this world), is so that you can expect more personalised experience that boutique hotels are known for. - Well... for starters... if you wake up late and miss the normal lunch hour (i.e., after 2.30PM)... and need a meal... then you either need to walk out to the main street to find one... or use their &quot;Unique home delivery service&quot; which caters from outside restaurants and will reach you in a hour+. ... OR... as the reception told me.. i can eat instaht noodles provided in the pantry.. that i have to make myself... that they will charge me hotel prices for.... OK... where's the personal touch in that? - For a hotel that's priced on the high side... i think this is not acceptable. I understand that they might not be able to run a full service kitchen all day.. but given that this is a boutique hotel that's sold on its personalised experience, it should offer maybe a small menu in off peak hotels... but done really really well. - You can't even get room service coffee. - And...... the only restaurant in the hotel is closed on Sundays.... er... of all days to close a restaurant.. why would anyone pick Sundays.... ??? in the end, i had to take a taxi to the Portman Ritz a few blocks away to get myself a meal.Other than that... the decor was not bad... and staff were OK. "
jia shanghai ,"Incredible Oasis The Jia is an incredible treat and I would highly recommend for those looking for a quiet &quot;boutique&quot; experience instead of a large 5 star hotel.The design is contemporary, warm and stylish.I felt extremely &quot;comfortable&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; which is rare when you are dealing with the hussle and bussle of Shanghai.My only complaint is that the morning breakfast buffet is a little lacking when it comes to it's &quot;protein&quot; content. "
jia shanghai ,"One of the best hotels in the world I had the pleasure of staying at the Jia Shanghai for 5 days in early March. It was the tail end of a very hectic business trip and I had planned 5 days for my first stay in the stunning city of Shanghai. Several friends who lived in Shanghai had recommended a number of high end hotels in the French Concession - although they looked nice when I was touring in the area, I can definitely say that my choice to stay at the Jia was definitely the correct one.I had thought I had booked a car to pick me up but on review had forgotten to confirm this. When I called the hotel, the offered to give the cab driver directions - which they did without problems. On my arrival (around 11pm) they rapidly checked me in and wisked me up to my room. The room, a standard studio, was very spacious and incredibly stylish. They clearly had thought of everything - although it was very simply furnishes everything was incredibly comfortable and functional. The king bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in at a hotel with fluffy down pillows. The toiletries are amazing as well (ginger-jasmine sent which was beautiful esp for the flawless rainshower).There is a simple kitchen which came in handy. The free wifi is unique. The lobby is beautifully decorated with a beautiful bar/breakfast room. Although the breakfast is simple (I think people expect a continental breakfast to be a lot more) - plenty of fresh fruit, breads and pasteries (excellent by Asian standards), and great coffee. There are non-alcoholic drinks and coffee available throughtout the day for free - another major plus (soda and pelligrino for free - a very nice touch). Defnitely geared to a more western crowd.The location was prime - practically on top of the Nanjing West subway station with lots of cabs. Its also a quiet and nice location with the main food street just a block away. The staff were incredibly helpful and wrote the name of any location I needed throughout the day to make cab travel a breeze.In my mind, there is no other alternative to the Jia when staying in Shanghai - a truely magical place that is functional, stylish, and comfortable. It truly is a home away from home! "
jia shanghai ,"Very cool new place to be in Shanghai New JIA in Shanghai is fantastic!! the rooms are amazing and so stylish, the attention to detail on the design has taken some serious thought, everything you need, you have!even a little kitchen!The lobby is breathtakingly cool and is like walking into an art gallery! The staff are attentive and are always there to open the door for you when you arrive.In the rooms all the lighting is digitally programmed for moods and effects, with blue led switches, you get a great big LCD tv in every room, and 2 in the suites! you can plug your laptop into the desk , which allows your personal music to play in every room in you suite - great soundsystem too! free wireless broadband, which is nice considering most of the 5 star hotels in China still insist on charging!The location is perfect, right opposite one of my favourite malls, Citic plaza. Also within walking distance to the rip-off plaza 66 - if you really need a Prada fix!The restaurant isn't open yet , but if HK Jia is anything to go by its going to be fantastic! Currently they are running home delivery service from the local restaurants of your choice which was a great idea and my room was so nice (corner suite) I decided to stay in and have take out japanese delivered and watch tv instead of going out one night!the bathrooms are minimal and the fittings are super high quality, lovely slate flooring in the whole bathroom..I have stayed in the Shangri-la, the Hilton, Portman ritz carlton, The Westin, and more I have to say JIA beats them all!!!- I will always return for my Shanghai trips! it feels much more of a home than a hotel ! thanks JIA!

jin jiang hotel ,"Saved by the location Originally booked with another hotel but because this was (highly) recommended by a friend, we've decided to give it a go. The hotel proved to be charming upon arrival with its colonial facade however, I was dismayed to be greeted by a waif of damp odour like an old hotel. But because my partner on the other hand was more hopeful than I was since we were booked for the Club Suite, we went along with it. My mood was immediately lifted when the lift door opened. The corridor was newly renovated and so was the room. It looked exactly how it was photographed on the website so that was a relief! The layout was sensible and very spacious which I appreciated, lighting was also sufficient. There was a letter of notification that renovation works are in place &amp; will take place between 9.30am to 4.30pm. Sadly, we were awoken by the incessant drilling &amp; knocking by 8am that went on what seemed like forever, which really disrupted our holiday. Another chief problem we had was the shower area. Even whilst showering, water seeped onto the floor outside the shower area. The bathroom was flooded throughout the whole time, there was so much water it didn't have enough time to dry. In short, if not for the ideal location this wing probably wouldn't be very popular because most reviews state 'quiet' but it wasn't at all. Besides the renovation, you can also hear the traffic whizzing by. "
jin jiang hotel ,Jin Jiang Hotel Outstanding Hotel has great staff- Rooms in Cathy Garden wing are good size and very comfort. Location is within 2 blocks of stop on Subway line 1.

jin jiang hotel ,"Jewel in Luwan Good: The best thing about this hotel is that it's in the heart of the french concession district and yet away from the noise, shopping and general new money flamboyance. Nestled in the midst of a bunch of art deco buildings, this is the cheaper of it's 2 other hotels. Interiors are classy and old world, Dark wood work, crisp white sheets. Very particular about their non-smoking rooms, unusual in China. Breakfast buffet is fantastic.Bad: Rooms are not particularly noise proof and the air-cons could do with some restoration. Stingy about drinking water.Bizarre: I could swear I heard someone vacuuming at 6 AM! "
jin jiang hotel ,"Better than expected Having read quite a few reviews, I didn't expect all that much but chose the hotel anyway based on location. What a pleasant surprise. A perfectly pleasant adn well-lit room with a nice, complimentary coffee/tea set up (Cathay Gardens Building), a workout facility that offered everything I required, an inviting lobby and a terrific location. While I did not need the staff for much beyond check in/out and a few taxis, I found them very helpful. The compound's well maintained grounds were a lovely oasis from the noise of the city just on the other side of the walls. "
jin jiang hotel ,"What kind of management considers them? Following our hotel reservation in Japan for our journey to Shanghai (China) from 15 to 18 February 2009. I have check in at the Shanghai Jin Jiang Hotel on 15 February 2009 and found it not informative and interesting as I expected of five star hotel standards. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the event was spoiled by a number of management and organizational problems that seriously concern about a being in the risk of life threatening issues, suffered, accident and illness whilst on holiday that was on hotel fault with poor quality, poor management at Shanghai Jian jiang hotel.I explain each of the problems below.1- My godfather having accident at hotel lobby entrance due to door side glass with no propel caution lable that hardly possible to view at night or by elderly peoples as well no assistance by two door man who was standing at the door at the time of accident to instruct the guest even after accident do not give any help to injured guest who was down on the floor and injured by the head that cause serious bleeding and wounded eyebrows and blouses at behind of the head.2- Hotel was not offer any first aid emergency services as according to the hotel guest manager; this is a minor injury and is very common in this hotel. They do not receive any first aid medical care and thought have to wait and queue for taxi over 20 minutes at hotel lobby. They said they do not offer any transport for this kind of accident, they do not take any responsibility about guest who shelter in this hotel. After being arrive to hospital, hotel staff planning to leave the guest alone, even instructed them you have to pay by your insurance. However after being waited for 1 hour and complaint to the hotel management by phone and anger of guest about hotel services, he was treated by doctor in bill of hotel and hotel’s staff have instructed by his manager to pay for hospital bill. 3- After being treated by hospital, they leave them unattended and they have no knowledge about Chinese language, however they have managed to arrange the transport and back to hotel. After being arrived at hotel, they have received the simple apologies from the Hotel Cost Controller and he have offered them that they can received the free compensation for one night stay included compliment for dinner. But unfortunately the hotel management changes their mind by day after accident. They ask for full payment for dinner was offered by hotel management.4- Jin Jiang hotel is listed under five star hotel. I have paid the fee for being stay at five star hotel and being treated as five star hotel guest. But unfortunately, they have not given the services for what we have paid. Hotel should prepare for this kind of injury or simply call the ambulance. There is not hospitality in this hotel that being waited for taxi for injured guest.

In my reviews i'm pretty balanced and generally a positive type however there were a few things about this hotel that really irked me which is why is got a 2 when it probably scraps a 3 but IMO the service was terrible.Firstly the good bits...top location, good value, local shopping street is really handy and close enough to walk (15mins) to the main shopping precinct in Shanghai (names escapes me). Our room on the 9th floor was spacious, well furnished, comy bed, looked over the courtyard and had a decent bath (always one of my prerequistes after a hard days sightseeing) so that's the good bits.The room decor although well furnished was looking a little tired. I don't mind the 'classic' look over the current trend for uber modern suites but it was cold and draughty. Housekeeping also was a little suspect and on 2 occassions entered our suite even when the DND was on. Our main issue was with the lack of English spoken at both the reception desk and business centre. We had 2 dramas, change of flight times (by a full day) and a lost camera, and on both occassion we received absolutely no help. The staff were always wanting to bring the manager to talk to us and couldn't perform simple tasks (e.g. we asked if they could talk to China Air rep in local dialect and they refused). The ladies in the business centre were rude and unhelpful. We also asked how to report our lost camera to the police as we needed a police report for the travel ins and they couldn't care less. We also asked them to call a local number to see if we had lost the camera whilst on the Shanghai day tour and the manager appeared at our room wanting to use our phone in the room.Overall, Shanghai was great and make sure you do the acrobats show as its amazing!

jin jiang hotel ,"Good Choice!! We stayed here for 3 night and the end of our trip to China. The hotel have 3 different building, but we have no problen ,we stay at the Cathay Garden. The hotel is centraly located. Very nice decorated and rooms are very confortable. We enjoyed breakfast a lot of choices. The staff always have a big smile for you. They have diferent restaurants choices around the 3 building, but for me, the best was a Brazillean call LATINOS, great bar salad, great seafood bar and and steak.The only problen i find, is internet service is not included and around 16 dollars per day.I would however stay here again. "
jin jiang hotel ,Nice Hotel Good Location Stayed in this hotel on a business trip for three nights.Very confusing as you do not know which of the three hotels on this site you are staying at but eventually found out it was the Cathay Garden.Room was very large and modern and very comfortable.Down side for my colleague was he was very close to the lift motor so found it very difficult to sleep and as we were pushed for time did not ask for a room exchange.English is very limited here but a few smiles do get you what you want in the end.Another thing is you do have to pay for the internet and with a hotel of this standard would have liked to think this was included.I would however stay here quite happily again. 
jin jiang hotel ,"Good clean We were a group of six pax, We stayed in Cathay block of this hotel in executive rooms. This tip we got from Trip Advisor reviews. We were very happy to stay in this hotel. The Resturant opposite this block in the same hotel has 24 hrs. service &amp; served one of our best meals in our three weeks tour of China. Biggest difficulty is communication in English, no one knows the language enough to handle tourists. This facility must be improved. The house-keeping did not know 'Towel' ?! Enjoyed well spread breakfast &amp; hospitality. Should offer free internet facility &amp; better TV progms. "
jin jiang hotel ,"great hotel stayed here for one night during a business trip, hotel booked by far east office so i wasnt sure what to expect!great hotel, clean and very comfy, great buffet and good valueonly downside for me was 'no smoking' room had lingering tobacco smell, but at 11pm I wasnt going to change rooms!hotel were flexible too - a mess up with the reservation meant they had me booked in for 2 nights not 1, but cancelled the second without issuethere are 3 towers of accommodation at the hotel - check which you're in before you arrive so you dont get to the wrong building on arrival!

jin jiang hotel ,"A nice place to stay JinJiang group has 2 hotels in the same area namely the JinJiang Tower Hotel and JinJiang Hotel. The JinJiang Hotel houses 3 building - North Tower (Bei Lou), VIP Tower (Gui Bing Lou) and Cathay Garden (Nan Lou a.k.a. South Tower) which operates like 3 different hotels. I had the opportunity to stay in all four buildings.The North Tower rooms a big, a little old but has lotsa character. but the set back is the breakfast room has a canteen feeling with make shifts banquent tables. The VIP Tower houses 1 bedroom suites and 2 to 3 room residence/apartments. I was told that this tower caters mainly to government officials, which explains all the black cars parked outside. The last trip in March I was put up in the one bedroom suite. The room exudes an opulent style of the old Shanghai. The bathroom is huge.The Cathay Garden is the only renovated block and although the room is smaller, it is very nicely done up. Simple but very stylish. However, the windows in rooms on 1st and 2nd floor facing the back are frosted. This is to block the back alley view. So ask for higher floor rooms. I say this block reminds me of some small boutique hotel or an expensive club house. It's the only block that has turn down service and puts a chocolate on the bed every night.Overall if my preference is the 1 bedroom in the VIP tower, then the room in the Cathay Garden and lastly the North Tower. As for the JinJiang Tower Hotel, when i stayed there a year ago, they started to renovate some rooms. The standard rooms are just very standard, but the deluxe is huge and that's all about it is. Breakfast was served at the revolving restaurant with a nice view of the city but not sure if this is still the arrangement.Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesistate to return again. It's close to shopping and 5 minutes walk to the efficient Shanghai Metro. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Loved The Grosvenor House I have stayed at the &quot;Old Jin Jiang &quot; several times since this first visit. It was recommended to me by a friend living in China and have since taken several colleagues there whenever we visit shanghai. Its old world charm never fails to impress and it is one of my favorite places to stay when visiting China, I have always enjoyed the food and the decor . I will be taking someone there again next week, it will be his first visit to China and I feel sure he will be impressed. If you want clinically clean and modern this is not the place for you. It is clean but has character and the staff are always courteous and extremely helpful. I do not speak Chinese but have never had a problem there. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Nice and understated luxury at JJ Hotel Cathay Gardens Impressive and a bit opulent ;-) but very nice in deed. The location is great if you’re into shopping at Huaihai Rd where you’ll find anything you like. Personally I’d prefer Nanjing Dong Lu but this was an official visit to Shanghai, so I couldn’t choose.We stayed at the Cathay Gardens part of the hotel.Rooms were cold (!) but I arrived in the middle of the worst snow for decades, and insulation is not what China is best at - so that could be expected. No heating was available. However, the duvets were warm, and the hotel provided good tea-making equipment to keep you warm.The interior of the design is bright and welcoming and the rooms are well laid out and quite large. The separate shower stall is nice to have in addition to the bath tub – I hate standing up in a tub.The breakfast buffet is very good with lots of fresh fruit and many hot options, Western, Chinese and Japanese – a good start of the day.The rates for internet access is lower than other hotels (90 RMB for 24 hours), but ridiculously this is only valid for cabled access as Wi-Fi is almost double the price. Not good enough!Would I stay here again? Definitely (if I chose to stay in this part of the centre). "
jin jiang hotel ,"Old but still a nice place Stayed here at the end of a China Tour, I was in the Cathay Building which dates from way back but still offers a good level of service and accommodation.The room was fairly large with all the usual furnishings: chairs, TV, table, fridge, mini bar and safe etc. The furnishings including the beds are well made and comfortable, the bathroom is of a good size and had a very effective walk in shower, towels changed daily and plenty freebies. The room windows are the old style metal type which do open quite wide and may be dangerous for children, but the air conditioning worked well and so negated the need to open the windows much.The dining room (breakfast) is on the 11th floor and carries a huge selection of buffet style menus, plenty of choice for all tastes.I found the staff FAIRLY helpful, some did not have much English and occasionaly I felt they played on that.There is a very well equiped fitness area and swimming pool in an adjacent building, the pool is large and when I visited it was staffed.There are a good selection of shops quite close by and I felt the area was safe. "
jin jiang hotel ,Errvery mixed feeling This is an old establishment in Shanghai in a very good location. However there are two wings if i am not mistaken and the cheaper and older wing is terrible by all accounts. I first booked two rooms via one website and we were led to this rundown building where one 'receptionist' was working behind a miserable table. The corridor outside the rooms looked something lifted out from a horror movie and the rooms we had had foul smell. This building looks more like a servant's quarter to me. I had to call the operator and requested for a change of room- which turned out to be the pricier rooms/suites at another building. The suites are very good.The staffs at the desk and the bell captains were mostly obnoxiously rude and unfriendly. 
jin jiang hotel ,"Great Stay in Shanghai When my company arranged for me to stay at this hotel I immediately checked the web for reviews. I was disappointed by what I read however I am happy to say I had an unexpectedly GREAT stay at this hotel. The room was clean, modern and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable, I slept well. The receptionist was pleasant and attentive to my needs. The bell staff was prompt and efficient. The buffet breakfast was fresh and there were plenty of choices. All in all I really enjoyed this hotel and I would stay here again. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Scene out of the Exorcist Stayed there for two nights. Seriously awful. I got in at about 11pm in the night and they gave me a room in the more historcal Cathay Garden. I tried to run myself a bath, and all these green water suddenly came gushing out of the bathroom and there was a massive flood all over the place. Reception wasn't very enthusiastic when I called for a change of room. Only after some prolonged reasoning, did they reluctantly get me a room upgrade to a bigger room in another building. (I was tired beyong tired) First floor and no view - a wall stared back at me when I opened the blinds. I would definitely recommend everyone to get breakfast at anywhere but the hotel cafe. If you are in Shanghai for business, think twice about the location. The streets are eternally filled to heavy traffic. It would take you about 35 minutes to get to Pudong business districts. Not withstanding taxi drivers cursing at you for dragging them to such a far-off location. Careful when you schedule your flight out. I tried to finish off my meetings in Pudong at about 5:00, thinking a half hour drive back to grab my bags then another half hour back to Pudong Airport should leave me sufficently cushioned for a 7:30 flight. No! It takes me two instead. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Worth a look elsewhere The only reason I stayed at the Jin Jiang for 2 nights was it's location. After my stay there I would have preferred to stay somewhere nicer and travelled.When checking in the girl behind the counter gave nothing but attitude, everything I asked for was an issue. Simple requests were always met with a sigh. Luckily the bell staff helped me out and were great. The room (in the Southern Building) was weird. The bathroom and shower room was larger that the bedroom/entrance room.The living area was more like a Motel than a hotel with only minimal facilities and the carpet was stained and dirty.The bathroom and shower were clean and neatThe restaurant and bar were OK, small and the service was slow. They divide the smoking and non-smoking dependent on who is there, I was sitting next to a non smoker table but when he left, four gentleman were seated and the no smoking sign removed.The location is not good if you are looking to sightsee (I was there for meetings).I would advise looking elsewhere if you are looking for a nice hotel. "
jin jiang hotel ,"loved the Jin Jiang Cathey Garden Stayed at the Jin Jiang Hotel Cathey Garden for three nights on a business trip. There are several Jin Jiang hotels in Shanghai, but the Jin Jiang Hotel's Cathay Garden is great, not to be confued with other Jin Jiang properties.The rooms we had were exceptionally new, clean and plush. Great bathroom with separate tub and shower. The lobby was cozy and warm with the addition of a lobby library. The location is unbeatable. The fitness room was adequate, but a bit warm and stuffy being in the basement. The breakfast buffet provides a very good variety of western and chinese dim sum which changed daily during our stay. Will definitey stay there again! "
jin jiang hotel ,"Very Local But Interesting So I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at the Jin Jiang. I got a pretty good price and thought it might be interesting. It is an attractive compound of buildings, with three separate towers in art deco style. Unfortunately, that meant that I had to wander into one of the buildings when I arrived to discover my room was somewhere else. They did take me there in a golf cart. The check in at the Grosvenor House was slow and somewhat inefficient. As I finally sat down at the desk to go through the check-in ritual, I saw the front desk attendant pull up my reservation, and when she clicked on my reservation, a text box popped up that said &quot;This is a dirty room.&quot; When I asked her about that, she said, worryingly, 'Oh it's nothing.'The room was large, and somewhat dark and cavernous. I thought the details of the room was actually quite attractive, a continuation of the art deco style. It was not dirty, at least as far as I could tell. There was only wireless internet access, and you had to go downstairs to get your username and password. My colleague staying in the same building said he couldn't get access at all and eventually had to give up.The location is quite nice though, and the outer courtyards seemed nice. I used the small gym, which was fine since I was the only one there.There were two restaurants nearby that I thought were both rather good - a Shanghainese place called Jade Garden just south on Mao Ming Nan Lu, and Di Shui Dong, a cheap and charming Hunanese place just a block to the north.I could sort of tell it was a local hotel by the phone call I received at midnight as I was going to bed about whether I was interested in a massage. At least she didn't call back when I said no. Perhaps this was what was meant by 'dirty room'? So it was alright, and an atmospheric ambience in terms of the architecture. But the 'software' of the place still seems to be a beta version and could be improved. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Never Again We ended our two week tour of China in Shanghai and where booked in the Jin Jiang for three nights. We wanted to change hotels before theend of the first day. We had three rooms that where to be on the samefloor - they where not. When we where checking in the desk staffnever looked at us, one room was a smoking room when we had requestednon smoking, that was the first move. The second was when there was no king bed in the suite as requested, the third move was when they could not get the smell of urine out of the suites bathroom. When we took the children to the swimming pool there was an $11 dollar chargeper person to use the hot tub. We tried to change hotels that night but could not find a hotel that could accomidate all our requests that evening. We did move the next day to the JC Mandrine and had a lovely stay. We are still waiting on the refund from our unused nights at the Jin Jiang. We should have suspected something when our guide was checking us in and said that her agancy had not used this hotel in ten years, I suspect it will be another ten beforethey try it again. "
jin jiang hotel ,Do not book regular executive room Nice hotel with nice decor but lobby bar staff could be friendlier and more helpful. I booked an executive room and I am very very disappointed because the windows are frosted and I cannot see outside. The website also does not states very clearly that windows are frosted. I can't even check the weather before stepping out. It is so frosted that I cannot tell if it is raining outside. They were not helpful in helping me change to another room. 
jin jiang hotel ,"Traditional hotel in Shanghai Jin Jiang Hotel is a more traditional Chinese hotel in a city that has a large number of very modern hotels built in the last 10 to 15 years. However, the hotel still meets a lot of the standards of Western type hotels. But, this is not really ritzy or flashy. The style is more “renovated old” as opposed to big towers newly built. There are several buildings all referring to Jin Jiang. I stayed in the Cathay House which is the entry level I believe. Other buildings had suites and larger accommodations but at a higher price as well. RoomRooms seem to be quite large, with enough space for a queen size bed, a desk and a couch and coffee table. (See pictures). The bathroom is very nice as well with separate walk in shower. The style dates a little bit but it’s not ancient. The room I was in was at the end of the hallway (707). It meant that it had a hallway (nice) but small windows which didn’t provide a lot of light for the room. It’s not a problem if you are out and about visiting or having meetings but if you intend to stay and work in your room, you may find it a bit dark. Other rooms had larger windows right in the middle of the room which provided more light. In the room, there was a mini fridge. HotelThe breakfast room is on the 11th floor. Buffet style with lots to choose from. The gym is in another building within the complex. It’s not convenient especially when it’s cold outside or when it rains. It has a nice swimming pool though. The reception is nice but not grand. Don’t expect a large open foyer like newer hotels. OtherInternet connection was available. A cable is in the room and it works fairly well, including Skype. The area around JJ is very pleasant with a good mix of large shopping centers and but also a large number of small shops , some directly on the streets, others hidden in the back of buildings. The newer neighborhoods, especially in Pudong will not offer such a variety; only large shopping centers where the well known brand names are available at pretty much the same prices than everywhere else in the world. The Subway station is one block away as well as a small supermarket located in the basement of a department store. All things considered, the Jin Jiang Cathay House is a very adequate hotel for both leisure and business travelers. They will find a good mix of amenities in a more authentic Chinese environment. Something that is not necessarily offered in the other very modern parts of the city. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Recommended Stayed two nights in the hotel, very happy to recommend it to anyone. We had a twin room (super-sized single beds), there was lots of floor space, a sofa and chair, writing desk. Bathroom was large with good toiletries, a bath and separate shower, and there was plenty of extra space in a small lobby containing the closet, fridge, safe etc. Staff were pleasant and polite, especially the young men opening doors, getting taxis etc. English was spoken. Breakfast was delicious, good variety of dishes and no-one should go hungry at this hotel. Situation is close to shopping, not far from the old French area, restaurants are close - there's plenty for all tastes. The hotel has gardens, it wasn't noisy.Only two small complaints: the bed was VERY hard, and the 'view' from the 2nd floor window was a large aircon duct. But we kept the shutters closed and were out during the day anyway so it didn't matter. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Good hotel to experience Shanghai We stayed at the hotel as business travelers and were quite happy with th accomodations. We upgraded to Cathay Garden, the new part of the hotel. The hotel is unique in that it sits on several acres of green space rather than being flushed against the roads that can be quite noisy. The rooms we stayed at are very new and well put together. They have non-smoking floor so make sure you INSIST on it if you want that. We only ate at the hotel for breakfasts but it is perfectly adequate for that purpose. For about $150 per night, I felt that we got a very good hotel room for its price relative to all the other western branded business hotels. The hotel is located near Mao Ming South Road, a fairly upscale street that offers very good shopping. It is located near the old Shiang Yang Market, the gigantic flea market that has since been torn down. For your imitation designer handbags, you will have to go search else where. But your average concierge desk will surely be able to direct you. Right outside of the hotel, however, is where a lot of custom tailors are. Be sure to visit these stores on your first day. They can often finish custom shirt in two days or even a suit in four.Getting a cab can be tough around dinner time. So walk out of the hotel ground and grab a cab on the road. You will have better luck.One word of advice on traveling to China - go through your local Chinese travel agents to book hotels. They often have much better deals than you can get off Internet. The deals one get off the internet usally does not include free breakfasts and taxes and that can add up. Make sure you ask for the breakfast deals because eating breakfasts in China can be a hassle and a la carte is very expensive....Also, the Chinese hotel staff can sometimes be non-chalant when it comes to customer service. Unlike the US/European hotels where better service may come with a $20 bill, it doesn't always happen in China. Be insistent when you need something that you feel is within your rights - such as a clean non-smelling non-smoking room. Don't yell (as it only degrades your status) but be insistent and prepare to escalate to a manager (who is always around...) "
jin jiang hotel ,"Definite 4 star hotel We booked 3 nights at the &quot;old&quot; Jin Jiang Hotel and was very happy with our accomondations. Yes, it is a older hotel with high ceilings and oak wood trimming, but it seemed very well kept. We also really liked the separate shower and large marble tub. (yes, one of the the four-pronged faucet handles did come off, but it was simple to screw the porcelain handle back on.) Located on one of the fashion streets of Shanghai (mao ming), it is also across from the dickson center (locale for ralph lauren and gucci, among others). Taxi are so cheap in Shanghai, it is only about $3 or $4 cab ride from the Bund, Pu Dong, the Imperial Gardens, and less than that to the Shanghai Museum. If you want to use the subway, the station is just a long block away. Service at the hotel was excellent, and the staff very friendly and sufficiently adequate in their english speaking skills. On site facilities include a heated pool and a bowling alley, available to all guests. We also found a very good accupressure massage place on the same block for less than $15 a hour, and that included a 20% tip. And DVD hounds can find a vendor within 2 blocks, offering DVDs for about $1.20 per. However, not every DVD will work on US systems. Very safe locale. I would recommend it highly although wheelchair accessibility is not the greatest. They have a step down entry into their lobby, with their wheelchair ramp off to the side which is also used for baggage carriage. "
jin jiang hotel ,"if you're noise-sensitive avoid Room 1023 I left Salvo Hotel after enduring it for one night and booked myself a room in Jin Jiang for five nights. I have stayed in Jin Jiang Tower before, and althoug my husband remembers it as a horrible experience (with construction going all over the place and rude staff) I remember it as a great experience esp. because the great breakfast joint right outside the hotel and its proximity to Huaihai Road, a prime shopping street in Shanghai, with Lane Crawford, Isetan, and Taipingyang Department stores (if you want to shop for someting semi-fashionable don't go to Nanjing Road, it used to have interesting things but I increasingly find it hard to spot anything that whets my consumer appetite there on Nanjing Road--although it has its own charms, it is no longer a shopping street). When I got to Jin Jiang, we got Room 1023. Given that we booked the cheapest rate of listed price on Expedia we were very happy we got a room on a high floor. And the room was stunningly quaint and nice, it was so spacious, and with the knowledge that it used to be a guesthouse for French colonialists (?), I could see those French people dancing in the very room we were in (it was that big) during the 1930s. The bathroom had a huge bathtub and a separate shower stall, which really pleased me. My sister found a bug (it wasn't a roach, but something similar, we kind of decided not to pursue it because we were still excited about the size of the room) she quickly caught it released it from the window. The location was indeed great, too. So we went out and shopped, ate and went back to the hotel at around 9:00PM. We noticed some noise coming from upstairs. We weren't sure what it was, but it was some kind of light construction noise. It went on until very late at night, but we thought it was fine because we turned on the TV and it cancelled the noise from upstairs. But there was also some music coming from the left side of the room, and it did not stop until I called the front desk at 3:00AM and told them about the music (in Chinese). The person who picked up the phone immediately realized what the problem was and he said he'd take care of it. The music stopped. I wonder what it was but it was still fine.Then, my sister left and my husband joined me in the same room. He's relatively sensitive to noises. He just couldn't stand the knocking noise from upstairs, and kept complaining to the front desk about it. The front desk person ket telling him he/she'd find out, but they never returned his calls. Once they even went upstairs to &quot;find out&quot; what it was and try to stop it but it did not stop. Then we realized that our room was right underneath the kitchen of a restaurant on the 11th floor. The noise was coming from a chef chopping things on a chopping board, cutting chicken bones, etc. It really didn't bother me but my husband couldn't stand it. He tried to change the room, but somehow they refused (the hotel apparently had many empty rooms but they kept telling him it was fully booked). When he finally went to the assistant manager and talked to him in a very upset manner they decided to move us to another room. I really didn't mind the noise so much, so I'd have been fine in Room 1023. But for those who have aversion to noises coming from upstairs (incessant chopping noise) it'd be better if you avoid this particular room. "
jin jiang hotel ,"5-star hotel 1-star service I booked my room at Jinjiang via an online travel agent and pre-paid the hotel charges. When I arrived, the booking was screwed up and the hotel was more concerned about receiving payment from me than allowing me to check in first before clearing up the mess. I had to wait in the cold lobby for ONE hour, tired and hungry from my 2-hour car journey from Suzhou. The room given to me had dirty patches on the wall and there was some renovation work going on in the floors above (incessant drilling during the day). The staff were cold and impersonal. Jin Jiang still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the likes of Shangri-la, where I stayed in Beijing. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Great Location Very Nice Hotel The Jin Jiang is a lovely old hotel which is very convient to all sorts of shopping, food and some entertainment. I stayed there for 6 nights in March 2006. I stayed in 2 different rooms and they were of similar quality. The beds are as hard as a rock, but I still slept well. This hotel uses white duvet covers that mark easily. So, you can be assured you're getting a fresh cover. They are in the process of replacing the carpets, which will definitely help the appearance. We watched (and heard) them do the 9th floor. Housekeeping could do a better job in the bathrooms. The first room I stayed in had a large collecting of slimy material around the shower drain. Unfortunately, the tile is black so it might be hiding all sorts of things I don't want to know about. We also saw 2 small roaches, one in a room and one in the lobby. However, we saw a lot of roaches on our journey, so this wasn't terribly shocking.There really is no bar in the old section of this hotel. There's a place to get a drink, but it was more like a tea room. So, don't expect nightlife. The convenience store on the 2nd floor is fabulous. We actually found that bottled water was cheaper in the hotel store than in most other places. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Lovely well situated hotel I stayed in the Cathay Building for a week. Rooms-----The room was spacious and comfortable. It was nice having a foyer/dressing room between the bedroom area and bathroom, and it was useful having a writing desk, chairs, and sofa in the room. Bathroom was also spacious and well presented with a separate bath and shower. The only complaint about my room was that the windows were quite narrow (although there were six of them), making it hard to appreciate the view outside. Shanghai is a noisy city but the hotel is set back off one of the main streets, making it reasonably peaceful.Dining------I only ever ate breakfast but the buffet was satisfactory, with a selection of english, continental, and chinese foods available; all of which were of good quality. Service-------Staff were friendly and attentive and I had no problems talking to them in Englsih. As I would expect from a 5* hotel.Overall-------I would stay at the Jin Jiang again as it is ideally located for the main city sights and I enjoyed my time there without any problems. However, the Grand Hyatt is a cut above and offers amazing views of the city (but probably at a higher price). "
jin jiang hotel ,"Great Place We had a huge room and huge bathroom in the GrosvenorHouse at the Jin Jiang Hotel. We also had a hugesecond room (without requesting it). The hotel is fairly priced and is an Art Deco gem, left much the way it was in 1935 (with updated facilities). Thestaff was very attentive, with passable English (notas good English as 5 star places). The grounds arebeautiful and off the street, which gives a peaceand quiet not common in Shanghai. Good free b'fastbuffet. Across the street is the Okura Hotel, also with a great garden. We had a lousy meal at the OldShanghai Moon Restaurant in the hotel. Too many smokers and mediocre food. French Concession areais great for walking. Taxis very cheap to rest ofShanghai. We took a great tour (4 hours) of JewishShanghai. In sum, we loved the Grosvenor House. Itwas our favorite place in a 3 week Asian trip. "
jin jiang hotel ,"Motel not hotel I paid five star prices for this hotel and got a room that smelled, the faucets were falling off, the marble of the bathtub cracked and they did not even provide bedskirts. The walls were filthy. I will definitely not recommend this hotel. For the price of what we paid (140 US), I would have rather stayed at the Mason Hotel on Huai Hai Road. The staff were not helpful at all. We did not expect that from a &quot;5*&quot; hotel. Very disappointed. Be ware! "
jin jiang hotel ,"Disappointed My wife and I stayed at the &quot;old&quot; Jin Jiang in 2002, and was quite disappointed with the experience. We reserved a room in the Grosvenor House, but the hotel closed that building (it was right after the SARS epidemic) and consolidated all the guests into the Cathay Mansion. The hotel gave us a very big suite instead, which we thought was a nice gesture. But the condition of that room was quite horrible: the carpet was very dirty and there were air pockets underneath all over, big enough that we tripped on them; the marble in the bathroom by the tub was cut too short, and they just used caulk to fill in the hugh gap; the wall in the living room was patched up but was not painted over, so you can see this big rectangular mark on the wall. None of this affected our sleep, and the suite was big enough for a family. The hotel staff was generally nice, although not all of them were proficient in English. We were disappointed because from what we read and how much we paid, we expected a very nice hotel. "

jin jiang tower hotel ,"Just Reasonable From outside it looks like it is a new hotel but it actually is a old hotel. Some rooms have been recently refurnished. However, I did not very much like it. I wouldn't call it 5* quality at all.The best thing is its revolving restaurant on 41st floor which lets you have a good view of the city. However, service in that restaurant is not up to the mark. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Service was surprisingly good for a Chinese-run hotel My husband and 1-yr old baby stayed overnight here for our friend's wedding, which was at this same hotel. The overall facility and our room were clean, comfortable and nice. Maybe because our expectations for a Chinese hotel weren't that high, we ended up really enjoying our stay. First off, we didn't have to remind them to bring in the baby crib (they brought it into the room promptly). Even with the crib there was still plenty of room, and ours was just the standard room (it was called Superior). Since I can speak Chinese, I'm not sure how the staff's English level is. But what really impressed us was, the hotel was very efficient in finding the things we left in the room after we checked out, AND mailed them out to our home address the same day (we paid for shipping of course). Maybe this kind of service is assumed as normal for a Western hotel, but for a Chinese hotel, I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to wait for weeks for my stuff to be mailed out, if at all. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Not bad I read the other reviews and I found the hotel to be not bad at all.The first room we stayed in was ultra modern although a bit small; 42&quot; plasma TV, good bed, etc; one problem: the wall separating the bathroom from the rest of the room was all glass. That rules out visitors, to say the least.In the room we found a coffee maker, a small fridge, cups and saucers, some cutlery, etc.After the cruise we stayed in a different older room that was actually much better; needed some paint, but it was larger, and had a more traditional bathroom.We liked the buffet for dinner and the food in the lobby; there is a small gift shop where one can buy water and other drinks, though the hotel supplies two free bottles of water a day, as do most other hotels.Everybody was actually very helpful, although English was definitely not fluently spoken; but they did try and we managed. The concierge was, however, a bit useless.The location was adequate, though personally I would have preferred a more central location, near the pedestrian mall or the Yu Yuan Gardens. We found our best souvenirs in the small towns during the river cruise. I don't think the shopping in Shanghai is as great as everybody makes it sound.We did experience the unrelenting noise from the construction site nearby; this is all over Shanghai now, since they are preparing for the World Expo next year. The Bund, for instance, is a mess.All in all, it was a pleasant experience, though next time I would go for the J.W. Marriott's better location. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Good Location Jin Jiang was my last stop. I had finished all my Business meetings and wanted to stay in a good shopping area for 2 days. The Rooms were lovely, tariff not too bad, but the staff was extremely cold and tried to charge for the complimentary water to discourage me from asking for water - since I do require more than a couple of small bottles a day! The massage parlour staff, too, forced a big tip out of me. The good thing about this Hotel is that there are a lot of good shopping places close by. The Buddha Jade Temple is also not too far off. Lots of nice restaurants around to chose from. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Bad Hotel I stayed a total of 22 nights in March/April and 20 nights February which is more than enough to give an opinion.The first time I stayed in the standard rooms on the lower floor, the rooms themselves were bright and modern, the cleanliness was good on moving in but after that depending on the cleaner was hit and miss.Second time of staying, I upgraded to the executive rooms floor 35 which for a few extra £'s is a better deal.Bad points: If you want piece and quite this is not the hotel for you, granted when moving in there was a letter on my desk saying they were carrying out some works in the day, ok not a problem. What they don't tell you is they don't care what time of day they start or finish. The drilling was so laud I could not hear my TV, if you want the noise to stop you have to complain. The first time I had to complain was when I got back from work at 8.30pm and the drilling and noise was still underway. The second time of complaining was at 07.30am, this hotel doesn't give a dam about their guests.The rooms give the impression that you can adjust the air co but as I found out that is not the case. When I asked about the room temp I was advised to move rooms which I did but did not solve the problem. The room temp is fixed centrally; my room was between 26 &amp; 28 very uncomfortable. You can't leave the windows open because of noise.The food in the hotel is very poor indeed, from the revolving restaurant to room service.There are far better hotels in Shanghai and I wouldn't stay here again.It also gets tire some when coming back from work later in the evening to be joined in the elevator by free lance prostitutes offering their services. Outside the main door of the hotel, they allow street traders to hassle you to buy knock off merchandise, myself and other guests complained several times and the problem for now has gone away. I stay in hotels 9 to 10 months of the year around the world so I know how I like things to be when I’m paying. The first time of staying I didn’t have to suffer the noise the food was just as bad we there are plenty of places to eat outside. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Don't Believe the Hype Based on the appearance, the hotel seems quite nice. However, the shower leaked and the toilet kept running. Also, the Business Center was not a good deal. They charge RMB 3 per minute and the computer is super slow and outdated. What a great scam.If your Chinese is limited (like mine) don't expect to get too much help from the staff. Several of them didn't know how to help me say &quot;The Bund&quot; in Chinese - I believe the concierge misdirected us on 2 separate occasions. There are some very good restaurants within walking distance. Xintiandi and Nanjing Road are both fairly close by taxi (approx RMB 11-14). "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Overall very good Shanghai hotel Pros: Location, newly renovated rooms, good serviceCons: Bad breakfast buffet: dry bread, horrible sushi. We checked in early, coming straight from the train from Bejing, and upgraded, so we could check in at 8.00 am. We were told, that there was a complimentary breakfast - for 1 person ... - so we went up and had the buffet - It was really not worth the money - and afterwards, we were told, that the offer did not apply to the day we checked in ... Had we known this, we would definately not have eaten there. But apart from this misunderstanding, the overall impression was good. Nice, new room and OK staff. The location in the French concession was very good. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Great Hotel for Fashionistas Jin Jiang Tower is at the center of Shanghaiboutique shopping. Within blocks there areclose to a thousand specialty clothing storeswith some great products and unbelievablepricing.That's about the only thing good about it.The place litterally &quot;stinks&quot;. The lobby andelevators have a putrid stench. Apparentlythe gardeners in the atrium don't maintainthe plants and the roots are rotting.Well that's not all that is rotten. The serviceis rotten too. The Jin Jiang Tower has the laziest and mostrude staff of any hotel in Puxi. The updated rooms have nice decor, the view is nice,location is great. Try to get a cab there. Good luck!Better go out and take your chance to flag down oneon Changle Lu. The doorman is too busy smokingcigarettes and yacking with his buddies.Better bring a cart with you, there aren't any bellboys in sight. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Pretty good - nicely renovated I stayed here for two nights as part of a tour group. The hotel was certainly very nice especially the recently renovated rooms. The bed was very comfortable, the flat screen TV with many many channels, the bathroom was well stocked with amenities, and the room view was fantastic. The hotel is located in the older part of town with the nice grand olde Shanghai charm. Many upscale shops and restaurants within blocks, some just around the corner. With the room rate, it included breakfast in the top level rotating restaurant. The view was unmatched almost anywhere in Shanghai. There are over five food stations with one custom cooking chinese noodles, and one custom cooking eggs. Many many choices, including some dim sum. Do not forget about the swimming pool and the huge sauna on the sixth floor. The sauna has three fullsize heated pools, steam room, with full back scrub and massage services. I went there both nights to relax after long days of walking tour and shopping walks. There are two minor point I wish the hotel would consider improving. First and foremost, the internet connection fee was way too high, $180 rmb for an hour, Come on! Second is that the quality of staff may fluctuate. Although everyone was very friendly, I encountered two who just went through the motion. It is a little bit far from the bund. The choices was walk three long blocks and take subway two long station away, or a take a taxi costing about $25 rbm. However, we had so much fun shopping in the neighborhood, my shopping buddies did not see any need to go to the Nanking Road shopping area. One of them bought a new suit-case just to fill the clothing she bought. So if you have concerns of staying here, I would ignore all previous reviews regarding the outdatedness of this hotel. The renovation was wonderfully done and has transformed this hotel as one of my favorite in town. (mind you, I have stayed in two other Shanghia hotel before). "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Adequate hotel with good location My friend and I stayed two days at Jinjiang Tower as part of the holiday package offered by our travel agency. The hotel isn't exactly five stars by international standard, but we have no major complaints. The hotel is conveniently located near Huaihai Road, with eateries such as Hong Kong Xinwang cafe and Bifengtang restaurant just round the corner. The nearest subway station - Shaanxi South is also only about 7 to ten minute walk. A cab ride to Xintiandi and major shopping district cost only about RMB 13-15. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the decor updated with a LCD TV - complete with premium international channels such as CNN, HBO, BBC, Deutsche Welle etc. Our only problem is with the wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom that we found awfully weak. Other than that, we had an overall comfortable stay at Jinjiang Tower and would consider staying there again. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Great hotel great location - make sure you get an updated room I had a lot of apprehension staying at this hotel. While it was the &quot;first five star hotel&quot; in shanghai, it certainly didnt appear to be what americans would consider 5 star (at least not anymore). however, the location and hotel rates were too good to ignore. as of june 2008, the rooms on the executive floor, while larger and coming with perks (free breakfast, internet etc), were not updated. my fiance had stayed there in january and march on the executive floor and found the rooms &quot;dated&quot;. to my pleasant surprise, when we arrived we were put into a very updated room (fairly modern). we got the deluxe king room on the 13th floor (34 sq meters)the room came with every possible bathroom amenity (shampoo, conditioner etc, toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, comb, cotton.... you really didnt need to bring anything). the room also came with two complimentary bottles of water daily. internet was fairly expensive at 120 RMB for 24 hours, but connection was easy to set up and fast. very centrally located... and the concierge all speak english and are willing to help. we enjoyed a great breakfast every morning on the 41st floor - they had such a wide selection of foods to choose from. the restaurant rotates, so you can get a great view of the city as you dine. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Good choice hotel in good location I spent several days at the Jin Jiang Tower Hotel as part of a large group and overall my experience was very good (yes, except for the musty smell in the lobby, but that's the way it goes in humid areas). The rooms, albeit on the smaller side, are all newly refurbished in a sleek IKEA-look with excellent lighting - even small reading lights by the beds - something hard to find in even the glitziest hotels in the world.The bathroom is fine as well and is stocked with everything you possibly need, from razors to tooth brushes to wooden combs. The only negative here, as noted by another traveller, is the hair dryer stuck in a drawer - you will have to bend down to dry your hair, but at least the hair dryer is powerful.The gym is a bit small with just a few machines, there is also a larger terrace area where you can jog outside (if you do not prefer to jog through the city as my room mate did every morning - the park is not too far from the hotel).The indoor pool is very nice and large enough for 4 - 5 people swimming laps at once, I did not notice too much chlorine, on the contrary, I found the water rather fresh, clear and clean. Please note to bring a swimming cap as this seems to be &quot;mandatory&quot; in all Chinese hotel pools. (They did not enforce it strictly at this hotel). There is also a vapor sauna and a hot tub in the changing room areas.Now, the one and only thing that was TOTALLY worth the stay at this hotel is the breakfast. Never before have I seen such an abundance, there are buffet tables after buffet tables of food of all varieties: Japanese breakfast, Korean breakfast, Singapore noodles, Spaghetti, soups, Chinese dumplings, American breakfast with eggs of all kinds and also European style items, ranging from fresh rolls to one of the best dark grainy breads I have ever tasted etc etc etc. And did I mention it is served on the 41st floor in a revolving restaurant? You get a 360 degree view over Shanghai, quite amazing. This way I was able to fill up on breakfast and escape the sometimes well too average group food we were served during our trip.Another tip: Not far from the hotel you will find Cafe Costa on HuaiHuai Road for a quick and delicious caffeine fix. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Between great and terrible Excellent: rooms, location, space, breakfast room.Bad: staff, lobby smell, services.Mixed feelings here. Rate was good. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Not bad great location This hotel is certainly not one of the newer ones in town. It probably was THE place to stay when it first opened, but it's beginning to show its age. The location cannot be beat because it's one block off Huai Hai Road which is one of the main shopping drags in the city. You can walk to a lot of restaurants as well, but be warned that it's several blocks from the Metro stop. If you want a decent moderately priced hotel with a very central location not too far from People's Square and the Grand Theater, this one should do. (If you want a great moderately priced hotel, you can go to the Eton on the Pudong side but it's off the beaten path.) There are better hotels with better locations but they are much higher priced. This one is run by the Chinese government so it's not quite at the same level as the luxury hotel chains, but if you don't spend lots of time in your hotel room, this one is more than adequate. The room we stayed in on the 21st floor was a solid B+ in terms of size, quality and cleanliness and the staff is accommodating enough. No complaints about noise at all. We didn't eat at the revolving restaurant on the 41st floor other than for the breakfast buffet. I wouldn't recommend it for the Chinese food, but it had lots of variety and the food was fresh. I don't have any real complaints other than the elevators can be a bit slow and the hair dryer in the vanity drawer had an extension cord that was too short forcing you to kind of bend over to dry your hair. The swimming pool was large and clean but the chlorine was on the heavy side. The women singing at the lobby piano bar in the evenings was a nice touch. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Location location location The Jin Jiang Tower was recommended by a Chinese friend living in Shanghai and married to a European expat. She booked the hotel for me and got great rates. It's not the same 5 stars standards as the Ritz-Carlton, I'd rate it as a good American 3+ stars but it's such a good value as the hotel is in the best location in Shanghai, in the middle of the French Concession district, wonderful restaurants and shopping and everything else. I've stayed in Shanghai on 4 different trips in 4 different hotels and this is my favorite. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Not an international 5 Star but pretty good I stayed at the JJ Tower for a week. It was my first time to Shanghai and I wanted a nice place for a reasonable price. The JJ Tower was a quite good. My room was very nice, recently renovated and had a great view from the 21st floor. The cleanliness wasn't great. The cleaning staff put very little effort into cleaning the bathroom and carpet... I'd hate to see what a UV light would pick up.The food at the hotel restaurant was edible, service was poor but the view made up for it. The other service in the hotel was satissfactory. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly and had decent english skills. The Business center was well equipped and internet terminals are provided. Broadband is provided in each room, but not wireless.The location is great. It's very close to Xian Tan Di (10 min walk) and the Bund (10-15 min by Taxi). There were lots of great boutiques and restaurants within 2-4 blocks (Starbucks and McD's 4 blocks away).Definately a great place to stay if you're budget is under $200 US / night. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Not bad but needs some refurbishing Stayed recently at this hotel with my wife. She and some of her friends have stayed here before and as business travelers, they have found it to be ok. Smoking is allowed in most hotels in China and Japan, so if you mind, make sure you reserve a non-smoking room. We forgot to add that detail, so when we arrived we were given a twin room in a smoking floor. As my wife's pregnant, we demanded a non-smoking room and got upgraded to a twin room at their executive floor, on the 34th floor. We had no problem with the upkeep of our room, but the hotel is somewhat old and needs some refurbishing. This is quite evident in the revolving restaurant, where a well-stocked and varied buffet breakfast is served daily, especially as anyone can notice that the panoramic windows' metallic mesh blinds are rusty or stained and some have been haphazardly repaired. My wife and I both speak fluent Mandarin, but we used English at the front desk and with their phone operators, and they had good, if a bit slow, English skills. There are many small shops and eateries near the hotel and a few minutes' walk takes you to a road with many Western brand boutiques. The subway station is a good twenty minutes away, and not that easy to find, but taxicabs are plentiful and not expensive. Wished I had tried their 6th floor pool but didn't have the time. The Xintiandi district of restaurants, galleries and shops is about 30 mins. by foot. We were in Shanghai in late September and it was 28 degrees Celsius but very humid. Our Shanghai friends say that this was cooler weather, but we sweated a lot. By the way, there are many Jin Jiang hotels in the Shanghai area, and this chain is a &quot;Chinese brand&quot; that went public sometime last year, I think. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Good location We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group. The rooms were okay-- the carpet in the rooms seemed a bit worn but not bad in cleanliness. Everything else was in clean and in order. It is not a 5 star hotel. 3 or 4 stars are more appropriate. Staff was excellent-- very good service and well trained. Internet worked fine. Location in the French Concession area was a plus for me. It had a feel like we were in a neighborhood where people actually lived. The taxi to places of interest is very cheap (11 Renmenbi to the Bund). Be aware that taxis can be hard to get in some places, like the Old City area, during rush hour. We had a free breakfast coupon as part of the tour package. The breakfast buffet at the top (a revolving restaurant) was excellent with chinese and western food choices. We had one night not part of the tour and the charge for breakfast was about 170 Renmenbi. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Convenient and great breakfast Although we had wanted to stay closer to the Bund and old city, we had trouble getting in because we were in Shanghai at the beginning of the National Day week. This hotel was still conveniently located and taxis to the museums or other locations in western Shanghai were only a couple of dollars. The lobby is nice, people polite, most of the staff at the desk and concierge spoke english well. Bell staff promptly obtained taxis and we never had any difficulty with them communicating with the taxi drivers about where we wanted to go. The breakfast is a huge buffet on the 41st floor, which is a rotating restaurant. Most days were sunny and the view was incredible. All in our party enjoyed the food, there was a lot of variety and it was good. You could have eggs cooked to order, asian food (great vegetables!), fruit, cereal, meats, just about anything you could think of. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the coffee was, and my tea loving friends liked the tea. The only issue at all was it could be quite cool in the restaurant, so we and the food would get cold.My issue with the hotel was the lack of cleanliness of the rooms. The bathrooms were ok, minor problems with the grout, but the carpets are filthy. I don't think they know what a vacuum is, the carpet never appeared to have been swept during our stay, and I venture has never been steam cleaned. Thank goodness for the complimentary slippers, I wore them at all times. The beds were very comfortable and other linens were clean. The drapes were dirty too.My husband used the gym and spa a few times, including the whirlpool and foot massage, and gave it good marks. One little tip, and perhaps those of you who travel more already know this, but I couldn't figure out how to turn the lights on at first...in the couple of Chinese hotels we stayed in, there is a small slot near the door where you have to insert your key card, and that activates the electricity in the room. If you didn't know this, I just saved you a few minutes of fumbling in the dark, as the doorman didn't tell me. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"$7.00 cup of coffee!! After a long day of traveling, I arrived at the JinJiang Tower. We had to use the side door, since the lobby was under construction, and the front entrance was all closed off. My booking was arranged via a business collegue in Shanghai who lives their, so I would have thought I got a good deal. But after my arriving home, and reading some of the posts here, I paid to much. Did not get breakfast, and the room was so-so.What really urked me was the price of the cup of coffee in the lobby, 55RMB, that is that is almost US$7.00 I almost flipped! In China??? A beer on the top floor is actually cheaper.From a location point of view it is a reasonably nice location. But taxi's are reasonable, so everything can be close by. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Not Recommended... Arriving from an amazing time at the MO in KL, we had high expectations. Unfortunately, this so-called 5* hotel was very poor. Firstly, hotel got booking wrong and gave us twin beds instead of double. They could not change us until the next day, not a good start. The rooms they gave us were not up to the standard of 5* hotels. The bathrooms were very small, there was only a plastic shower curtain above the bath tub to act as the shower and the toilet was in the way of the wash basin. If they want to keep their hotel as 5*, then they definitely need a complete overhaul of the rooms. Service was average with again much improvement needed. Even though we got a good rate for this hotel, we were extremely disappointed so after staying for 2 nights we changed to the Shangri-la in Pudong. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Decent Hotel I recently stayed at the Jin Jiang Tower for 2 nights. Shanghai is an amazing city.The Tower had an impressive lobby, but the rooms were a little dated. Everything was very clean but I agree with another post that it could use an update. I also found the staff in the restaurant and at the front desk to be a little curt. Also, the front desk closed during the night, which made it hard for myself and my group of jet lagged friends to get assistance or call other rooms. Most hotels I have stayed at have 24 hour front desk staff. Also, the elevators took FOREVER.The neighorhood was ok, there was a lot of shopping nearby (within a couple blocks). However, if I were to go back to Shanghai, I would prefer to stay closer to the Bund. Overall, I would probably not stay here again. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,"Loved the Jin Jiang The Jin JIang Tower is in the heart of the French Concession, and a cheap taxi ride to the Bund. Our room was clean and huge, the bathroom was a little dated, but for $135/night it was a great deal. The lobby was beautiful, although it did have a weird smell that fortunately didn't seem to escape anywhere else in the hotel. The best part about staying at the Jin Jiang was the free breakfasts in their rotating restaurant with beautiful views of the entire city. We would return here anytime. "
jin jiang tower hotel ,Would not stay at Jin Jiang Tower again The common facilites were good but our standard room and 2 others they tried to move us to were poorly maintained. The carpet was very dirty and worn. I would guess it had never been replaced and seldom cleaned. The bath was dirty and full of mildew and mold. A bottle of Tilex would have done wonders. It is a shame because the facility was really nice at one point and could be upgraded with minimum investment. It was our onlybad experience in hotels in China. Beijing and Xian hotels were very good

jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Very happy service We always travel, and stayed in many hotels, what I really liked was the very helpful and happy staff !! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fantastic View Two words, “Awesome View”. Given the amount of high rise buildings in Shanghai, the location of this tower had 360 degrees of unobstructed view of the city. Lobby starts on 38th floor and the rooms goes up to 60th floor.The room was typical Marriott sized and nicely furnished. Because of extensive food choices around Shanghai, we did not use any of the hotel's restaurants. Having read about all the constructions around the Bund in preparation for 2010 Expo, we were glad we did not chose any hotel near the Bund as it was under construction 24 hours. JW Marriott is centrally located on Nanjing Road West within walking distance to Nanjing Road East, where all the shops are located. The only disappointment was the Tomorrow Square, it turns out not to be a shopping area, but one giant restaurant. Overall, I would recommend the JW Marriott in Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great hotel convenient location We had a great stay - the hotel is very convenient to the subway, which was ideal for us to get around the city quickly. Concierge lounge was good - breakfast included congee, dumplings, selection of pastries, a couple hot dishes, cereals, fruit etc. It doesn't seem like a lot when you look around the room, but there is actually plenty of selection. Hors d'oevres were also good and many a time we would come to the CL for a snack and enjoy the view.Didn't have a chance to try the pool but it looked amazing!One caveat - we had a rollaway bed and my friend found the bed very hard. We asked for 2 extra duvets so she could sleep on top of them - I'm sure housekeeping was very puzzled but we did get them promptly when requested : ) If you need a rollaway, you may wish to reconsider and just get another room. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Highly Recommend this Property Stayed at the hotel for one evening - a Saturday evening - excellent rate. Had not visited shanghai before. simple to get to from the Airport. MagLev train (at 431 KM/hr) to the Metro station - Green Line - several stops to People's Square (4 RMB fare.) Exit the station at Exit #11 (there are close to 20 exits!) and the hotel was right in front of me.I had emailed the Concierge ahead of my arrival to have the travel desk get me a first class train ticket to Suzhou for the following evening. I recieved a call in my room a little after my check in to let me know that the ticked was waiting for me at the travel desk.Did not pay to vist the Lounge on the top floor - did however purchase the breakfast for the following morning. Excellent deal - view.The Nanjing Road is quite an experience for those who have not done it before. Traveling alone and walking the route late in the evening (past the Radisson Hotel) I was approached by more than one lady interested in &quot;having a coffee&quot; with me. Declined gracefully. did follow one individual down a side street to buy a couple of rolex Watches for 140 RMB each. Originally offerred to me at 2000 RMB!.Sad to discover that the real place to shop[ is 580 Nanjing Road - the other direction - towards the center of Shanghai - only about a couple of blocks from the Hotel.Would highly recommend this dictinctive property. Returned for afternoon tea in the 38th floor Lobby at 4.30 PM on my last day in China - the light show on the taller buildings starts at 5 PM. Tea and bread &amp; butter pudding - excellent and not expensive for the view/service. Stop by for tea even if you are not staying in the Hotel.Would highly recommend this property. 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Somewhat dated and overhyped On first arrival, we were impressed with the view etc.. but next time I would try another property. First, the overall staff attitude was not as friendly as in other hotels we stayed in China. A purchase of three small bottles of evian water was close to $25 U.S. My room on the 45th floor had an impressive view (if you could see through the air pollution), was nicely decorated, quiet, comfortable, although somewhat dated (picture tube tv). The location, next to Tomorrow Square, was really not an advantage. Shopping on the nearby main shopping street , Nanjing Rd. was annoying with countless people hawking watches, massages, etc.. Go elsewhere in Shanghai for shopping. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Perfect place to stay in shanghai I loved this hotel, it had a near perfect location, close to tomorrows square(where you have to go in the morning to see the locals do their workout), and not to far away from the shopping street. Great concignere who were very helpfull recommending places(everything from what to see, party, eat and shop). The hotell lobby is in the 38th floor which makes it spectacular. I stayed in a regular room which had good space, a ver nice bathroom and a great view. The excutive floor deal was also very nice, free flow of wine, snacks, breakfast(either continental or american) which tasted superb. The facilities at the hotel in general was top notch, the only drawback was no wireless in the our room. We also stayed at a different hotel in the french quarter which was really nice too but, it was felt kinda far away, and kinda &quot;used&quot; even though everything was clean and nice. I'd difinitly recommend the jw mariott for all travelers, leisure or business stay it should be perfect. And there was also always cabs ready outside wihich was helpfull. Just tell the staff outside the hotel to tell the taxi drivers where we'd like to go. we had to use to taxis and they told the cabs to go to the exact same spot which made all the logistics alot eaiser. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fabulous Location and Service We arrived in Shanghai a few days before meeting up with a scheduled GAP tour of China. This hotel is not only really well located, but it also provides friendly, attentive service, extremely comfortable beds and a level of cleanliness not found in many low budget travel hotels in China. Sadly, we only stayed at the JW Marriott two days, and then had to join our tour group in a horrible hotel two blocks away. We would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Nice- But plan on a lot of Elevator time I stayed here in September and at a rate of 1980 + 300 tax ( approx 370 USD) a night it was about what should be expected. The hotel is modern and the rooms are comfortable. Check -in was efficient and the staff is very friendly ( although not always knowledgeable) Housekeeping does an excellent job both in the daily cleaning and the evening re-fresh. The gym is a decent size, but they keep it very warm so workouts can be uncomfortable. I booked a meeting room on the top floor. When my group arrived, I found that there was no electricity and the projector didn’t work. The staff seemed completely flustered and had no idea what to do. I eventually found an alternative room and told them I was moving. The lobby is on the 38th floor and requires a transfer to another bank of elevators to get to your room. Getting to the gym requires yet another set of elevators. Communication can be an issue. I asked the concierge to make a reservation for me and provide the address to the cab driver. He made the reservation at one location and gave the driver the address for another location. There is a vegetarian restaurant less than 50 meters from the front door (make a left) that’s excellent. They attempt to mimic various meats and do a good job. Continue down that same street to the shopping mall – you’ll find some amazing prices on bags, clothing and watches. Stay away from the buffet off the hotel lobby, its WAY overpriced, it looks like a Dennys and the food quality is average at best. The gelato sold in the lobby is pretty good. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"smells awesome The lobby has such a refreshing smell after a long day in Shanghai. Excellent service in excellent location in Shanghai. Our taxi driver dropped us off at the service rear entrance which made for a less than auspicious beginning but as soon as the staff saw us, they whisked our bags away and were terribly attentive. My husband is a gold Marriott member so they upgraded us to a Jr. Ste on something near the 46th floor, I don't remember exactly. The room was great, the view amazing. I never heard another soul when we were in our room. The breakfast had plenty of choices from East to West and the seafood was terrific at breakfast. The bar had nice cocktails with a view and their service was flawless. I would not hesitate to return. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Phenominal Service Room Location Food The service at this Marriot was superb. If I made eye contact with any of the staff, they immediately responded, asking if I needed anything. At one point, I needed to go to a pharmacy to get some medicine. They brought the Hotel Car with a driver and an English speaking Concierge to take me to the pharmacy, help me obtain what I needed and brought me back to the hotel.....at no charge. I've never had a hotel provide that level of service before. The rooms were great, beds very comfortable, bathrooms spotless. Food was excellent. Would not even think of staying in another place next time I am in Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"No better place to stay in Shanghai Everything about this hotel screams luxury, especially the attentiveness of the staff. The service is incredible. At times it seems that the staff outnumber the guests. There is nothing they won't do for a guest. The room prices are reasonable, given that it is a high end hotel in a major city. It's hard to find a better value anywhere. The rooms are on floors 40-58 and all have spectacular views of the city. Prices in the cocktail lounges and restaurants are a bit pricey, however, because you pay for the views. It's worth it. The hotel is centrally located and close to Nanjing Rd. shopping and the Bund. It's just across from People's Square and the major art museum. It's an easy cab ride to the Pudong business and financial district, and most of the major tourist attractions. You simply mist stay here when in Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Another Great Stay at the JW Marriott Second time at this hotel. Really enjoyed this stay as well. They upgraded us to a corner room that had a large sitting area in addition to the bedroom area. The Concierge lounge on the 59th floor is nice. Evening snacks were OK, not great. As a Platinum, could have breakfast in the lounge or the restaurant. Chose the restaurant as it had a nicer buffet - but had coffee each morning in the lounge. Not very busy up there.The hotel's location is perfect - with shopping (580 Nanjing Road West market) just steps away plus the main walking street and the Bund all within a reasonable walk. As always, when traveling to China - make sure you have your hotel name and address written in the local language as the cab drivers seem to have no clue otherwise. Even with that - they can get lost very easily. For dinner - 1221 was awesome. Have the Shanghai noodles. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"fantastic hotel- one of marriott's best great location superb people This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in for a long time. It is one of the few in the world I would recommend to anyone and would def go back to if in Shanghai again. Location is smack bang in the middle of Shanghai (and not on the busy, traffic ridden Pudong side where some hotels are eg Hyatt.. avoid as a nightmare zone currently- as is the Bund area as construction going on for next year's world expo ruining one of the only nice parts of Shanghai for the time being...)I was albeit upgraded to the top (59th) floor with access to the exec lounge (gold card holder which helps). The room had the most amazing views (altho of one of my least favourite cities in the world...) and was very well designed with a coffee machine and other niceties. Large, comfortable, great bathroom. The exec lounge (along with that of J W Marriott Beijing) is also one of the best of any Marriott. Fantastic selection of food and drink (which will save you a lot as wine etc is not cheap in this city) and computers to get internet access. Worth paying to get access as you can have breakfast and probably enough to eat and drink in the evenings- so it pays for itself. Plus continual fresh fruit juices, coffees etc during the day... If you do venture to the 38th floor restaurant (also the lobby floor) for breakfast- a fabulous selection and excellent service. There are other restaurants in the hotel- including a chinese one and an American one (given the number of American business people in the hotel- prob popular) but a huge amount outside as well.The concierge desk is staffed by excellent and helpful people. As is the reception. They are also friendly.There is a pricey Mandara spa in the hotel- but offering promotions as obviously not getting enough business. It is good but average. Even with promos- expensive for what it is. The hotel is one of the few having an outside pool- nothing too spectacular but by China standards where most pools are inside it is good and if the weather is ok and not mega polluted (a few days of the year?) good for a quick swim or sunbathe.My tip? Shanghai is not a great place to go to- and if going as a tourist- not a huge amount to see. You can easily do everything in Shanghai of interest in less than a day, then the garden/canal areas for a day trip outside? So despite the fantastic hotel- I would not recommend staying too long in this soul-less polluted city.... "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Wow! This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in China, if not all of Asia. It is absolutely beautiful, modern yet traditional, and the staff are could not help you more if they tried. Check-in is quick and efficient. The last time I stayed, I left some cosmetics in my room, which housekeeping kept for 3 months for me until I returned. I have had so much help with everything I asked for, from booking train tickets to borrowing an umbrella.The breakfast has an overwhelming choice: fresh fruit smoothies, waffles or eggs made/cooked in front of you, and a baffling array of pastries, juices, dimsum, cereals that caters to practically every taste and diet possible.The gym is really well equipped with sufficient amounts of weights and cardio machines, a fabulous indoor pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam rooms that it is almost rude not to use it.The bathroom is great with a massage shower and plenty of products. The bed is so comfortable - beyond description.This hotel was in a great location for work, but with plenty to do after hours as well. It is pricey, but the facilities, staff and location make this worthwhile, and make me want to stay for far longer than 3 nights. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great hotel - close to ""real"" and ""knock off"" shopping The JW Marriott Shanghai has been and continues to be a hotel that I appreciate and love for the quite, clean rooms and great service. Located on the busy Nanjing West Road (Nanjing Xi Lu), this 60 story hotel/apartment complex is close to where I need to be as well as shopping (and knock off shopping – read below), and sights in Shanghai (the Bund is only about 10 minutes away by Taxi). If you are going to Shanghai for business, you might want to pick a hotel close to your offices as you can (and likely will) spend a lot of (lost) time in taxis given the traffic. Check in is on floor 38, the hotel itself is 60 floors total. If you happen to be Marriott Gold or Platinum, the executive lounge is on 59 and has some great views. One minor point is that they don’t allow you to have a guest on the executive lounge without paying extra. The hotel has nice rooms, a good bed, and high quality service that one can come to expect in South East Asia. The service level at this hotel is quite high – and is very consistent throughout all the floors and functions. Restaurants in Hotel: The breakfast (if included in your rate or if you are Gold/Platinum) is well stocked, has a wide variety of foods and is quite good. However, for 190 RMB ($28 USD) I don’t find it a good value, and have found it to be far too expensive for my tastes. The restaurant in the hotel is similar, good food but at a price that can easily be beat by just going down to the street and getting a recommendation from the staff. Getting To Hotel: Getting to the hotel from the airport is about a 150 RMB taxi ride, or if you are “rich” you can schedule a pick up in an Audi A6 via the hotel itself for a mere 690 RMB. China is unusually safe as a country, and I recommend the local taxi for the lower rate (even for first time travelers to China) assuming that there is some degree of adventure/interest. Before you travel, print out the hotel you are going to from the web, or alternatively, after you land, there are desks in the arrival lobby after your baggage claim and you can have someone write your hotel in Chinese (just in case your taxi driver doesn’t understand English). It takes about 50 minutes, depending on the traffic. Getting to Hotel – Maglev (magnetic levitation train) . As an alternative, (and if you have never done this before – you should) you can take the Shanghai Maglev Train from the Airport to Long Yang Road station. The Maglev train runs about every 15 minutes from the airport, and travels at speeds up to 430 KPH (250 miles per hour – top speed varies somewhat by time of day). It takes about 6 to 8 minutes to go from the airport to Long Yang Road station, and then about another 20 to 30 minutes by taxi (about 50 RMB for taxi) from there to the hotel. Cost of the train is 40 RMB (posted as 50 RMB, not sure why it was 40 RMB), and is well worth the tourist experience. About half way between the airport and the station, you will pass the Maglev train going in the other direction and it sounds a bit like a sonic boom. Eating Out - I have looked for local restaurants late at night after arriving at the hotel. On my prior visits, I left the exit going right, and circled the block taking right hand turns. Of course, there is a McDonalds directly across the street, but who goes to China for McDonalds? This time, I exited LEFT out of the main exit, crossed Nanjing West Road, then turned slightly to the Right. Just past the Porsche dealership/showroom, take the first street to the LEFT. Go one block, and you will find a number of restaurants open to 2AM (this is at most a 5 minute walk). I ate in two different ones, and you can get a great meal for a fraction of what the Marriott will charge on the 40th floor. A bit of caution as these restaurants seem to function mostly in Chinese (marginal English) although they did have menus with photographs and it is fun to try out your Chinese skills. I enjoyed the food here over the more sterile (yes, perhaps a double entendre) restaurants in the Marriott. I recommend this experience for those with a bit of adventure, or those not wanting to eat inside of the hotel – your wallet will thank you and you will have stories to tell when you go home. Knock Off Shopping: For those of you that remember the good old days of Xiangyang (Xiang Yang) market off of Huaihai road, it was closed by the government in June of 2006. For those of you familiar with this open air market, it was where you could find anything, and everything that was fake or a knock off. If you are looking for a taste of Xiangyang market, and don’t mind the hassles of negotiation (buyer beware – negotiate hard …. And I mean really hard) there is a smaller version of Xiangyang just down the street from the JW Marriott. Go Left out of the front door, go Left on Nanjing West Road, and go about 5 minutes to the bridge (there is a police station on the corner). Go another 2 minutes and on your right hand side will be a 4 story building located at 580 Nanjing West Road – which contains a small, yet lively version of the Xiangyang market. 580 Nanjing Xi Lu -- Beware – and fair warning – everything in this building is fake…..everything. It might look real, and the label might say 100% real – but it isn’t. But for those seeking DVDs, Watches (Rolex, Tag, you name it), North Face, Caloway Golf Clubs, Polo shirts, Crocs, Purses (you name the brand) or anything else with a brand name—here it is. There is also some local souvenir products sold in the building if you are just looking for gifts. To say that the vendors are “aggressive”, and that you had better negotiate hard is a huge (HUGE) understatement. To give you some examples, there are “wine holders” which look like Chinese outfits or bags --- starting prices are somewhere between 45 to 65 RMB….I bought them for 5 RMB – yes, less than 1/10th of the starting asking price. Fake pashmina that start at 145 RMB can be had for 15 to 20 RMB. Fake Rolex watches – starting at 600 to 1000 RMB were sold for 110 RMB. A pair of Crocs went for 50 RMB. DVDs are still running about $1USD (7-8 RMB) if you bargain hard. For those of you that start at ½ of the price, vendors expect this, and they make a killing. I highly recommend that you try multiple booths for general pricing before you start buying – walking away will get you a price “shouted” at you so that you can have some guess as to the “real” price. Note that in all fairness, if you toss a price out, and they meet it, you should honor your offer – so be careful putting out what you might consider a “low ball” offer might end up with you “overpaying”. Trust me when I tell you that even at these prices – the vendors are making money. I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past as well as at the Ritz up the road. At a rate of approximately 1300 RMB or about $195 USD per night, this hotel delivers a consistent product that has solid value. As the rate escalates (in my opinion over 2000+ RMB), or depending on what you pay, the value proposition can shift significantly and there are plenty of hotels in Shanghai to consider on a value basis. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Solid business hotel good location Have stayed at JW Marriott on business trips four times in past three months. Location is excellent; most taxi drivers know it or at a pinch you can draw a picture of the rocket shaped building and show them that! I like strolling around the park across the street in the morning before business meetings. Rooms are nice with all the usual five star conveniences. Beds are comfy with handy reading lights. In room internet is RMB 50 per day but works fine. The Chinese restaurant is very good. Local Shanghaiese friends said the dim sum is one of the best among the major hotel restaurants. The cigar bar is merely ok. Room service breakfast is pretty average too.Only real negative is that is pretty hard to get cell phone reception in your room if you are on the upper floors; you may have to go down to the lobby to use your phone or Blackberry.Overall this a good choice for international businessperson or travelers who want five star amenities. 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Stunning property and great service!!! I stayed at the JW Marriott Shanghai with my husband and 5 month old baby and received fabulous service from the entire team whilst enjoying stunning accommodation. This hotel really is perfectly located to all the things you must see in Shanghai - we will be back 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"5* - nothing more to say really We stayed at this hotel on Marriott points. Despite this we were upgraded to a room on the Executive floors (although without the associated privileges). Neither my wife or I could really fault the hotel. The check-in was excellent and the room very comfortable with great views over Tomorrows Square. The location is superb if you want to be at the heart of downtown Shanghai.Didn't really use the hotel facilities other than the swimming pool (the indoor one is a bit boring/bland but otherwise excellent and it is probably a lot nicer in the summer when the outdoor pools are open as well) and the gym. The gym was spacious and airy with lots of well maintained modern kit. No charge for the pool or gym.Didn't use the in-room interent (for which there was a charge) but did use the Blackberry on the free wifi in the lobby and it worked well for email and web browsing and even checking-in online.Right across the street within a couple of minutes walk are plenty of food outlets for breakfast and the Tomorrow Square tube line is only a couple of minutes walk. If you are going to this hotel take the Maglev in from the airport (50 RMB and 300 kmph) and then get on the tube - you can't go wrong its all in English - for a quick, cheap and interesting way to get to the hotel.We would stay again in a flash. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"nice business style hotel Relying a bit on the memory banks for this one, was your typical 5 star style business hotel. The reception was actually half way up the highrise which made for good views. The breakfast was very good. Service was professional and courteous. Location was very good near the main street that leads all the way down to the bund. A moderate walk to the xintindi (sp?) restaurant area. Plush hotel but like any other jw marriott. Shanghai was good fun, like a large HK but I prefer Beijing for a piece of China "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great Hotel - have stayed here MANY times. Best place in Shanghai. I have stayed at many of the executive level hotels in the shanghai area and this is the one I choose to go back to. First of all, location of your hotel is VERY important in shanghai due to their horrendous traffic problems. This hotel is well located for both business and pleasure. The lobby of this hotel starts on the 38th floor of a nice building. I like that because when you go to your hotel after a long day in the chaos of shanghai, it feels like you are really going up and away. then from the lobby level, you go to another set of elevators that take you to the rooms. The rooms are very nice, marble baths, awesome comfortable beds (which is a huge plus in china). The standard rooms are small, I always book a room up a level or 2 from standard and they get more spacious. The corner rooms are nice with all the windows overlooking the city. Only thing the room doesn't have is a flat screen tv, it's just a standard tv. That would seriously be my only complaint. They have a nice choice of restaurants, but with such a good location i rarely eat in the hotel - i walk to something nearby. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Mediocre Hotel in Shanghai This was the last stop on my China trip and while the aesthetics of this hotel are great the staff is mediocre at best. Great location in the city, but don't trust the concierges' and be aware that though most of the staff you see is fluent in English the phone operators are not necessarily able to comprehend as well as they speak which means they can screw up appointments and general information. The Mandara Spa, which provides a great service, ticked me off in that they advertise a special all over the hotel that they cannot provide because &quot;they don't have the products&quot;; well hey then take down the signs that advertise the special. I went to Le Meridian to check out their spa and actually got better info on sites and shows from their concierge staff than at the JW. Overall not up to JW standard.PS: Don't go with the hotel offer of using their van to the airport, just budget time and go with a metered cab, gteed it will be cheaper. A great alternative I used, catch the Maglev train it takes 8 minutes from the Longyang Road station in Pudong. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Loved the JW Marriott Tomorrow Square The JW Marriott in Shanghai was truly wonderful. We had two rooms for the four of us on a club floor. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable, with really nice bathrooms. There were celadon green porcelain accessories, very pretty, and an artful spray of fresh flowers every day. (I especially appreciated that there were lots of places to put things) The club room was nice, with a variety of seating choices and outlets for laptops at most of them. The view from the club lounge on the 59th floor is a wonderful view of People's Square and the Shanghai skyline. The breakfast on the club floor was OK, sometimes a bit odd (we found out on our last day that they would do custom eggs for you, but we were never told this in our 5 night stay). The staff dismantle the breakfast, snacks etc. militantly at the time appointed. If you came for breakfast even 1 minute late, you would be out of luck. The snacks and wines were very good. The club floor privilege comes with FREE LAUNDRY. This is HUGE and probably saved us hundreds, we were able to leave with everything clean. The lobby in this hotel is on 38, then you have to take another elevator to your room, sometimes seemed a hassle. The California Grill restaurant was excellent, as was the Chinese restaurant. The location is a short cab ride to the Bund and across from People's Square which includes the Shanghai Museum (wonderful!) and other sights. There is an indoor/outdoor pool which was attractive and a nice place to sit and/or swim. The staff were very helpful in arranging transportation (with four people we usually needed a minivan) and one day arranged a guide for us on very short notice to tour the French Concession. The guide and driver were very good.All in all this hotel was a welcome, luxurious respite at the end of each hot sticky sweaty day of sightseeing. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Stunning builiding decent room Not JW-level service JW is the title given to the top Marriott hotels so I was expecting a top notch experience.As the taxi pulls up to the curb-side, we were offered help from the bellboys to take our luggage but as the other half of our party was lost in the traffic from the airport to the hotel, we decided to wait in the downstair waiting area. When our other party arrived, we took the elevator to the lobby on the 38th floor. While there was no other guests at the counter, we were left at the counter for 30 seconds while the agents were either doing some works while others were chatting to each other and did not pay attention to me. When one of then finally comes around, there were no welcome greetings. This lack of greeting is something that I have not seen in any JW before. The rest of the checkin was quick although our passports was photocopied. I have not seen this at any other highend hotel in China. I was offered the exec lounge priviledges for 600 Yuan/day. Since I do not plan to be all day in the hotel, I declined the offer.To get to our room, we took another ride from the lobby to the 44th floor. The room is furnished in cherry wood color which is pleasing on the eyes. The twin beds are comfortable and soft. A work desk chair and TV/mini-safe occupied the opposite side of the beds. The TV is an old tube-type, not something that I would expect in a 5-stars hotel and the least for a JW. The wall to wall windows offer a stunning view the tomorrow-square park. Although the view to the Pudong side was partially block by the Meridien and the Capital Land buildings accross the park. The marble bathroom was roomy with good amenities. The bathtub also have water jets which please my other-half. The standing shower is also very lovely and water pressure was decent.The location of the JW-Marriott is outstanding. Within a few blocks of the most well-known shopping street in Shanghai and with the subway station accross the street, you can get anywhere in Shanghai efficiently. The Bund is a 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel.If this was any other than a JW, it would have been a fine hotel but what has been separating a run-of-the-mill Marriott from a JW has always been the service. This hotel does not deserve the moniker of JW. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"No stone left unturned. SENSATIONAL. Perfect in every imaginable way. We were upgraded to a junior suite with sensational views. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable. Everything that you might need was provided - including a small gift (teapot) to take home! What a wonderful room. In terms of the amenities, the pool was awesome as too was the restaurant. Breakfast included exemplary homemade sausages, espresso coffee and freshly squeezed juices. Superbly done - and everything was PIPING HOT! This is because they only offer the food in small quantities - thus ensuring it's freshness and hot temperature. WOW factor in every way at this hotel. The management and staff deserve nothing but praise. THANK YOU so much - and a special thanks for the upgrade to accommodate our 2 young children comfortably. Noted AND certainly appreciated. Would recommend this place without any doubt whatsoever. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Terrific service This is one of my corporate hotel in Shanghai. Loved the location where it is near to everything. Train station is like 5-10mins walk away. Within walking distance to major shopping malls &amp; food. Fantastic view from room where you get to see the city view even there's no smog.After a long day at work, the best place is to R&amp;R at the lounge and enjoy the city view. The staff are all very polite &amp; helpful especially when I'm getting advice where to go for the night out.However.... the only thing I hate is to take lift from lobby to 38th floor to change another elevator to my hotel room. Is just irritating if you are in a rush. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Superb apartments luxurious facilities and service of the highest kind I stayed for a month at the serviced aparments at the JW Marriott at Tomorrow Square in Shanghai and the experience is second to none. The building is incredible and stands out in the congested and illuminated Shanghai skyline, which makes you feel you're staying somewhere special. The first 30 or so floors are apartments and the 30 floors above it are the hotel rooms.I stayed in a studio which, though could be larger, was luxurious and comforable. The main part of the room comprises a giant bed with a matress about a foot thick which means one can simply hit the bed and fall alseep straight away. The main area also has a sofa and TV area and also a little dining table. One side of the room is nothing but a giant floor to ceiling window with incredible views of Shanghai. The furniture is expensive and the hotel takes no short cuts here. The kitchen is small but fully equipped with a fitted kitchen, oven, cooker, washing machine, dish washer, extractor hood, sink, large fridge/freezer and comes with all cooking utensils, pans, cups, glasses, plates, bowls, tea, coffee, sugar, milk etc. Never really usd the kitchen though as there are so many places to eat out.The bathroom is very nice, with good lighting, Kohler bath, walk in shower with two side jet streams of water as well as a powerful main shower hose. The bathroom is fully equipped and restocked for free with shampoo, soap, fresh luxury towels, fresh bathrobes etc.When I arrived there were a complimentary bottles of wine, quite a lot of free beer in the fridge and some snacks. All for fee. There's no mini bar as such in the apartments.As an apartment resident you get to use all the hotel facilities and you get 25% off all room service, at the shops etc. The gym is free and good. The two pools (one inside and one outside) are great, as is the sauna and the steam room, again all part of the price. The food at the restaurants (which also do room service) are some of the nicest food you will have, very fresh and you can tell it came straight out of the pan and delivered to your room.The lifts are excellent and very efficient and the service is always of the highest order with excellent english speaking staff. After a few weeks the staff know you by name which also impressed me.The food court on the ground floor sells good quality western meals such as lasagne, sandwiches, pizzas, sweets, cakes, wine and beer as well as western magazines and english newspapers.The Mandara Spa is a luxurious addition to the hotel providing massage and spa facilities in beautiful relaxing and authentic surroundings. Probably one of the best massage spas in East Asia though you have to pay for this. A good hairdresser here too. A haircut costs 130 RMB.Location wise, it is right bang in the middle of the best part of Shanghai. The affluence of the area is illustrated by the Ferrari and Maserati showrooms adjacent to the hotel and a Porsche and Mercedes showroom directly opposite.Though expensive, (it cost 28000 RMB for the month, that's over 4000 US dollars), it will be money well spent if you can afford it. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Good business hotel in a great location The JW Marriott is a fine hotel. As a business hotel, it is hard to differentiate itself from the mass of business hotels in Shanghai, so what makes it stand out...?1. The location at Tomorrow's Square is great. You couldn't ask for somewhere more central, or with better access to Shanghai. 2. The views are great (if there is no smog). Reception is on the 38th floor and guest rooms are upwards of the 40th floor. 3. The showers have 3 heads for a massage at the end of a long day.4. The executive lounge is large and comfortable, and offers a good selection of food &amp; drinks.The restaurants are good (but not great) - standard for a hotel of this calibre. The meeting rooms are good and notably, the air-conditioning works properly and holds a temperature.Two very small criticism; (1) Whatever produce is in season... is in every dish, every day! (2) Taking a lift from your room to the 38th floor &amp; then a separate lift from 38 to ground gets tedious after a few days. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Good location but not a-typical JW The location is good with the Shanghai Museum, People's Square and Xintiandi all within walking distance. After a marvellous experience at the JW in Beijing we anticipated similar service levels and room standards but it wasn't quite up to par. Decor in the room is very dark wood but there are plenty of windows to let in the light. Breakfast buffet is plentiful and dinner at Wan Hao was of good quality (although pricey as you would expect). Stanley Yin - Front of House Manager - was incredibly helpful and offered many tips on where to eat/drink in the city. Do get a cab and go to 'Face bar' for a relaxing drink in a Colonial atmosphere.Biggest let down at this hotel was staff standing there waiting with hand out for a tip for absolutely everything that they did for you. It seems that the hospitality that we had received in Beijing (that came with no expectations of financial reward from staff) was not in place here. Shame. I like to tip for good service rather than for a nod of the head. On the ground floor there is a small cafe that sells very good quality sandwiches, snacks and bottles of wine and cheaper than you will pay 38 floors up! Overall it was a good base, I would recommend it but it's not in the same league as other JW's I have stayed at. As long as you have that expectation in mind you won't be disappointed. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great Hotel and Location Easily found the hotel when we arrived into Shanghai, reception desk veryu friendly and efficient as only the chinese know how. Room on 48th Floor was very very comfortable with every amenity and that bed was sooo comfy. Restaurant staff hover when you're having your meal and distracts from the views and ambience I felt, but that may just be me. Concierge desk on ground floor very knowledgable but not forthcoming straight away with their 'add on fees' for their service - to be watched, but is expected I guess at hotels of the calibre. Overall a very comfortable and enjoyable stay, good location and within very easy walking distance to the metro lines and shopping areas and park close by. On the higher end of the scale as far as rates are concerned but this is a top hotel for which you are well looked after as a honoured guest. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"going downhill I have stayed here regularly for the past 3-4 years, usually 4-5 times per year, so I know it very well, but recently I notice a decline in my satisfaction with each stay. Here is why I say that:1) Room temperature- I prefer it fairly warm, but my last few stays I notice the room is cooler than the hallways and the control in the room does not work. I always have to call to complain, then they send an engineer who comes to measure the temperature and informs me he can manually increase the temperature. So what is the purpose of the in-room control??!!2) Internet service- this past week it was absolutely terrible- both in my room and in the executive lounge.3) Food- in November I ate in the executive lounge the night before leaving and got food poisoning.4. Gym- it's a nice gym, but there is recently there is hardly anyone monitoring the actual gym and only the person at the front desk near the elevator. Also, there used to be a fruit bowl on the front desk, now I have to ask for it.Time to reconsider where I'll stay in Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Average rooms and service One of three hotels during stay in Shanghai. It ranked number 3 after Shangri-la Pudong and Radisson New World. The rooms are very average Marriott, not befitting of a JW. Even the junior suites were not impressive. Drab green carpet and unimaginative decor.Would not return to this hotel with better choices out there. The family suite at the Radisson New World was twice the size and much more modern for the same price. This place does not hold a candle to the Shangri-la Pudong! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Great Hotel - Business Trip I have stayed at this hotel several times and will continue to several times a year while in Shanghai for business. This hotel is in the heart of the downtown area. Very nice and upscale. Beautiful views of the city from the top floors. Service always good. Laundrey service good. The gym has a good view of the city as well. Would highly recommend to any traveler in the Shanghai area. 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Simply a great hotel ! I just completed a 2 week stay in the Executive Apartments in this hotel. The entire experience as described in other posts here was excellent ! The room was simply perfect. Spacious, well appointed, comfortable, and had excellent views of the city. The staff at this hotel is the most responsive of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Any request was responded to almost instantly. They went out of their way make sure I was comfortable. Room service was fast, accurate, and the food was excellent. The room service menu, is a little limiting, but there are many other choices in this hotel including several excellent restaurants, and a concession stand in the lobby that sells pre-made meals. Its a great location and near many businesses and local attractions. The internet service in the hotel was also excellent which is not always the case in China. A total five star experience. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"JW Marriott -- Again Terrific I just returned from 5 days at the JW Marriott in Shanghai. This, my 4th stay at this hotel in the past 2 years, confirms my view that the JW Marriott deserves very top grades. Rooms (and views) are terrific. Location is marvelous (in contrast to the Four Seasons), on Nanjing Road, walking distance to the Bund, near two subway lines, 10-minutes walk to Xintiandi and otherwise centrally-placed (unless, of course, you are doing business in Pudong, an area that offers its own great hotels). The Marriott has been well-maintained and shines; its three restaurants offer terrific food; staff is knowledgeable, accommodating and friendly. The Executive Floor Lounge is spacious, comfortable and offers free internet access. With its “JW” brand, Marriott has been attempting to pierce the top echelon of international hotels; with its Shanghai property, it succeeds. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Most awesome hotel I've very stayed at!!! The JW Marriot at Tomorrow Square is hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed at! We stayed there for 4 nights in November during our visit to Shanghai. Since I am a Platinum member with Marriot, my family and I were greeted with a personal assistant who checked us in and escorted us to our rooms to ensure we were satisfied with everything. We were also greeted in our room with an exquisite bowl of fruit and beautifully packaged truffles. Although the rooms are a bit on the small side, the beds were so overwhelmingly comfortable, it was hard to get up in the mornings. We also had a wonderful view from the 49th floor of our hotel room. I was additionally impressed with the Excecutive Lounge which was nice and airy and provided a great array of snacks and beverages throughout the day as well as complimentary internet access. The Executive Lounge assistant was very nice and offered so many invaluable recommendations for shopping and restaurants nearby. It was also cool that they have the highest library in the world (according to the Guinness World Record 2006), so it was interesting to check out!Lastly, I have to recommend the Mandara Spa located in the hotel. This was one of the most beautiful spas I've ever been to. My sister and I each had 2 treatments which totaled approximately $100 each...what a deal!! Also, as hotel guests, you get an additional 10% off. We had a private suite for our treatments which was so spacious (with private bathroom) and beautifully decorated. The aestheticians were wonderful as they kept conservations with you to an absolute minimum so you could peacefully enjoy the treatments.Overall, the location, price and service was impeccable at this hotel! I plan to stay here every time I return to Shanghai! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed At Think of the 38th floor lobby as an added safety feature for residents of the JW Marriott. You're well insulated from random solicitations that constantly go on along Nanjing Rd yet you're a stroll away if you desire to experience it. You're close to the Ren Ming subway station and while hailing a taxi can prove to be difficult in Shanghai, the taxi stand constantly has taxis waiting outside the 1st floor lobby. Being a Platinum member, I was upgraded to a 55th floor executive level room with a room facing the Bund. There are fresh fruit, a box of chocolate truffles, bottles of water, and varied selection of teas waiting for you in the room. TV channels include CNN, ESPN, CNBC, MTV, HBO, Showtime, and Starz in English. The bathroom has both a shower and a bathtub. The Executive Lounge on the 59th floor provides all you can drink top shelf liquor as well as sodas, water, coffee, tea, juices, milk, breakfast, late afternoon hors-d'oeuvres, and evening desserts everyday including weekends. The full service gym provides iPods while you workout and has everything an American could want with free weights, cross trainers, and treadmills. The 7th floor pool is an oasis in the urban Shanghai jungle with indoor and outdoor pools for laps and recreation. All in all the JW Marriott is well worth the 2500 RMB price tag and outshines any other hotel I've stayed at. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fantastic hotel This is Marriott at it's best- when we got there we were so happy about staying at at Marriott property. The lobby is on the 38th floor and our room was on the 54th floor which had amazing views. The room was a little on the small side, but in Shanghai you don't really need to spend much time indoors. There are so many things next to the hotel that you pay for the views &amp; location. The pool &amp; spa were a little tricky to find, but they provide an oasis in the city to relax &amp; swim in Shanghai's heat. Also the staff at the restaurant were very attentive. Tip in Shanghai: Take the Metro to cross the river costs 2 yuan rather than the silly tourist tunnel that costs 35. Go for dinner at Xintiandi- really nice restaurants and try Shanghainese food which is sweeter than the rest of chinese food. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fine hotel in a great location Although this hotel is clearly aimed at business travelers, we stayed as tourists and really enjoyed it. As everyone has noted, this is truly a first-class hotel with stunning views from the lobby and the rooms. We used miles to stay here, and as a result didn't have a view towards the river. Still, no complaints. Lovely room on the 51st floor...elegantly designed, with a big, luxurious bathroom.Also, for tourists, it should be noted that the location is excellent. It's a hop, skip and jump from the Shanghai Museum, which is in the running for the best museum in the country, and from Nanjing Lu, the pedestrianized main shopping street. A 20-minute walk down Nanjing Lu takes you to the Bund. We didn't make it to the French Concession, but it's a short walk from the hotel in the opposite direction. As a slight complaint, I wanted to echo the point made by an earlier reviewer about the service: although they were efficient and courteous, they were not proactive in any way. For a hotel that strives to be one of the very best, this was a disappointment. Upon our arrival, we asked for a restaurant recommendation. They only one they would offer was the hotel's restaurant. Not very helpful. Other than that, excellent stay. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"find the Indian chef ! We have returned to our home in Tasmania after a magical tour around the world. The Marriott hotels rarely let us down and here in Shanghai was no exception. The staff were polite and always helpful, our room was perfect and spacious especially as we were given an upgrade on arrival. Most memorable was the Indian chef at the buffet each evening he was always around to make you a special treat and indeed everything he produced was so delicious it was difficult to know when to stop eating. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"An oasis in CHina I have no idea how anyone can give this hotel a bad rap. Please stop complaining about the elevators then in the next line rave about the great views. You cant have one without the other people. The rooms are in beautiful shape and incredibly clean. This hotel makes you fell like you're in Chicago - not in a 3rd world country. The hotel cars are S class Mercedes (very classy)and the suites have a full wall of windows. I've stayed in the Ritz Carlton, Grand Hyatt andn Shangri La among others - and this hotel is heads and shoulders above those. Great location for a walk and shopping too. English skills are spotty across Shanghai and this place is about avg. Laundry comes back in less than 4 hrs with no extra charge. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"A bit dizzying! JW Marriott is a strong hotel. They have everything that should make it a 5 star hotel, but somehow just miss the mark. The rooms are large, modern and comfortable. Bathrooms are nice &amp; include relaxing, homey touches like fragrant bath salts. In-room tea stations are another charming touch. In-room internet connections are speedy. The gym &amp; pool are quite nice. The spa is fair, but extremely accommodating. Spa rooms are quite small &amp; the aestheticians aren’t the best though the prices would lead you to believe otherwise. Food is on the poor side, though it is good for China. The restaurant is average. Room service can be tricky – it can be slow &amp; you need to make sure that you spell out things exactly as you want them or else you end up with “interesting” pairings! Service is mediocre. Everyone is very friendly, but you soon realize that many have a weak understanding of English, which poses some problems. For an American hotel catering to business travelers, the staff should either speak better or let you know that they don’t fully understand &amp; seek out someone else on their staff that does. This language barrier has lead to quite a few misunderstandings &amp; thus delays. Lastly, this hotel is 60 stories high! You don’t even get to the lobby until the 38th floor! While this delights some people, it scares me to death! I prefer shorter buildings. My 1st night here, I never fell asleep because of my nerves! Now as soon as I get into my hotel room, I immediately shut the curtains. My last time here, I had to stay with a coworker on their “Executive” floor. Never again…I learned that the Executive floor(s) were the very top ones. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great stay but could be better We stayed here for 3 nights for pleasure. The hotel had nicely appointed rooms with great views (request for a room with views of Pudong, or you get stuck looking at endless ugly high-rises). The breakfast buffet was wonderful as well.Only a couple of things that slightly tarnished our stay.1. Staff were always smiling but not very proactive. For example: I had to go to the airport at 9pm on a Friday (peak hours for taxis) and there was a long queue (5 of us) waiting in front of the hotel for a car. The 2 bellhops simply stood there and waited for taxis to pull into the hotel. It was obvious some of the guests were headed to the airport and were on a tight schedule. At a 5-star hotel, I would expect the bellhops to be more intuitive/proactive, helping to hail down taxis or by simply calling the taxi company ahead of time to make sure there are cars standing by for guest use during peak hours. 2. Check-in was smooth but check-out was a nightmare. We had 2 rooms, one room was booked with Marriott Reward points and the other room was booked online - the Weekend Transportation package (inclusive of breakfast for 2 people and 8 hour use of a hotel car). When we checked out, we were surprised at all the additional charges that were suppose to be included. It took us about 15 minutes to go over the bill line-by-line with the staff. Eventually, all the charges were removed, but one would expect at a hotel this caliber, those charges inclusive in the package should not have been calculated into the grand total in the first place. So, check your bill carefully when you check out! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Wery nice hotel- sad about Shanghai air The JW Shanghai is a luxury motel in a truly landmark buidling. Do leave yourself a few extra minutes any where you want to go though- the hotel lobby is on the 38th floor and you need to switch elevators to get to hotel rooms from 38 up. We were on the 55th floor with access to the concierge lounge. The rooms were very well decorated with sumptuous bedding. The view we had (rm 5505) included all of the prominent buildings of Shanghai wrapped before us in a great vista- unfortunately the haze of the evening was replaced by the stark reality of Shanghai air pollution during the day. Opening the curtains in the morning light reminded me of a sepia toned photo- shades of grey and brown inter mixed spelling out another day of breathing this all in. The concierge level was very worth while fine wines, dim sum, and a great breakfast. The Marriott is well located to get to anything through out the Shaghai area. For those of you familiar with Hong Kong travel, there is a great MTR and an &quot;Octopus&quot; like transport card can be purchased. The park across the street is a convenient, beautifully arranged bit of greenery where you can catch a few moments surprisingly to yourself. The concierge did a great job of securing us center stage seats for the Shanghai acrobat show- pay the minimla extra for VIP seats- really worth it. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Great Hotel I have spent 2 weeks for business in the JW Marriott in May 2007. The Hotel is great. Room and bathroom are very nice. My room was in the 55th floor with a splendid view. Service is very good also. It was always a pleasure to have breakfast in the 38th floor with great views. On the buffet you find everything you want (including &gt;10 different corn flakes and asian dishes). Another good point was the free wireless lan in the lobby and the executive floor lounge. To sum up: A very good hotel (I 'm sure one of the best in Shanghai) in a good location with excellent service 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great for Business Traveler from USA Regardless of the reviews, I seriously doubt there are 5 better hotels in Shanghai. I had a great experience at the JW in early May (8th - 12th). Check in was a breeze and my corner room was oversized and had everything I needed, included a large bathroom with a view. Upgrading to the Executive Level was a no brainer given the amount of food, beverages, and attentive service. The bed was super comfortable and I never heard any noise in my 47th floor room. The gym was excellant - large and outfitted with modern equipment (and always open). The only negatives were the elevators (required to switch at the 38th floor) and food quality was only above average. Great location if doing business in Puxi area, super clean, attentive service, and a Starbucks downstairs in case one needed a reminder of home. Walked through the nearby Meridien, which seemed nice but was surrounded by construction and locals selling counterfeit product - not ideal in my book. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great Experience Spent a week on holiday with wife and daughter during first week in April. JW marriott is ideally situated near the centre of Shanghai. Very close to museums, shopping, walking distance to the Bund and adjacent to beautiful landscaped gardens. The hotel is located on the edge of what used to be the Shanghai Race course. As well as a Starbucks in the hotel, there is another one 100 yds away and a costa just across the road from just opposite the Ferrari garage which is adjacent to the hotel. The views from the hotel are simply stunning. There is a choice of 3 excellent restaurants. The Spa facilities are also well worth a visit. We found the staff very helpful and eager to please. The room was well equipped, walk in shower etc. with toiletries restocked frequently.Would certainly return. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Very impressed with service at JW Marriott This is a late review but my family and I stayed at the JW Marriott duirng Chinese New Year. We arrive in Shanghai on Chinese New Year's Eve and witnessed many fireworks while we traveled between the airport and the hotel. Upon check-in, we found the staff to be extremely professional. The front desk clerk escorted us to our 54th floor rom with a stunning view towards the Pearl Tower. Throughout the night, fireworks erupted on the skyline which made for a spectacular sight from our room. The room was a standard size Marriott room and the bathroom was especially large with a walk in show and sunken bathtub. Everything about the hotel was 5 star, including the staff. I had to ask the concierge and various staff members to interpret Chinese and provide travel instructions to various venues. They all were extremely pleasant. For breakfast one morning, we had the breakfast buffet and again found the staff to be very nice and the variety of Chinese, Japanese and American food extensive. The view from the 38th floor dining area was also spectacular. We had a chance to use the swimming and whirlpool and locker area...found it very nice. However, it was a bit inconvenient transferring between elevators to get to the pool area. Overall, our Shanghai trip during Chinese New Year was great and the JW Marriott the best place to stay. "

jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Faulty Towers The Marriott means well but they suffer from a problem faced by all the foreign run Hotels in China, they simply can't get quality staff. Customer service in all aspects of shangai life is contrived and not natural but the Marriott should be more than capable of implementing basic hotel standards. They've failed.Designing a hotel room is the easy bit...and yes they've got it right. Beds are comfortable as they are in all Marriotts. But as I said, that should be the easy part.Don't order room service. We all know not to expect bells and whistles when you order to your room, but you at least expect it to be cooked. We tried the room service twice and all I can say is the late night kitchen should be shut down by the food standards agency (that's if one exists).The breakfast was a pleasant surprise with all the usual hotel fodder. Trying to get a cup of coffee in the breakfast room proved rather too much for the staff so my wife and I invented ingenious methods of coaxing them out of hiding, like walking into the kitchen and begging the staff to fill our empty cups. This unforeseen, staff training exercise received hoots of laughter from both us and the staff but they unfortunately failed to pick up on the irony of the episode and continued to ignore the thirsty guests.My advice to Marriott is fly some senior staff up from Hong Kong to show them how its done and my advice to you, the punter, don't stay here! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Luxury with a bearthtaking view to boot I stayed twice at the Tomorrow Square (as what the locals call it, simply 'Ming Tian' i.e. 'Tomorrow', once in late Jan this year and once in end-2005. Twice I was satisfied with the service, the facilities and the location. But for the more recent stay, my satisfaction level increased. For the following few reasons:1. Check-in had been simplified and it was seamless. Previously, when one reaches the hotel, you have to let the bellboy take your luggage, get a tag and then take the express lift to the 38th floor lobby for check in. Then, take another lift on the 38th floor to your room. In the most recent stay, check in took place at the first floor (newly setup) counter, the bellboy goes with you to the room with your luggage. Just that one still needs to go to the 38th floor first to take another lift to the room. Anyway, the improvement shows that this hotel listens to customers' feedback, as I precisely suggested that in my earlier stay.2. They recognise return guests, and they make sure you feel more than welcome. Partially because I stayed more than the standard 2-3 nights, and partially because I have a Marriott Rewards Card, they allowed me a corner room this time round. Slightly bigger than the usual standard room, and with a nice view in your bathroom. Such a nice touch goes miles, at least for me. I feel that they want me back, and that's what I mighyt just do the next time round.3. The smiles in the lower-ranking staff were there and obviously, more had endeavoured to learn to speak English. I am a Mandarin speaker but I notice even the lift attendant, the chambermaid and restaurant waiter all can speak standard English to a big extent. Two thumbs up for this. Maybe because China is preparing for the 2008 Olympics, and Shanghai is gearing up for the 2010 World Expo, but regardless, such efforts are commendable!Of course, this hotel is more than all this. The location near People's Park Square means you are literally at the heart of Puxi, and near many attractions. The main subway station for Lines 1 &amp; 2 is also very near, in about 2-3 mins' walk. Getting a taxi is also straightforward, and some 400-500 metres west of the hotel are some retail shops, restaurants and a supermarket. Within a 5-10 min walking distance too are a local food street, Nanjing Road Pedestrian Mall, Starbucks (just downstairs), McDonald's, banks, post office and shopping for (gaudy) tourist stuff. But as twice I was on business, I didn't really have time to complete the circuit.And oh yes, because Tomorrow is part of such a tall buidling, many people swear by its views. I must say it's quite nice, but oftentimes, the Shanghai skyline is blocked by hazy, cumulus stuff. Pollution perhaps. I personally like Tomorrow for its service, its location, its luxurious facilities and its newness. Stay here if you don't mind paying premium you won't regret it. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Prefect location The view was great from our 53rd floor hotel room. Located by People's Square/Tomorrow Square, many major sites are within walking distance. Taxis are cheap, but traffic is horrible. The City is all about commerce. Great restaurants. Do not miss the City Planning Museum with historical photos as well as future plans. "

All spoke good english.Room was fantastic with a great gym and poolLocation is in the heart of the city next to peoples square and a short walk from the Bund 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Uninspiring - executive rooms are same as deluxe Even though the hotel was booked using the Marriott website, check-in was not instant, it took about ten minutes. The room had big windows, a nice view from the 45th floor. The room itself was uninspiring, no special edge or extreme luxury.We asked for an upgrade to an executive room, only to find that the executive room (except for being 9 floors up) was smaller, had less window than our deluxe. It was just incredible! 60US a night more for a room which is smaller than a regular room! If you're in for the view, pick another hotel, there are plenty of them with rooms on high floors. Considering the JW Marriotts' rates, you'll have no problem finding better value for money in any other place of Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great views good location and service We stayed at this hotel from 31 December to 6 January 2007.We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive suite on 54th floor. The views were stunning! The access to the executive lounge (breakfast, drinks and entrées in the evening) was an excellent added bonus.The room was huge, the bed difficult to get out of. The bose cd/radio was good but as someone else has said a dvd player would have been nice.Service was smiling and ever-helpful. The breakfast buffet plenitful and fresh.The gym is excellent and large, as is the pool. Location is really good but as everyhting is so close by taxi or metro in SHanghai i don't think location is the most important criteria.At any rate I would definitely stay here again. Loved our stay. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Wonderful hotel at a great location. I stayed at the JW Marriott at Tomorrow Square for 3 days for a business trip to China. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in Asia. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite on the top floor, the views were amazing. One tip - if you go to the top floor executive lounge, ask one of the ladies to take you out onto the roof. The door is hidden behind a bookcase in the &quot;highest library in the world&quot;. This is one of the best views of Shanghai! Make sure you do this at night to see the various light displays around the city.This hotel is within walking distance to Nanjing Road as well as the Bund, and has a subway stop right across the street by Starbucks. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Excellent but not the best. The Pros:1. Service is spectacular. But that is true of most 5 star hotels in China, so I don't think the service at the JW is any better than you'd get at a comparably priced hotel in Shanghai. 2. I was given a complimentary upgrade to one of the &quot;service apartment&quot; rooms. These are really condo rooms that include a full kitchen, a separate living room, and a washer/dryer. Since I was on a long trip, the access to a washer dryer was a fantastic bonus. The &quot;service apartment&quot; rooms are on room 10 to 36 so if getting a high floor room is important to you, then you won't like these rooms. On the other hand, the air pollution is so consistently bad in Shanghai that you'll never be able to see squat anyway. 3. The hotel restaurants are very, very good. Expensive, but very good. The nearest cheap places to eat are about 300 yards away in the shopping mall attached to the Radison Hotel. By the way, I would say that the Radison has a much, much superior location. The Cons:1. Other reviewers have raved about the location. Yes, it is very close to the People's Square terminal which gives you access to 2 different lines, but taxis are so cheap in Shanghai that I don't know why people even bother with the train. Plus, the language barrier with the subway employees is insurmountable. My advice is to take the taxis and forget about the subway system.2. For both tourists and business travelers, I believe the Pudong side is more enjoyable and convenient. I spent most of my time going to the Bund and the Pudong side of the river that I wished I stayed there to begin with. 3. Nanjing Road is a major shopping area, but the street peddlers and street prostitutes are so numerous and so aggressive that I will never set foot on that street again. Since the proximity to Nanjing Road is supposed to be one of the JW's selling points, I would discount the location as a factor. 4. The shower was disappointing. Not only was the shower not very powerful, it had one of those cloth shower curtains that kept blowing around and sticking to my leg. Very irritating and not what I'd expect from a 5 star hotel. 5. The toilet was disappointing too. I'm one of those guys that reads on the toilet and there was no direct light above the toilet so it was too dark to read. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great hotel Last time in Shanghai we stayed at the Shangri-la in Pudong. I preferred that hotel, but this was in a better location. The staff were all very friendly and we had a very nice, very well-appointed luxe room. In North American standards this is a very upscale place. But in Shanghai, there a few places that are bit more flashy than this one, like the Hyatt. Nevertheless, this is a great place to stay in a great location. Close to the bund, shopping, and most main attractions. Marriott beds are firm but comfy, and the linens are always quite nice. The breakfast buffet was quite nice, but if you really want to see a buffet hop over to the Shangri-la :-). "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Nice stay here. We recently stayed five nights at this Marriott. It's an American hotel and rating it against American hotels, it's quite good. Rating it against the same class of Asian hotels, it's a notch lower. We travel to Asia once or twice a year for pleasure, partly because the luxury hotels are so outstanding at such a good price. We chose Marriott this time because they were giving 3 frequent flyer points for every dollar you spend. That was irresistable. And this Marriott is well placed in The Bund.The room was average size, pleasant and clean, not anything particularly outstanding about it. All the staff we dealt with were very pleasant. The general restaurant was good. The club room evening appetizers were the most extensive I have seen and clearly meant to subsitute for dinner if wanted. The hotel needs to find a better tour agency to affiliate with. We hired private guides twice, neither was nearly as professional as the guides we had in Beijing or Xian. However, the conceirge can have that agency provide a car and driver only for $20/hr. to take you anywhere you want to go. Like the cab drivers, they speak no English. You give the Concierge your itinerary and they write it in Chinese and discuss it with the driver. As long as you don't want to change it, you're fine. The drivers even park and walk you to the store or ticket window to make sure you know where to go, and are very nice. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fabulous hotel and location Staying here for a few days was a real joy. There was a slight muddle with my booking, which was easily fixed and they upgraded me to an executive floor junior suite.Room was great- only thing i thought missing was more power points for charging equipment.But location is excellent, food at the hotel very good, staff helpful and Shanghai an amazing and interesting city. Many of the things i wanted to visit were in walking distance- and it was hard to get lost as the hotel is a real landmark. And if you needed a cab, they were really plentiful and cheap. Highly recommended! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Beautiful hotel in great location - JW Marriott on Tomorrow Square My family and I stayed at this hotel for the second time in two years. Because the hotel does not begin until the 25th+ floor, the views of the city from the rooms is spectacular. We loved everything about the hotel - the staff, the rooms, and the location. We were withiin walking distance of the major shopping street of Nanjing Road as well as the luxury shops that are located in the opposite direction.. The Bund is also within an easy walking distance. Because there are so many great restaurants in Shanghai, I would not spend money on the hotel food, unless you must for business reasons. It is expensive and better values can be found. We took the subway in Shanghai for the experience but most travel was done by taxi - the cabs are cheap and plentiful. From the JW Marriott, we were never far from any part of Shanghai that we wanted to visit, including the French Concession area and the huge outdoor area where many counterfeit goods are sold.We love Shanghai and recommend this hotel highly. Dont' go in the summer months if you can avoid it. Too hot and humid! "

My wife and I spent 3 nights at the JW Marriott Shanghai on one of the executive level floors, and were upgraded to a suite. This hotel is very new and very modern. The localation is convient to several of the torist areas, and a brisk 15 minute walk to the Bund. The Club level has spectacular views of the Shanghai skyline, and has a very professional and helpful staff.The only downside for the holiday traveler is that you tend to go in and out of the hotel more often than a busienss traveler, and the transfer at the 38th floor to get the lobby gets tireseome.Overall a very good experience.

jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,Great hotel but not for families Hotel has spectacular views in prime location (best views face the river and Pudong). Luxurious accomodations. But no connecting rooms except suites connecting to corner rooms (very expensive). Regular rooms were small-ish. Not a great choice for families. 
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Amazing hotel experience! I have stayed at many Marriott properties around most of the US and some abroad, but this hotel is definitely the best of the bunch. My husband and I are very selective, and we usually stay at Four Seasons hotels or local luxury boutique properties when we vacation. In this particular case, we chose this Marriott because of its location and because I had a zillion points to spend. The service is impeccable, the rooms are chic, and have nice, elegant touches to them. I usually do not eat in hotel restaurants, but I would definitely recommend the Sunday brunch here. If you enjoy Alaskan king crab legs, caviar, foie gras, and free flowing Perrier Jouet, you will love this brunch... All of the concierge staff are knowledgeable and helpful, but I especially counted on the head of staff to assist me as his English was the best of the group. Trust me, in this town, the concierge is your best friend. He can write things down for the taxi drivers, and get you reservations at the hottest places in town. Overall, our experience was perfect from check in to check out, and I would gladly return to this property again. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Awesome Hotel This hotel is AWESOME. Great rooms, great club lounge, great restaurants and bars, great lobby, great location, great spa, etc. My only complaint if i had to have one is service (which i notice other people have also commented on). They really, really need to train the employees 100% more on customer service and this I encountered in all levels of the hotel from check in, to housekeeping, to the club lounge, etc. Probably in the restaurants was the worst. But that aside, I love this hotel and will always choose to stay here when visiting Shanghai. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Excellent Stay at the JW Stayed here for two nights towards the end of May and enjoyed every minute of it! The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. Service was simply outstanding - from the doormen, to the front desk, to the waitstaff at the coffee shop, to housekeeping - and to the staff at the gym! They even had staff waiting by the elevators to hit the &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; button! The gym facilities was top rate and the food at the cafe was very good.Location is not bad - close to the Shanghai Museum and the Nanjing East shopping street. Otherwise, all other sights are easily accessible by taxi - which is not expensive at all. This hotel is highly recommended.As for transfer to the airport, I met this taxi driver (with a new Mercedes Benz vehicle) that arranged for my trip to the airport (domestic) for RMB150. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Holiday Inn at 2000ft I'd spend months planning our trip to China and spent hours researching where to stay during our time in Shanghai but felt disappointed in this hotel.Location wise the hotel is fine. It's within walking distance of the Bund and the French Concession, and there's a subway very close by.However it's not 5 star. Despite being upgraded to a junior suite, the room wasn't worth the money and the overall atmosphere was like being in a Holiday Inn 50 floors above ground. The executive lounge is well stocked and has an excellent view, but the staff are stony faced and the atmosphere is non existent.In general, the hotel staff just didn't seem interested in their guests (maybe we were a bit too pampered at the excellent Four Seasons in Hong Kong and the Peninsula in Beijing). Little things like not having our bags taken to the car when we checked out, mistakes on our bill, not being asked if our stay was OK, being given the wrong type of room when we checked in... they all added up to a mediocre and uninspiring experience.I understand that Marriott is an American chain of hotels, and I'd say that this stands out clearly (and not in a good way either)! "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Loved it Excellent - Excellent - Excellent.Perhaps a little out of the way from some of the attractions, but as taxis are so cheap (you pay about 1.50 US dollars to get to most places in the city), it is definately worth staying there. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Best in Shanghai Great Location, Great Rooms, Great Views.... pretty much sums it up. This hotel has that iconic look to it that can be seen fitting into any major metropolitian area. The rooms were spectacular with grand views of the entire city below. Our room had a seperate sitting area/ office slightly seperated from the bed, which was beyond our expectations and perfect for sleeping off the jet lag from the trip to china. The bathroom was large and featured seperate shower and bath, the shower featured a traditional shower head along with wall mounted spray's that was a nice touch. If you have a chance to access the &quot;executive lounge&quot; great breakfasts and pre dinner meals (the JW Burger is to die for), make if difficult to pull yourself away to try the local fare. Many &quot;food streets&quot; located near by to soak up the local culture, along with muesuems and the Grand Opera House.... the convinent subway system is just a few steps away from the hotel and further makes this a great location. Some problems though: the location of the pool and gym are very hidden and required not only finding the right bank of elavators to take but a walk to a second set of elevators followed by another walk just to get to the pool area, which was painfully kept cold. Not as high profile as perhaps the Grand Hyatt or the Westin on the Bund but second to none in terms of room, location, and service. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Great hotel If your budget can take the hit, I highly recommend this hotel for the location and amenities. I've stayed here twice -- once in the executive floor, and once in a regular room on the 45th floor. They're similar except that the rooms on the executive level are larger and (at least in mine) the bathroom looked out on the skyline -- a really amazing view. Still, my second stay in a regular room was also fine -- just as nice, but without a window in the bath. The bed is amazing. The staff is friendly without being obnoxious, although I do find it strange to have women press elevator buttons for me. Room service is typical Marriott, nothing special. The hotel can arrange for a car to pick you up at the PVG airport, but it's expensive -- 590 RMB (~$73), at least 2x what a normal cab would cost. Still, normal cabs scare the heck out of me in Shanghai because everyone drives so fast and crazy, so I don't mind the cost. I'd warn you that you don't really feel like you're in China while inside the hotel -- it could be New York, London, or Tokyo. So if you're looking for Chinese atmosphere you'll want to look elsewhere. But if you're a tired business traveler (like most people at the hotel), you'll find it a comfortable, dependable place to call home while in Shanghai. Highly recommended. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"almost perfect started the title with almost perfect only because the only bad experience with the hotel was with the front desk lady during check in, was not happy with her as had asked for a non smoking room but ended up with a smoking room, and also to proof that I deserved our co's corporate rate, she made me dig through my luggage in the lobby to find my business card.other than that, food at the hotel was delicious, the view from the room was great, the location is excellent (nice &amp; hip bars and restaurants + all the important museums/theatres are close by), the little plant in the room and flowers in the bathroom were nice touches, the bathrooms was nice (better than Portman Ritz Carlton), the in room coffee was not just an instant mix.was here for 5 nights, it was a nice home away from home, again, almost perfect "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Excellent choice First class Stayed at the hotel for two nights, were upgraded free to a studio suite on the 45th floor. Views spectacular as was the room. Bathroom huge with jacuzzi bath and seperate shower. Bed extreemly comfortable. Swimming pool very good. Nice little touches in room like gifts inc sweets on pillows, pottery teapot in box etc. Staff were very freindly and helpful, always someone to open lifts etc. Only bad points were, we had a cocktail on our first night in the lobby lounge over looking the city but when we tried to repeat this the second night we were told we were not allowed a cocktail in the lobby lounge and that we had to go to the bar if we wanted one. Also prices were quite expensive and there was tax added to everything but I suppose the prices were to be expected in a top class hotel like this one. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Very good but a few niggles My wife and I booked at the JW for a friday and saturday night. The hotel looks fantastic and is quite unique on the skyline. The main lobby is on the 38th floor (strange but true). a very nice bellboy escorted us from the 1st to 38th floor with a bit of information about the hotel and its restuarants, he even gave us a free tourist map when we got to the lobby. the check in was flawless and we had the great fortune of being upgraded to a suite rather than the deluxe room we had booked. the suite was fantastic, on the 45th floow and overlooking the nanjing road. everything was perfect. 2 bathrooms, jacuzzi, lounge area and large separate bedroom. so far so good. now here are the bad points we encountered. on the 1st night we went to the JW Bar (40th floor) and had a nice cocktail. we had been sitting down for only a few minutes when a rather tired looking Chinese girl (wearing an old coat) came to our seating area (a small alcove area with one chair and one long,set back seat) and asked us if we would mind if she sat there. we had no objections as we were talking to each other about plans for the weekend. The Chinese girl then proceeded to ask us where we came from, whether we were husband and wife and finaly saying that she liked English men. As we did not obviously respond in the correct/usual manner she left only to repeat the same thing to a group of Americans, substituting I like English men to American Men. We left the bar and went down to the lobby lounge/bar and had another cocktail which when arrived was not what we had ordered. I took it to the bar and explained that it was wrong (it was a velevet glove which should have had chocolate/vanilla/creme de menthe and cream in it)as this drink did not obviously contain any cream but was rather like a martini. The barman apologised and brought me another free double bourbon whilst he made the correct cocktail. this duly arrived but was still not the correct thing. yes it did contain cream this time, in fact it looked remarkably like a large alcoholic milkshake. still nevermind it tasted nice. The next night we went to the same bar and asked for the cocktail menu, only to be told that they didn't do the cocktails in this bar and we should go to the other bar on the 40th floor. this took us back a little as we had a cocktail at this bar only the day before..but the waitress was adamant that we should go to the 40th. we didn't, we went to our room and rang the service manager expecting some form of apology. we didn't get one, it seems that we shouldn't have been given the cocktail on our 1st night..it was a mistake. explains why it wasn't correctly made. on the whole though a very good hotel. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in An absolutely superb hotel, fantastic service, well equipped room, wonderfully comfortable bed, great resturants and great location.Take time to visit the Mandarin Spa also.Trust me, the Hyatt Pudong is a good hotel, this is much better. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Excellent but slightly behind the Grand Hyatt experience After staying at the stunning Grand Hyatt and disappointing Ritz Carlton, I checked-in to the JW Marriott at Tomorrow Square. I thought after a post Grand Hyatt stay, no other hotel can come close to match the experience. I was quite wrong as the JW Marriott is quite a contender although in no way to outshine Hyatt.LOCATION: Prime position in the middle of Nanjing road with Renmin Park and Shanghai Museum across the road. A visit to the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall amidst the park is a must as it provides scale model of current and future Shanghai. Massive shopping centers and landmark locally-owned department stores are within walking distance.EXTERIOR: Architecturally striking, you either love it or loathe it. The futuristic 60 storey skyscrapers is Shanghai’s third tallest. It resembles a pen with its pyramid shape roof and a unique twisting half of the structure block midway, which is visually interesting when view from different angles. The building is designed by the same architect who gives you the Portman Ritz Carlton, Westin Shanghai, The Oriental and Regent Singapore; and Hyatt Regency Atlanta &amp; San Francisco: the atrium wizard, John Portman.DESIGN: Similar in format to the Grand Hyatt Shanghai: guests are whisked to the lobby at Level 38 (Hyatt is at 54) where views are similarly stunning. With the absence of the central core atrium as in Hyatt, Marriott’s lobby level is more spacious with a smaller 3 storey atrium with a grand staircase leading to the restaurants above. Rooms start from Level 41 to 59 (Hyatt from 57 to 87).ROOMS: Room size is smaller than the Hyatt's, and the plan is typical rectangular hotel rooms. The décor is more the mainstream 5 star hotels which may suit to a wider audience whereas the Hyatt is more design-oriented, sophisticated and stylish. Nonetheless, it is still a nice room with one whole timber panel wall by the bed, and a nice platform by the wall to sit by and enjoy the view. Sitting area is very cramped on twin bed rooms, so look for king bed rooms for extra space. Also, Opt for room facing the Huangpu river / the Oriental Pearl Tower. At mid winter period, the fog obstructed most of the view and you are literally living in the sky. Bathroom is spacious which is nicely finished with bright color marble and frosted glass door.SERVICE: Typical 5 star. There’s always beautiful female staffs by the lift greeting each guest with a seemingly genuine smile at Ground and Lobby levels. Beware of the porter at the entrance who has a way of tricking hotel guests to hire an expensive Mercedes Taxi (not owned by the hotel). We hailed a regular taxi to Zhouzuang (Unesco’s world heritage site) which is a couple hours drive from Shanghai. As we stepped in, the female porter asked us to get out and changed to the Mercedes taxi for what she claimed to be the same price. As we start driving, the driver refused to use the meter and started to bargain the price. He said normally the 4 hours trip would cost RMB1000 (half the hotel price), but for that day he claimed to gladly to offer RMB600. We simply felt cheated, but had no choice. It was a great ride anyway with the brand new Mercedes, so we’re not complaining.FACILITIES: Great facilities on the hotel complex. It has adjoining retail podium which houses Starbucks and other shops; a spacious Mandara Spa, and a rooftop indoor and outdoor pool. During winter, the free-form pool is just a big empty hole. To visit the pool, guests have to pass the Spa entrance, walk across to a different lift bank, take a lift up, then stroll along a long glass-house corridor amidst zen garden before reaching the pool ‘club house’ style lobby. Very nice despite the long journey.OVERALL, a very good hotel. Excellent location, beautiful rooms, comprehensive facilities and good pool area. I would rate this hotel slightly lower than the Grand Hyatt, as Hyatt does it better: better building, better design and more stylish. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Fantastic should be a 5 star! Last Visit:March 2005I spent 2 weeks in Shanghai. We stayed at the Four Seasons(Awful), Grand Hyatt(Average,Poor service) and we stayed at the JW Marriott. We Canceled our other booked nights with Four Seasons/Grand Hyatt and went back to the JW Marriott. The service is fantastic! They really had the quality of service down! It was a great stay. May I recommend getting a club room. The club lounge is an Oasis with fantastic views and great people. They will really help you out if ask!Great place! Highly Recommended and I don't say that often. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Very Nice Hotel -- Skip the Executive Floor though I agree with the previous post for the most part. This hotel is VERY nice. Nice rooms, not huge (and we were upgraded to a corner room which was supposed to be bigger), very nice bathrooms, very comfortable bed (which is hard to find in China). But the executive floor lounge is a dissapointment at best. Hardly any food, hardly anything to drink and bad, rude service. Staying in an executive room by the way is EXACTLY the same as staying in standard room. I have stayed here like 8 times now and have been in both. So don't pay extra for the executive room - you aren't getting anything for it but access to the executive lounge which I have just explained is not worth it. I've heard wonderful things about the Westin and plan to try that one next time. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"Wonderful Views I recently stayed at the JW Marriott after reading reviews in Trip Advisor. My friend and I stayed in an Executive Room - not all that big but fairly comfortable. Bathroom was a bit disappointing as it was much smaller than I had been led to believe. We were on the 57th floor with a magnificent view towards the Bund. The Executive lounge was on the 59th. The food in the Executive lounge was fairly ordinary but very nice never the less. The drink was another matter - this was only served between 5 and 7.30. Not once did we receive a drink that was well mixed, there was either too much gin, too much tonic etc., The last night I asked for a brandy and ginger but was told they had &quot;none left&quot;.Everytime (and that was quite often) that we went to the lounge we were asked our room number. We were there for 6 days so it seemed a bit strange that we were asked so many times. Two woman amongst mainly men, you would have thought we would have stood out.We went on two tours with a tour group recommended by the hotel - the first was round Shanghai and we were a little disappointed at the lack of ground covered in 8 hours. The next tour was to Zhouzhuang - just a driver and guide. The guide was not forthcoming with much information and we wandered round this beautiful water village having lunch at a very mediocre little place. On the way back instead of telling us information he had the audacity to go to sleep. I also found that having a car with driver and guide becomes a shopping trip where you are taken to places to buy - commission I guess being the incentive. If you are in a larger tour party the pressure is not put on you to buy. We would not use this tour company again.Other than that compared with Club and Executive rooms I have stayed in the JW at Tomorrow Square was very uninspiring. The hotel though is a magnificent hotel and well worth a visit but don't bother about the executive lounge unless you are a business person ane require their facilities. "
jw marriott hotel shanghai at tomorrow square ,"A Many Splendored Thing We live in Canada everything is self-service in so called 5 star establishment.This hotel is tomorrow's future but in tody's dain age. Staff are drowning with politeness. Was upgraded to a large corner room.Each time you leave the room they will come in and tidy up. Stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Sept./05. Standard is about the same.Food is excellent and location is great.Stayed at The Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas last week nothing to write home about, everything is self-service.Welcome China you will be the new superpower, you lead others follow and envy.

lansheng hotel shanghai ,"You can find something better Our room was pretty old but clean. On arrival we were upgraded to a big suite, which was a nice surprise, still they should refurnish the rooms.Breakfast was ok, nothing special though. The staff were not very friendly or helpful, a mix of not understanding and not caring.The hotel is far from everything, but a taxi ride to The Bund costs only about 25RMB, very cheap.I think you can find a better hotel for the same price. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Overall a very good experience I stayed here on a freind's recommendation that this was closer to the &quot;real Shanghai&quot;. I was not disappointed. The rooms were very nice - not 5* - but 4*+. Breakfast buffet was very, very good as well as the coffee served during breakfast time.The hotel is about 400M from the Metro so it was fairly convenient. If you feel like taking a stroll, the #3 line is about 1KM away. Best of all, the staff was very accomodating and they do speak english and they are very helpful.All in all, a very good stay. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Comfortable Hotel but Business not Tourist Location If you want a hotel that is near a motorway then this is a good one for you. Actually it is situated vitually underneathe the intersection of two main Highways in the North WEst of the City. Location wise it suits the businessman but really inconvenient for the traveller. Fortunately the Travel Co I was travelling with provided transport to downtown - fortunate as this hotel is nowhere near a subway station or anything of interest whatsoever.Taxis are very cheap still in China so it is not a disaster.Bar in the lobby is souless - but the rooms are spacious, clean and the bathrooms are very big. Buffet breakfast provides western and oriental cuisine and is fine. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Location could be a problem I can rate this hotel as above average for me, because at the end of all day touring I had no desire to go out at night. I did have a look around and there is nothing to do in the vicinity. No bars, clubs shops or restaurants.The modern hotel did provide good facilities with food and service being of a high standard. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Management problems The hotels name is now Shanghai Lansheng Hotel, does not carry anymore SAS Radisson in its name.The rooms are spacious, clean and well acceptable. It is however very evident that the hotel is facing a range of management problems. Facilities which the hotel may have had in the past like KTV, disco are closed. The bar most time closed, when I looked into it it was always empty.The hotel is suffering unfriendly male pe3rsonnel presenting some attitude like not having to serve Non-Chinese guest. The only highlight some friendly female trainees which better than all the other hotel staff.During 2 months of stay I noted frequent interruptions of the supply of water to the guest rooms due to maintenance. On some occasions these interruptions exceeded the time as indicated on the hotel TV channel.Negative also the location, no real attractions in the vicinity of the hotel.Considering the 4 stars and it’s 4 star price, Shanghai certainly to provide better options. Acceptable only at a discounted low rate. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Bad location We stayed in Shanghai for 4 nights in June 2006 at this hotel. Out tour operator Kuoni offered 2 hotels in Shanghai - this one and the Shrangri La (which was very expensive). We had concerns about the location before we left and were proved correct. There is absolutely nothing around the hotel. You have to get a taxi wherever you go and need to avoid doing this in rush hour as it takes longer. The taxis were cheap but when we tried to get a taxi from the New World to the hotel at night some of the taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was and did not take us. On one occasion, we had to direct the taxi driver to our hotel - not easy when he did not speak english.The breakfast was average, although the rooms were a good size. The view from the hotel room was uninspiring - a concrete jungle. Having been there, I think it would be better to stay at Howard Johnson or Ramada. We did ask our travel company for an alternative, but they were unable to offer this to us. "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel would go back again and again! I loved this hotel, the rooms were big, clean and nicely decorated, we had a king size bed, huge bathroom with seperate shower and bath, breakfast was lovely, there were some works going on outside of the hotel but didn't effect our stay, good location 5 star! "
lansheng hotel shanghai ,stay away travellers beware this hotel was the worst experience of my life all the rooms smelt mouldy and they even had a dehumidifier in the middle of the lounge area i wouldnt recommend it to my worst ememy 
lansheng hotel shanghai ,"Stay somewhere else We stayed here May 2004 for over a week and were disappointed. Rooms: The rooms were badly in need of a remodel. The carpet was faded and stained. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well. The bedding was old and dingy. The room and entire floor reeked of smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room. The view was interesting, especially in the morning when the bicycle traffic comes by. The breakfast served was good, though the same every day which gets boring.Location: This hotel is far from nearly everything. You will have to take a taxi everywhere you go. It was about 20 or 30 minutes to get downtown to all of the main sites. Fortunately that taxi ride was often only $5. Overall, there are many other nicer hotels in better locations. I would not stay here again. "

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Wonderful Hotel We stayed at Le Meridien during our Shanghai part of our China trip. I had a cold and was feeling a little miserable when we arrived. But as soon as I entered the room, I had forgotten my cold! Our room was on the 36th(?) floor and the view was wonderful. Although the room was not large, it felt spacious. The furnishing was modern contemporary. My husband liked the rain shower. The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing. The only thing was internet was not included, and we thought we could do without. (We had internet with our previous China hotels and we thought we did not use it that much. But we missed it here when we had no access.)We are thinking about returning China in a year or two, with our children. We would love to stay at Le Meridien again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Great Location This is a hotel in a great location if you're on a holiday/leisure trip. It is right on Nanjing Lu surrounded with shops, restaurants and cafes right literally &quot;at your doorsteps&quot;, and for one who enjoys the bustle of city life. The breakfast offered by the hotel didn't dissapoint us - we were happy with the selection provided, and the rooms were well appointed. It is very convenient and well located which caters well for a family travelling with young children.I also have a sister who is disabled travelling with us. We found the hotel to be convenient, due to its location. We were able to move about freely without obtacles and were able to wander around the vicinity without any difficulty. My family had a wonderful vacation and we were glad to have chosen this hotel. In fact, a month after our return home, my family have talked about an impending return for another stay at this hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Superb - Location roomsservice and Restaurants all top class I was lucky enough to stay here for 5 days recently. The brand of Royal Meridien is showing others how to do it, with sophistication, freindliness and professionalism throughout. Firstly the location is as good as it gets - right in the middle of cosmopolitan Shanghai , on Nanjing Road. Next the rooms are perfection. They manage to turn the typical box shape into something with character and comfort that is a pleasure to stay in. Food - what better can you expect that a top quality French Restraunt with a Maitre D' who is as good as it gets - if not better!, An Italian, actually run by an Italian that serves a divine pasta, and if that isn't enough a Chinese that is genuine high quality Chinese. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"This hotel sets new highs for standards Le Meridien Shanghai is a very nice hotel to stay at whether you are there as a tourist or business traveler. This is a return visit for me to this establishment as I was so impressed with it on my last trip 6 months ago. Nothing has changed; it still is a great hotel. I stayed in a Grand Deluxe room with king bed on the 28th floor. It was a corner suite that had floor to ceiling views towards the city and also the Bund. This hotel is located within easy access to the city by the Nanjing Pedestrian Walkway and is right next to the main Metro Station and is within walking distance to The Bund. The rooms here are large and nicely proportioned. The hotel is not that old and all the furnishings are of a high quality. There is a 42” plasma with DVD player for entertainment. The separate bathroom with individual shower and toilet is a nice finish. The layout takes great opportunity to use the views by positioning a window that runs along the length of the bath. There is a separate room that incorporated 2 wardrobes and safe tucking everything nicely away from the main room area. The ceilings are nice and high and give that feeling of spaciousness. In fact the whole room provided a feeling that you weren’t actually in a hotel at all, but in a swanky high rise apartment. This is a nice touch after spending too many hours in cookie cutter type hotel rooms. Whilst at Le Royal Meridien I sampled both room service and the restaurant located on the lobby floor – Le Bistrot. The food provided here is of the highest standards and the breakfast buffet in Le Bistrot restaurant probably has the largest selection of different foods. The only negative that I could find to fault the stay here is that the hotel advertises it has LÓccitane toiletries which they did on my last visit but had disappeared this time.From a working perspective the room had a glass table against a wall with a fold out suite of power plugs for varying voltages which was handy. The concierge service was efficient and courteous with all requests being met with a smile which goes a long way for a weary business traveler.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel for either business or leisure. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Modern central lots of art great for a conference I hosted a conference of 60 people here. Wonderful facilities and helpful staff. The conference organiser (Florence) stayed on-site for the duration of the conference to provide 24 hour service. Room are wonderful and modern. Great bed. Breakfast buffet could be a little better, but still very good. The club (executive) lounge is a wonderful airy space with the two best Board rooms I've seen. They are like round fishbowls with sliding curved glass doors. Awesome. Foyer and general areas are full of little nooks to discover art pieces, and generally beautiful architecture. The massive square arched fishbowl is something to behold. I love this hotel "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Modern and happening hotel We stayed for 3 nights in October 2009. We were in a corner room with east and west views of Shanghai. The view was slightly disappointing -- what was advertised as a room with a view of the Bund was really a room with a view of part of the Bund, with a buliding across the street from the hotel obscuring the majority of the Bund. However, we were sufficiently satisfied not to ask for a change. There were literally a wall of windows on both sides of the room. The room was nice and spacious and the décor was very modern. There was a separate dressing area with a row of closets. There was a separate seating area with a couch, a coffee table, and a plush chair and a large flat screen TV which could swivel. The bathroom was nice but it was obvious that it could do with some maintenance and was a bit dated. There were just two things that would have been nicer. First, the wall of windows stretched into the bathroom, right next to the tub. If the shades were not drawn in the bathroom, people in the adjacent building would get a nice show. It was also a little difficult to reach the the draw string for the shades since the tub was in front of the window. Second, the cabinent housing the sink was stand-alone, in line with the modern décor. That meant, however, that there was no backsplash but, instead, a several inch gap between edge of the cabinet and the wall. Several items dropped from the counter through that space. This is a busy hotel and very modern and happening. The lobby area is bustling and had a wonderful vibe to it. We did not have time to get a drink in the lobby bar but it would probably be a great place to people watch. We had a drink at the bar at the top of the hotel which had great views of the city. The concierge was very good. Their suggestions were very helpful. The location of the hotel could not be better. It is right on Nanjing Road (east) and about a 15 minute leisurely stroll to the Bund. We had the buffet breakfast which had an enormous variety of choices. It was very good and service was outstanding. A wonderful hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Hotel is OK location is perfect. The hotel is just OK, pretty much what you would expect of a 4-star hotel. The service levels in China are not very high, so don't expect much service at any hotel; you can read my reviews of other hotels in China on here. We didn't find the elevators to be confusing at all, anyone with a little common sense should be able to figure them out: elevators take you form the ground floor to the lobby level and then you board a different elevator depending n which floor you are going to. We had two rooms: one with 2 twin beds and one with a king bed, both had nice views of the park and museums, but were rather small.The location is perfect, right on Nanjing road and you can walk to a number of restaurants, shops, museums, subway, the Bund, etc. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great location but small room. I decided to try out Le Royal Meridien this time around due to several recommendations from friends. I usually stay in the Westin Bund center. So, here it is....Pros1) SUPER GREAT LOCATION...smack in the center of People's square and has some great restaurants and stores just at the base of the hotel. 2) Really stylish rooms...very comfortable beds.3) Great view of people's square from your room4) Awesome bar on the top with incredible views.5)South beauty restaurant is just next to the hotel....i love this restaurant.6) Hi-speed internet but no wifi7) Service is top notch.Cons1) rooms are smaller than Westin. (maybe 40% smaller)2) Since hotel is on the upper floors...so is the main lobby....so you need to ride 2 sets of elevators...one to get to the lobby, then another to go to your room floor.3)Buffet breakfast is not as good as the Westin.4) Bathroom shower is not as good as the westin.Overall, i would probably stay here again because i like the location....too bad it is more expensive than the westin...and not as good. (i would stay here again if the company paid for it....hahaha... otherwise, i think i will stay at the westin) "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"My new favorite hotel in Shanghai I travel to Shanghai from tiem to time - I have stayed in Pudong and on the Bund, but this time one of my colleagues, Joe Sloboda decided to &quot;Priceline&quot; a hotel in the area around Nanjing Road - what we got was Le Royal Meridien and it was absolutely the best hotel I have ever stayed in while in Shanghai especially considering the gret room rate we were able to get.The location could not be more convenient - right on Nanjing Road, just steps from the subway station and a short taxi ride to the Maglev station. People's Square Park is right across the street and you are also a RMB 4 taxi ride to the Bund or to XiTangDiThe hotel itself was outstanding, the level of service was fantastic, from the doorman to the front desk to the wait staff at the lobby restaurant all the way to the 65th floor bar - everyone is pleasant and happy to be of service.The food in the breakfast buffet is great, western breakfast, traditional chinese and much in between ( a little pricey but you definately will not go hungry either) - drinks in the lobby bar are also a bit expensive, but the atmosphere is great and the service is great.If you are looking for some great views of the financial district across the river into Pudong then I suggest going up to the 65th or 64th floor bars. The 65th is a bit more elegant with ample seating areas and a great place to relax with friends while enjoying the views.If you are looking for something a little more laid back then go 1 floor down to 64 and you can play billiards and have more of a &quot;pub like&quot; atmosphere.When it comes to the rooms I have to say they are &quot;top notch&quot; - the beds are incredibly comfortable, rooms are spacious, with good work area and sitting area. The shower even has a &quot;view&quot; with a large glass window that allows you to look out through your room over the city (quite interesting - but eventually I found the button to draw the shades).There is great shopping in the mall that is on the first 8 floors so you can find anything you are looking for (this is not a bargain market like over in Pudong) but rather a proper shopping mallThere are also fantastic restaurants on the 8th floor just 1 level down from the main lobby The business center is easy to locate and staffed at all hours - a little pricey to print documents but the staff is very knowledgeable and helpfulBottom line is I love this hotel - I love the location, the service and the ammenities - I will be sure to stay here again next spring when I return to Shanghai.

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Best view in town We just spent 5 great nights at the Royal Meridien in a room with the most astonishing view.We weren't in a Club room but booked a Grand Deluxe room with a Bund view....The 37th floor room was spacious, and very comfortable with a floor to ceiling window that had a panoramic view up Nanjing Rd and to the Pudong skyline.....breathtaking.The hotel is very quiet, amazing in a 700 room establishment.The young guys manning the concierge desk were incredibly helpful with any phone requests to book restaurants, write directions for taxis (essential) etc.A note on the integrity of the hotel....my husband accidentally left HK$900 in the pocket of a pair of jeans he sent to the laundry. A note was left in our room telling us the money was in a safe waiting for us to collect it....fantasticYes, the lifts can be a little confusing at first ...but that is because the lobby is not on the ground floor, but 11 stories up.The bathroom layout is unusual but great for women who want to use the mirror for make-up without the bathroom being steamed up by a partner taking a shower.The view is great from the top floor bar but the atmosphere can be ruined by smokers.The food in the Ai Mei restaurant is very good, as is the service.My husband had 2 massages in the Spa and raved about them.Location is tops, on the corner opposite People's Park....by the way, don't fall for the Shanghai Tea scam....young Chinese befriending you then taking you off for tea which ends up costng a fortune. We weren't hit but plenty have been.In all....a great experience in a good hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good Business Hotel Just spend two nights at the Le Royal Meridien Shanghai as one of my stops on my recent China trip.Great location with easy access to the main walking street in the center of town and the Bund. I booked a room which had access to the Executive Lounge. Best Choice Ever and money well spent! Great Food &amp; Drinks thoughout the day are offered there on a complementary basis. And the view is incredible. Since they also serve breakfast up there, this is a great place to start the day. We also used one of the meeting rooms of the llounge and the service was excellent. The room I stayed in itself was modern, large and very functional. I especially liked the TV which can be turned to watch TV either from the bed, desk or couch (and even the bathroom!). The only thing I did not like was the fact that you had to change Elevators several times to go to the room or to the lounge. Overall a very solid hotel! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Nice hotel but I can imagine there are far better in Shanghai We're not your usual 5-star hotel clients, we were just in the middle of a bit of a global holiday, but a friend of my partner's dad graciously put us up in this hotel for a couple of nights while we were in Shanghai. Over the past few weeks we've slept on people's couches in Milan, 1-star hotels in Paris and 3-star hotels in Hong Kong, so this review is from the view of a budget-conscious young couple that care more about what's outside the hotel than in...Le Meredien looks and sounds quite fancy, but from the outset the service seemed a little odd. We had a disinterested offer from the staff downstairs to take out suitcases, which we declined as we were fine to do it ourselves, but that was the end of that conversation. We were then left to our own devices to discover where to check in (half way up the building, up a shuttle elevator). It would be nice if they had more staff downstairs to help in this regard.Once we made it to the lobby floor, things went a bit smoother, checkin went OK, but not that welcoming.Our room was one of the executive ones on the 53rd floor. The view was fantastic, the room a little small, but very comfy and clean. It became quickly apparent that it was mostly business people staying on those floors, and we got some interesting looks from other guests as we wandered around in t-shirts and shorts, but meh.The rest of our stay was alright. We had breakfast the first morning in the executive lounge, which we thought was nice enough, but we discovered on the second morning that the lobby buffet was far more extensive and enjoyed that a lot more. We went down to the pool one evening just before closing and were disappointed the jacuzzi was turned off already, but otherwise that was nice. The gym was a bit small and lacking equipment, but has a nice view.The location of this hotel is awesome. The metro is across the road, the Nenjing Road walking street connects to the hotel too, so that's easy enough.I don't really know how to sum this up. There is no way in the world I'd pay the price tag for this hotel myself (or would choose 5-star accomodation in the first place), but I was certainly underwhelmed with what one gets for the price tag of 3,000RMB/night that our room cost. The room itself was nice, the location was nice, the people were pretty but not that helpful... "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Modern and Glassy The decor was not what we'd expected. It was modern with mirror galore, along the hallways and in elevators. To get to the lobby, you had to take an elevator from the street entrance. Once inside the elevator, you could hear the chirping of birds, to relaxe and calm or to annoy guests? At the lobby level, you had to take another elevator to your room with room key identification, or the elevator just would not take you to your floor. The elevator doors were made to resemble some futuristic chamber entrance, and you almost could'nt help muttering &quot; beam me up&quot;. The room (twin) was clean. Location of the hotel was good with a short cab ride to almost anywhere and the subway station was just a few minutes walk away. It's close to People's Square so that on a sunny morning with BLUE sky, it made for a wonderful stroll around ther and to Shanghai Museum.The staff was trying their best to impress from getting you a cab to showing you the right elevator to your room. Breakfast at the lobby level was the usual fair. The food at the Chinese restaurant was good. The last word, it is not your homey type of hotel, it is glitzy and dizzying, perhaps a reflection of modern Shanghai "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Beautiful hotel in a very good location We were fortunate enough to have a &quot;free weekend night&quot; earned through the Starwood Preferred Guest promotion earlier in the summer of 2009. Given that we planned our Shanghai trip long before the actual date, we booked the free night at le Meridien without hesitation. I am not sure if I would the full price for this hotel. This was our second stay at the hotel (last one was in April 2008).Everything was as expected for the Meridien tier of SPG. The only complaints are:1) Perhaps this hotel is in need of minor renovations as we noticed that the floor corners in the bathroom had minor stains.2) There was a &quot;buy 1 get 1 free&quot; coupon attached to a bottled water for the bar at the top of the hotel. However, it is not a true &quot;buy 1 get 1 free&quot;. The free beverage must be non-alcaholic and the waitresses had a hard time explaining how the coupon worked... not sure if this deal is still on any more but watch out if you are to take advantage of the coupon. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Beautiful rooms great food unfortunately mediocre service I stayed here 2 years ago after deciding to treat myself to a luxury hotel for once. I wasn't disappointed. The hotel was amazing, it was stunning inside. The room was by far the best hotel room I've ever been in. So many features, from being able to watch the enormous swivelling TV from anywhere in the room (including bathroom) to the wonderful views of the city. Really well decorated, incredibly comfortable and it was just a 'basic' room.So much going on on the doorstep of the hotel, and the hotel bar at the top was lovely. The food was first rate, different every day and so varied each day.Unfortunately it really lacked character, just due to the service. The staff made me quite aware that I was younger than many of the other guests, and I can't remember a single piece of good face to face service. I would definitely stay there again, however the real lack of 5* (or even 3*) service meant that the place just had no atmosphere. Walking through a luxury hotel, every member of staff should greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome, rather than a forced nod, or worse, a wry look of 'what are you doing in here?'. I'm still giving it top marks because all this just isn't a deal breaker considering it's pros. Perhaps this has changed by now 2 years on, but I imagine their still high ranking (#1 2 years ago, ~#3 now) must mean that they don't need to. Shame, almost perfect. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Luxury in the Heart of Shanghai Stayed here for three nights on a recent trip to Shanghai and we thought this was just a beautiful hotel from top to bottom. Staff were very attentive and helpful. The location is ideal at the start of the pedestrian East Nanjing Rd. Near the Remjin Park, Shanghai Museum and The Bund. People's Square Metro is close by if you need to get to other parts of the city. A lovely pool though the gym needed upgrading. Breakfast buffet was delicious with so much to choose from. Thought the dinners were a bit pricey but there are so many inexpensive options close by. The bar is worth a drink for the view alone. "

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Epic Fail on many levels- Amazing on others. Ok here goes...I have struggled for days about this review- so please excuse me if I rant or rave.I want to qualify what follows by letting you know that I stayed at Le Meridien as the second week of my honeymoon in September 2009, after a week in Beijing. I have raved to my wife about China for years now and the choice to honeymoon here was both an easy decision and an exciting one. I lived in China in 2003-2004 as an English teacher, and have also lived and worked in London, Paris, Sydney, Chile, and toured every continent except Africa. As a professional musician in a well known band I am somewhat used to the polarising nature of travel and touring- often the best service is in a hostel whilst the worst is in a 5 or 6 star hotel.For my honeymoon, we decided we would not play the &quot;famous musician&quot; card and travel as relatively anonymous honeymooners- we would pay for 5 star hotels and expect great service. We saved for months so that we could have the best of everything. Having just stayed at the Hilton Wangfujing in Beijing, who had spoilt us beyond belief, perhaps our expectations had been slightly distorted by the standard of service we had just recieved. However I make no excuses for what is to follow below.We had booked a limousine pick up through the hotel which was on time and helpful, although the driver spoke no English he was certainly friendly enough, and with a conversational Mandarin traveller like myself, we had no problems with the airport transfer.We arrived at the hotel where the bellboys swarmed on us like flies; a useful bunch after our flight and drive from the airport. As we approached the check in desk, we could see the whispers turn into chatter, so I of course listened to the comments about my long hair and eyebrow ring- surely they had seen an Australian before. Immediately it became clear that the front desk check in was not at all the &quot;personalised&quot; check in service that is touted on Meridien's service guides. The desk girl did not welcome us, was all business, and immediately we felt out of place. There was no welcome drink, although my wife and I were soaked, having endured the musty environs of Hongqiao airport and the subsequent afternoon traffic jam. The check in girl slapped the door cards on the table and told us to have a nice day- no word of the elevator positioning, noone to take our bags up, no quick rundown of the location- nothing but an attempt to upsell us to a bigger room. During check in ? You bet.We found our way upstairs and realised that we had not been given the smoking room or the view we had booked. We phoned down immediately and asked to be changed to the correct room, before we had settled. We were told that someone would be sent up immediately. Fifteen minutes of waiting in the hallway with our bags, I went downstairs to sort out this small issue, where 4 or 5 American business guests in suits were being treated to scotch on the rocks during check in ! As executive club guests this was the service promised to us and which we had not received ! I would have been stoked with a glass of water..My new room key was handed over. It was for a smoking room, but not the floor level, view or size that we had booked and paid for through Expedia. It was clear that our booking specs had not been passed on to the hotel by Expedia, so we phoned downstairs to ask if we were even booked as honeymoon guests- a very poor English speaker told us &quot;I check and call back&quot;. The call never came.At all times we were made to feel out of place. This is not a paranoid insecurity of ours, as my experience of China, upmarket hotels and good service is as real and current as any busy executive. The behind our back audible-chatter, the disinterested concierges, managers, staff and constant disappointments began to swell up over the first 3 or 4 days, until I was forced to call the manager downstairs wih a large list of complaints.At risk of sounding like a miserable sod I should let you know what we liked about the hotel:The location is perfect. Right at the top of Nanjing Lu, China's shopping mecca, the view on all sides of the building are incredible, and the hotel is smack bang in the centre of Shanghai geographically. The rooms, while a little small, are beautifully presented, the room services are great and the appliances, toiletries and appointments are luxurious and modern.We had access to the Executive Floor, which includes breakfast each morning, afternoon drinks and snacks, an open bar at night between 5.30 and 8.00 pm, and complimentary high speed PC's and broadband. Everything in this room is incredible; the view, the service, the food, and the free alcohol. We always felt welcome on this floor and were treated very professionally. In fact if we had not paid for this privelege, I dare say we would have checked out after the second day- the food really is world class in this lounge- a selection of French, Asian, Western and traditional buffet food.The spread is so large at afternoon &quot;cocktails&quot; that we needn't have eaten anywhere else during our stay- we used this spead as dinner almost every night- food was different every time- and an example of one night was:mini hamburgers, a selection of world-class imported cheeses, breads and pestos, chinese dumplings, parma ham, meat selections, fruits, prawns, calamari, soups, steamed veges, shanghai style noodles, chicken skewers, rice, spring rolls etc etc...literlly 20 or 25 meals to choose from, all buffet style, with unlimited beer bottles, cans of soft drink, wines, juices and top shelf alcohol to help yourself to. Breakfast was just as wide-reaching and kept us full until the afternoon.The only downside here is that we discovered that our &quot;Bali Belly&quot; was caused by our breakfast coffees in the Club lounge- we are still unsure of whether the water they used or their &quot;milk&quot; was the problem, but on the 5th day after drinking and eating nothing but the coffee before breakfast, we both got sick almost instantly- and this explained the previous 5 days of sore stomachs and fun in the bathroom. A shame as we enjoyed the morning coffees. Other than that, the food and drink were of a 5 star standard.Now back to the unfortunate parts:Whenever we asked for anything, we were told to do it ourselves or that we didn't need it. We never asked for anything that one would not expect ANY hotel to help with. For instance:We asked around 2.30 pm on Saturday if the concierge could book us a taxi for 6.30 pm as we had show tickets booked and had missed a show in Beijing the week before due to the busy peak hour period. The concierge stared blankly at us as if we had asked for diamond encrusted toothbrushes, and told us &quot;you don't need it; there are always taxis&quot;. This we knew to be VERY untrue during peak hour, however to avoid argument we thanked him and went downstairs to ask if the bellboy, who we had seen book many taxis before whilst we waited in line, if he could help us, but were given the same attitude and refusal despite his job description being exactly what we had requested. Oh well..Imagine our complete lack of surprise when at 6.55 we had been standing in line downstairs for 45 minutes with 10 or so guests in front of us waiting for taxis that were not forthcoming !! We needed to pick up our tickets by 7 pm at a location at least 25 minutes away, and I asked the same bellboy if he could get us into the next taxi as I was not impressed at the way things were looking considering we had asked for help hours earlier. Suddenly his English diminished and he palmed me off a card with the hotel address, and said &quot;Is this what you want.&quot; hmmm... in fact the English skills of staff for the most part were very poor, but the sudden lack of any empathy was astounding. When a wealthy Italian guest strolled out with several, let's say &quot;high class&quot; ladies in tow, he was instantly ushered into the next taxi. The guests in front of us who had been waiting even longer than us were unimpressed.We were given the same treatment when we phoned the concierge to have them bring up a menu from their restaurants downstairs in the hotel. We were going to entertain important business clients from our record label and wished to make the right choice as this was their first visit to Shanghai. 10 minutes later we got a call from the front desk telling us &quot;you can go to each of the resturants and see the menus for yourself&quot;, We didnt have time, even moreso now that we had wasted 10 minutes waiting for menus that never came. The attitude was surprising although not uncommon- my wife did everything she could to stop me from raising hell downstairs, and of course I relented. It was our honeymoon and we were determined to make it a special time.This was typical of the service we got from the concierge and the staff in general. When we arrived in taxis, 3 or 4 staff members would swarm us as per arrival with their hands out for tips, sarcastic smiles and smutterings of ridicule in Mandarin when our backs were turned, yet when we arrived behind a supposedly wealthier guest in a suit, there was not even a single person to open the door for us. Please don't get me wrong, I know how to open a taxi door and am no snob, however I just wish to highlight the extremely polarising nature of the service. If the service had been even average we would have spent thousands more at the hotel.On another occasion, the door guy had passed on the name of the place we intended to travel to the taxi driver as was their usual service- so imagine our disappointment when we were dropped of in a semi-rural setting that was miles from our location, at a street that was at best vaguely similar to the street name I had told him. As a Mandarin speaker, the problem was taken care of quick enough and the extra few bucks for the taxi was no big deal- but if a solo lady traveller with no Mandarin language skills experienced the same trip and ended up in hicksville then things could end up ugly. These same bellboys act as security, a term I use loosely: as whenever you step out of the hotel, due to the location you are harrassed by everyone from beggars to pimps to hookers to contraband dealers, yet when late one night I was returing from a short junkfood mission, I was accosted by a drunk pimp who was a little too touchy for my liking despite my continued denials for his services, and as things got a little heated and I was considering taking the argument to another level, a security guy from the hotel appeared from the shadows as he was doing his usual lap around the block which they do as some sort of PR exercise to make you feel safe. Whilst I have no fears for my physical safety and was clearly about to tear this guy a new one, the security guy dropped his eyes and marched quickly past us and out of sight- he was definitely not up for helping or calming the situation, despite the obvious issue- so I am not sure what his purpose is, other than the aforementioned PR exercise.In their 789 Bar on the top 3 floors, with an amazing view, we had booked a private table for a night out several weeks ago before we even arrived in China- but when we arrived, there was no booking on record- we had been thrown into a table directly immediately in front of the DJ booth and not at all privtae and romantic as I had planned for my wife. The drinks came and they were terrible: a black russian was made with barely any coke and tasted terrible. We were informed that the staff of attractive ladies were poached from other hotels for their looks alone. Unfortunately our cocktails were almost undrinkable because of it. We ordered several coktails from the menu, and every one of them was barely drinkable- every time we ordered we had to point to the menu as the staff had no idea what drinks we were asking for- even their own signature &quot;789 Shooter&quot; !!! When we had ordered before last drinks were called, had tipped well, paid in cash and were finishing up our drinks just as the bar closed, we were asked to leave by the bar girl whom we had just tipped a week's wages, as &quot;housekeeping need to come in and clean&quot;. Wow. The standard of drinks or service did not improve over several days- so we settle on a bottle of vodka from the local liquor outlet, and our ipod and cocktails in our room for the next few nights. The view in that bar was amazing though.Eventually we phoned the concierge to voice our issues, and find out if we could get the room and service we had paid for. We explained that we had not felt like we were on honeymoon and that the service was poor. The manager told us that we were not down in their system as honeymoon guests and that it was Expedia's faultand that the Manager would make some calls, however we had phoned the concierge within an hour of our arrival on Day One to clarify the &quot;honeymooners&quot; issue but were never replied to. Within five minutes a bottle of red wine arrived, and in another 10 minutes a bottle of champagne, with a welcoming letter asking us to enjoy our honeymoon. Considering we had been staying here for 5 days, and the letter was dated today, it compunded the fact that this gesture was 5 days too late, and that our actual issues were being ignored- that they just threw some alcohol at the problem instead of tending to the problem- we never heard from the manager, and when the champagne arrived both staff members were obviously cut that we didn't tip them. I didn't say anything when I noticed the looks, but when my wife asked me if I had seen it I had to agree. Even an attempt to shut us up seemed to be a failure. I love China- the people, the locals, the food, the history and culture- I have lived here, taught China's children, done business and had many amazing moments here- so do not misread what I am about to say- but the problem with the hotel, as confirmed to me by some of the western staff, is that Meridien has cut corners, as many businesses do in China, in order to maintain profit- clearly, hiring standards are not high, and many of the menial jobs are being given to locals whose education and vision of the 5 star ethos is well below par. The resentment from local staff in these thankless positions is glaringly obvious; and in some part understandable considering their job consists of witnessing and supplementing us westerners who are living cashed-up exorbonant lifestlyes under their noses; and it is not these people that I blame for the poor service, as I have been in that position and know the feeling all too well. However, a hotel such as Le Meridien should be ensuring that their standards do not continue to suffer as a result- we all know China is the place for cheap labour- whether your name is Nike or Quiksilver- and such obvious disrespect for the local culture, or lack of understanding of it, has lead management to assume that there is only one kind of labour force available in China- which as real travellers know- is untrue; but what Meridien needs to do is hire the cream of the crop as other 5 star hotels in Asia do- because right now Le Royal Meridien in Shanghai is a big, beautiful and modern building with the potential to be world class- the location and the name on the building can attest to that- but the service and attitude of the place is nowhere near the pricetag. Unfortunately the hotel is much like a well paid escort- she is tall and beautiful and expensive and grand- but at the same time she is plastic, shallow, lacking class, character and is devoid of personality. What's the point building a magnificent palace which looks amazing and offers so much, and then fill it with poor staff ? So if you are looking for a nice view, a good location and a fantastic executive lounge, then go for it- just don't expect anyone to care or make you feel welcome. But ifyou are looking for a romantic or welcoming stay with all the trimmings and 15 minutes of fame, then forget about this place. We will never stay in Le Meridien's hotel chain ever again, the service was that poor. We did not once ask for anything out of the ordinary- not once; all we wanted was a standard of service that we paid good money for- and having stayed at many cheaper hotels in Shanghai, I can confidently say that Astor House Hotel, JIA or the Hilton in Shanghai make Le Royal Meridien look like a McDonald's carpark. Obviously I have failed in my attempt to be subtle here, so I will end with a couple of suggestions; if you are a business man or lady who does not intend to leave the hotel other than for business, who doesn't need the 5 star service that Le Meridien promises, who is happy with the executive club privileges (which are fantastic) and likes to be a faceless guest with no fuss, then this hotel may just scrape through for you. But only just. If you have any respect for your family, girlfriend or wife who you are travelling with- then choose somewhere else.We are not nightmare guests, not anal, overly sensitive or smug; nor are we young yuppies who are scorned by one bad experience. We had no real expectations other than to be served well and we intended to have the carefree holiday we had dreamed about: taxi's everywhere, romantic dinners and drinks, a welcoming smile each day and to hear the occasional &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;hello Mr and Mrs C..&quot; but the consistent disappointment on many levels across many employees and several nights cannot be ignored- when a hotel can't even send up a couple of menus or wait until we are out of earshot before talking smack, then it isn't exactly 5 star service, is it ?we chose this hotel based on TA reviews, just make sure you really research hard before choosing a hotel. We read many reviews over a few months, and you can tell when someone is just picky or is looking for something wrong with the place- but as a young newlywed couple we were prepared to make the best of any situation no matter how bad; we paid ig dollars and had to really try hard to not let the poor service get to us,and we treated every day as new - still had a blast as honeymooners do- but several times a day we found ourselves saying &quot;I can't believe that just happened...&quot; We were waiting for Ashton Kutcher to jump out at any time. A shame really. Most of the time, the service barely scraped through.Look elsewhere. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"My choice hotel in Shanghai...VERY IMPRESSED! I just left the LRM Shanghai today and I must say that my friends and I had an extraordinary time! We stayed in a Royal Club level room with Executive Royal Club Lounge access for 6 nights. Every morning, we had breakfast (made to order eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pastries, dim sum, sushi, congee, fruit, cereal...) in the club lounge and surfed the web using the free wifi and whenever possible, we had glasses of wine and snacks (bread, cheese, sushi, dim sum, sandwiches, fruit, carpaccio...) during happy hour. If you did not purchase a royal club level room, I believe you can upgrade for 450 RMB per night. It's totally worth it since you get a room on a higher level, free wifi, breakfast, all you can drink alcohol and food. You can also opt to have breakfast at Le Bistrot in the lobby area where you can get a wider selection but no wifi and it can get a bit busy. The rooms only come in king or 2 twins and since there were 3 of us for 3 of the 6 nights, they added a rollaway bed for 245 RMB per night. Housekeeping and turndown service was great and they NEVER rushed you at all but whenever we get back to the room, it was ALWAYS made up and amenities and towels were ALWAYS topped up - unless of course we turned on the &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; light. The rollaway bed made the room a little cramped but no other complaints otherwise. The decor is extremely modern and in my opinion, quite opulent with marble bath floors and tub, separate toilet room and frosted frameless glass doors. The bath tub area has a rain shower coming out of the ceiling! The bath products are from L'Occitane. The beds were so comfortable I just fell asleep as soon as got under the soft down duvet/comforter! The hotel staff were incredible - always smiling, always going out of their way to speak English and push elevator buttons for you even riding down and escorting you to wherever you're headed. The concierge spoke perfect English and always knew to recommend restaurants. Prior to arriving in Shanghai, I had emailed the concierge desk to make recommendations and reservations at restaurants, bars, lounges and clubs. The cabs in Shanghai don't speak English and will not usually recognize English names of places so make sure you ask the concierge or the door/bell staff to write the Chinese address for you. They have these address cards which they will give you with the hotel Chinese name and address for the return trip - just show the card to the driver and they will know where to take you. You should just remember that almost EVERYTHING in China is negotiated. The posted price for the hotel car service from the hotel to Pudong Airport is normally 600 RMB, but we negotiated a shopping trip AND the airport for 400 RMB! The driver waited for us while we shopped! A cab to the airport in non-rush hour traffic is around 150 RMB but we ended up with 7 pieces of luggage after 7 days of shopping so we wanted to just take the hotel car - which is a very clean and nice black Audi. When we arrived at the airport today, a LRM Shanghai representative met us at the drop off location and escorted us and pushed our luggage to the appropriate counter and assisted with our check-in process. He spoke very good English. All in all, LRM Shanghai MADE my 1st Shanghai experience and they delivered every expectation I had of a 5 star hotel - I will definitely be back! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Recommended Excellent hotel in a perfect location.We had a nice Club Room and Club Lounge is really perfect. The views of Pudong at sunset are breathtaking, while you enjoy a very good free buffet. Great breakfast, superb overall experience "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Terrible attitude and service I was hoping for a good stay when visiting the Le Meridien given so many positive recommendations. I have NEVER been to a hotel with so arrogant personnel and service. As CEO of a major corporation, I am used to high service level and attention to detail. I have been very pleased with my stay at the Sofitel in Shanghai. Will never go back to Le Meridien. I am so disappointed, as the Le Meridien in several other cities is very good, but the personnel does not know what service is at this hotel, and also speak vey poor English. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel and Location We recently stayed here, twice. Everything about the hotel was wonderful--rooms, bathrooms, service, check-in and location. The elevators were not an issue. Yes, you have to take one to the lobby and then one to your room. But they're quick, and if you're reasonably high up, the view is great. We loved the place. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"a great hotel spoilt by checkin This was to be the highlight of the trip as far as hotels, but upon arrival the king bed was not available and even though we paid for an upper floor 43 plus we were allocated the 24th floor. despite requests for this to be sorted out it was refused. They offer a happy hour drinks but be aware this is only for some drinks and you have to order the same drink. On the 66th floor bar we were offered the city view even though the Bund view was vacant .Despite the negatives we would stay there again "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Perfect choice for first trip to Shanghai Picked this hotel because of reviews on TA and I also found a cheap deal from CX Holidays for September. Wasn't disappointed - the hotel was modern and well designed, room wasn't particularly big but comfortable, didn't have any problems with the service (all queries dealt with competently and politely). There was some confusion about their bar opening times, and they weren't as accomodating as I would encounter in some other hotels) but it wasn't really a major issue for us. Breakfast buffet was great, as it had loads of choices and some local cuisine available. Location also could not be better.For us, it was a great choice for its location and good all round facilities. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great hotel in a very convenient location I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August in room number 2714. The location of this hotel can't be beat as it is in the middle of a busy area with the clean Shanghai subway station just steps away. My particular room was a corner room which provided for windows on both sides of the room with great views of what was going on at street level. Unfortunately, my view of the Shanghai World Financial Center was blocked by the building next to the hotel, but there was still plenty to look at otherwise. The room itself was incredible and had a ton of amenities. There was a big closet area to the left as you first walked in which was perfect for my oversized bags. The beds were very comfortable and were definitely some of the softest beds that I slept on in China. This was the beginning of a very long trip for me and I found that the beds in all of the other hotels were uncomfortably firm which must had appealed more to the Chinese people. The bathroom was very big and spacious, however it provided no privacy as it was completely enclosed in transparent glass. If you are staying with a spouse this is no problem, but if you are staying with a friend it might provide some privacy issues. The TV and internet worked just fine as far as I could tell, but I wasn't really concerned with this as I was only staying in Shanghai for 2 nights and wanted to see as much as I could see. Be prepared to pay a hefty fee for internet access and also be prepared to be blocked out from all of the social networking sites (facebook, youtube, etc.) as China uses a firewall to make sure that you don’t access these sights. I didn’t use the pool, but still went to see what it looked like anyways. If I would have had more time at the hotel, than I definitely would have used the pool as it was a nice and big indoor pool with a great view of the outside. The lobby was enormous and had many restaurants to choose from. I ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant on the last morning and found it to be good, but very expensive. However, it was nice to have an American breakfast after experiencing the traditional Chinese breakfast. Overall, I would definitely have to give this hotel a very high rating as it was in an excellent location and the rooms were of very high quality. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good hotel but not the service We stayed at this hotel in the second week of August for 6 nights. Our reasons for picking this hotel were:1. The location 2. The reviews on TAIn terms of the location, for us it was ideal. We could just walk out of the hotel and there were many shops, resturants etc aroundd just a nice place to be.The hotel was very modern, we loved that aspect, the rooms were very nice and our bund view the cherry on top. However, the service was poor, actually very poor!!!We stayed at many hotels around Asia and the service here has to be the worst. The staff lacked manners and really didn't seem interested in doing anything.Would we stay here again, yes if the price was reasonable but my preference would be to try a different hotel. Would we recommend the hotel to friends - yes because we really liked the rooms and hotel itself, including the pool. But again we would stress the point about the service.If the hotel service is a big part of your hotel experience then we would not recommend this hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good Modern Hotel I stayed here on a business trip to Shanghai and was pleasantly surprised by the hotels modern interior which I prefer. I did not have a chance to explore the hotel so I can only comment about the room and service. The room was nicely done and well equipped though on the smaller side. The bathroom has an open to the room design which is fine if you are travelling alone. The room was comfortable and modern at the same time. I was very pleased with the service of the hotel. I asked the bellboy who brought up my luggage to get me a local sim card. Within 15 minutes he delivered it to my room and even installed it in my phone. I was impressed. The location is also great, right in the middle of the city. Everything that you need is just a walk away. Enjoy. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Like the curates egg......good in parts. Our rate enabled us to use the Royal Club Lounge, on the 44th floor, which has breath-taking views of Shanghai. The Lounge has its own dedicated check in desk and provides an excellent breakfast as well as soft drinks, snacks, tea and coffee during the day. Appetisers and complimentary alcoholic drinks are available between 5.30 and 7.30 pm. Food and drink were excellent in both quality and range, served by attentive, willing staff. Free wireless internet in the Lounge was also a great bonus. Having used 'Club' lounges in Renaissance, Accor and St Regis hotels, I have no hesitation in saying that the Meridien's Royal Club is the best I have come accross. Unfortunately, the remainder of our experience was less favourable. Our luggage was delivered by security staff posing (somewhat ineptly) as bell hops and another 'bell hop' followed me around after check in. Difficult to know why? Presumably my face (or its colour) didn't fit in with the Royal Meridien's 'profile'. The Concierges were also a mixed bunch: one was extremely helpful when my wife enquired about a trip, but another gave the impression that he was doing me a favour, when asked for assistance. Both the corridor on our floor and the room itself had a damp musty smell, which we reported but recieved no response.The wrong rate was applied to our bill at checkout resulting in an overcharge in excess of RMB 2000. Not a big deal but, despite providing proof of the correct rate for our booking, (inexcusably) took nearly 20 mins to resolve.Overall the Royal Meridien is a big, brash, rather impersonal, hotel which, like the curates egg, is good in parts. It's deficiencies were highlighted by the exceptional service we recieved during our stay at the St Regis in Beijing (during the same trip). The Royal Meridien's location was the deciding factor in choosing a hotel in Shanghai but, despite the attractions of Royal Club, it's likely that we will make a different choice next time time round. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Review from a travel professional Great location, next to the main shopping street. The room was a bit small but very well equipped and modern. Only negative point was the Concierge. When we asked for sightseeing information he just gave us the brochure of the local sightseeing operator and asked us to do our own research. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"A new favorite in Shanghai Stayed for a few nights on business - and was highly impressed with the service and the amenities although I was slightly disappointed with the business center mainly because of their nickling &amp; diming for everything (surprised they did not charge me for the oxygen they provided while using their service)... Other than that, I have no complaints... the hotel is very lovely. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"A great hotel with perfect view I’ve been to the city before but this is my first time to stay in this hotel. Without any doubt, this is a superb hotel. The hotel is located just next to the high street of the town and you can easily get to major scenic spots and entertaining areas. The view outside of my room was stunning, thanks to its great location. I can overview the whole Nanjing Street standing in my room. And it is also very enjoyable to have drinks at their bar at 66th floor. Doesn’t matter what drinks you have, it is nice to enjoy yourself in such a chic and cool bar (with great views also). They have quite a lot of elevators and you’d better make sure you are not getting yourself lost… I tried their Chinese restaurant as there is no point to have French food during my Shanghai trip. The service is good and food is with fair prices. If you are looking for a hotel with great location and outstanding value, this Le Meridien Shanghai is where you should go. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great value. Great location. Great service. Selected this hotel since it was rated #1 of 1500 or so hotels in Shanghai and couldn't argue with the price (about 130 quid per night for three). Buffet breakfasts excellent (as are buffet dinners - Tue and Fri BBQ dinner with all the beer you can drink for about 22 quid). I'd call that a loss leader. Half price for kids.Hotel meticulously clean, staff very helpful and speak good English which is lucky because I only learned the word for 'Hello' between Bahrain and Shanghai. And that's it for my Chinese. Hotel organised train tickets etc as necessary which avoids taking hours out of your day to buy a ticket to the wrong place at the wrong time and the wrong day.Well located - next to People's Park which is good for subway to Shanghai South train station, centre of town and Longyang Station (for Maglev to Pu Dong airport). Maglev is outstanding gig. Surreal barrelling along at 430km/h. The wierdest bit is that when it stops accelerating at 430km/h it actually feels like the driver has slammed the brakes on. That's how fast it is still accelerating. Eat your heart out Clarkson.Only moan is price of internet access in business centre. 5 Yuan a minute. Err, that's nearly 50p a minute. Thirty quid an hour. Are you sure?Hotel is actually a converted office block apparently which is why there are all manner of lift changes required depending on which floor your room is on. Takes some getting used to.Views from top floor bar outstanding. Arrive early for a window seat. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Superb Hotel From the moment you arrive at the hotel you will find the service to be of a very high standard.We had originally booked a club room, but as this is not the peak season there are quite a few deals to be had, and well worth investigating before you travel. We were upgraded to an Imperial Suite on the 59th floor. It was lovely with a bathroom overlooking the business district and the main bedroom and seperate living room overlooking the Peoples square.The lift system can be a bit confusing but that was probably my only critisism of the hotel.The hotel is ideally located if you want to shop and just walk around the area. Unfortunately on one day the temperature reached 41.C and a red alert was issued. So the hotel was a nice cool oasis when you got back. One reason for visiting Shanghai was for the Eclipse of the Sun. Unfortunately it started raining but it was still stunning being outside and watching everything go dark at 9.45am.There is a good choice of restaurants including Italian, Chinese, French and a Buffet style. But if you want the Buffet then arrive early or book.Overall it was a lovely trip and we used Shanghai as a base to also visit Xian for the Terracotta warriers and also Hangzhou.I would certainly highly recommend this hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Ideal Location The hotel's ideal location makes it a must for anyone short on time. There is so much sightseeing and shopping within walking distance that we were exhausted from walking. It clearly is the best Meridien hotel in which I have stayed. The structure of the hotel is so large that it is sometimes difficult in navigating. The concierge desk is not marked as such and I still am not sure if I used the concierge or luggage assistance personnel for information. They were extremely helpful though. An unusual feature is that the hotel gives you a card with the taxi's identification on it when you take a taxi from the hotel. This is great in case you leave something in the taxi or have a complaint. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Think elevators...as you'll be spending a long time waiting for them! Before I get on to the negative points, there were some good things about this hotel....- lovely rooms: modern, slick, bright, good size, good views, good ameneties, etc- health club: big, clean, great gym, nice spa- location: great if you want to be near where its all at in terms of shopping, business, etcAnd the negatives:- Structure of the hotel. Here's the scenario: I was offered an upgrade (for a fee) to a junior suite, which was to include access to the club floor and all the perks associated with that. However, the junior suite is basically a differently shaped room to a normal room (in that its on the corner of the hotel) but the room is pretty much exactly the same size. The suite I was offered was on the 37th floor (of which there are 66 floors). The club floors are located from around 55 to 60. If I had accepted the room, this would have been my daily voyage:- take a life from the ground floor to the 20th floor where the lobby is- take another lift from the lobby floor to the 37th floor to get to your room- fancy using the cub floor? Well then take a lift back down to the 20th floor- then take another lift to the club floor. Fancy going from there to the gym? Ok, well you'll need to get your stuff in your room so:- take a lift from the club floor, to the 20th floor, and another from the 20th floor to the 37th floor, and then go back to the 20th floor to get another lift to the 10th floor (different from all the other 3 lifts you've already taken!) to get to the spa- etc etc etcThe number of different elevators also means that if you ask for anything, like a card to access wifi, then you have to wait for the staff to work through the myriad of elevators also! (yes, you can't just sign up for wifi from your room....its a costly 100 RMB which needs to be ordered from the business centre, and the staff have to bring the code personally to your room and you have to sign for it). A lot of people have mentioned the breakfast buffet. Yes I admit that the food is nice, but the buffet restaurant is like a mad house. literally 100s of people, swarming around. Service is slow (e.g. if you want coffee) and its probably one of the least attractive and relaxing places I have ever had to have breakfast in!The service is good...but nothing above and beyond what I'd experienced elsewhere in China (a country where I find service excellent)Overall, its a modern, massive hotel, in a good location. You can't fault the rooms, the spa, or the top floor bar....but i'll be going for somewhere slightly less 'mass production line' next time "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Perfect Hotel Stay! We stayed 7 nights at the Royal Meridien, and we loved it. This was our first time ever to China, so the central location of the hotel in Shanghai near multiple metro exits, people's square, museums and shopping was great. Staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful and accomodating to all our needs. We upgraded to the Executive Lounge status, which included free breakfast/afternoon tea/snacks, and cocktails/appetizers in the evenings + free internet access - this saved us tons of money and time, so convenient. The gym was amazing, new equipment and machines, very clean and a huge indoor pool / jacuzzi area.The Chinese restaurant at the hotel was moderately priced and AMAZING, we were really blown away at the superb quality for the fair prices. Beautiful setting too, overlooking the city. The french restaurant was good quality, but we did not like the selection of the 4-course menu - why the chef included 3 seafood items and no meats is beyond me for a French menu. If you go here order ala carte. The exectutive lounge staff recommended another nearby Chinese restaurant - Jade Garden in the Porsche building - that was also amazing and even more affordable, we were the only Anglos there and had no challenges finding the restaurant or ordering - may have been the best Chinese food we've ever had (except the Sweet/Sour Pork at the Le Meridien restaurant was spectacular!!).Nearby shopping at all price points is everywhere, or hop the very clean and easy metro or taxis to other shopping areas. The lotus pond in people's square was stunning, a must see that is right across the street! Yu Garden was 3-RMB ($1.50 usd?) and had tons of shopping in ancient city setting, side streets and excellent dumplings - 15 pork dumplings for about $1.50 USD. Side streets with food vendors like those you see on the Travel/Food Network shows, very fun. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel all round Just returned from four nights at theLe Meridien Hotel and found the position,service,Rooms,and Food all to be of excellent standard.I stayed in a junior suite on the 36th Floor overlooking the peoples square and the room was perfect with all the amenities available from a large Plasma TV that rotates to face the Bed or the Lounge to a large Bathroom with a huge showerhead.Breakfast was a highlight with the most amazing Buffet available.In fact lunch and dinner also offered outstanding Buffet selections.The staff all speak english and are always friendly and asking if you need assistance.The Bar on the 66th floor is a great place to have a drink and watch all the lights come on around the city at night.Overall could not recommend this Hotel highly enough and its deserves its number one ranking on trip advisor for Shanghai Hotels. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Very Modern Hotel - Small Rooms Stayed here in October 2008 with family. Not the ideal hotel for staying with family. Rooms are small and if you request 2 beds, they stiff you with 2 twin beds. Rooms were very modern and well kept. Windows are big and give quite a view of the city. Location was descent as it was located right on Nanjing Road. Wireless internet was not available in the rooms. Had to go to the business center located on another floor. Not very convenient for a hotel catered to business travelers. The sink is outside of the bathroom. No counter in the bathroom to put your clothes on. Also there the bathroom window is transparent with a pulldown curtain. Good hotel for couples and business travelers. Pick another hotel if traveling with family. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Great breakfast buffet Just your average great hotel. The one thing that stood out was the quality of the food at the breakfast buffet. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Ultra modern hotel Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, a perfect place to spend our last couple of days in China. We had been picked up at the airport by a guide, who knew her way around, otherwise we might have struggled with check-in as it isn't at ground level. You also need to concentrate to make sure you use the correct lift, as they don't all go to the same floors. The room was great, with floor to ceiling windows, a massive television on the wall and a fantastic glass bathroom. Not sure what other reviewers meant about the door to the bathroom, it was frosted glass, and certainly not see-through.The pool area was very clean, and the pool quite large and a perfect temperature.The breakfast was outstanding, probably the best I have ever had. The choice was amazing. On our first morning we were led to a table in a rather dark part of the restaurant, we asked if we could sit nearer to the windows, and to start with they said that none were available. I noticed an empty table and they somewhat reluctantly moved us.The business centre charged 50p per minute for the internet which I think is too expensive, even for an upmarket hotel.The fruit juice and iced water in reception was a nice touch, and the &quot;turn-down&quot; service always asked if we wanted extra waters.Overall a very good hotel, which I would hope to revisit sometime. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Location a little pricey huge breakfast buffett Just stayed here one night on a trip mostly to other parts of China. hotel was very nice and location is great. No problems with the hotel. Great view from my room, although room was a little small the outside wall was a big window, so made it feel bigger. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Location luxury and tip top service! I recently stayed at Le Meridien Shanghai and I must say I was overwhelmed with the granduer of the property as well as the personal service offered. Before I arrived I emailed Concierge at the hotel to arrange a train ticket from Shanghai to Beijing, different class options were offered and the tickets were waiting on my arrival......... very smooth and reassuring that I didn't have to try and do it myself on arrival in Shanghai. The hotel is very impressive (brand new, maybe 2 years old), the building itself is one of the tallest in Shanghai and located perfectly at the end of Nanjing Road (walking/shopping street) and across the road from Peoples Park. The subway is 100metres from the hotel and taxis are plentiful. The breakfast at the hotel was amazing and it was very nice to receive an &quot;illy&quot; coffee at breakfast to start the day. The indoor swimming pool and gymnasium was the perfect place to end a mad day of shopping in Shanghai........ the hotel is the perfect sanctuary after battling with the masses on the streets. Would definitely stay at Le Meridien Shanghai again........ both the staff and the building are top notch! "

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fabulous! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 1 week. It was by far one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. The rooms are very modern, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast is amazing and will satisfy any palate. Great location - right on Nanjing Rd. and very close to the metro. The people, shops, and food are right at your doorstep. Service was excellent - the staff even took the time to show me how to use my local cell phone. The royal meridien made our stay in Shanghai that much better. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Ultra Modern Shanghai I have recently started traveling into Shanghai. My Travel Agent recommended this hotel. It has a great location near the People Square and on the Bund side. I originally thought it was on the Bund by my agents description, but it isn't. It is high enough to see the Bund area and into the very modern Pudong. The views at night are stunning.There are a few strange qwerks with the hotel. I could never figure out which elevators I needed to ride up to my floor. I did have to change elevators at least two time for each journey. I also didn't understand why there were sounds of nature in the lobby (birds chirping).Overall it was an enjoyable stay. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fabulous modern hotel in the heart of Shanghai We loved Le Royal Meridien in Shanghai. The building itself is stunning and can be seen from all over the city and Pudong. Staff - wonderful - polite, really helpful; room - spacious, stylish, spotless - I love the fact that the glass bathroom is part of the room and also LOVE the floor to ceiling windows with the most spectacular views of the city over to Pudong. Breakfast was superb - a staggering choice of food from around the world served in smart surroundings. Note: we ate in one of the hotel restaurants (Chinese food) and the service wasn't great but the food was good (although it all arrived at different times which was a bit frustrating!). Also the bar has stunning views and is very slick - but again the service wasn't brilliant. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Absolutely gorgeous! We stayed four nights at Le Royal Meridien Shanghai and loved every moment. Our room was small but with the most stunning view imaginable of Shanghai. Truly spectacular. The hotel's location is fantastic -- right in the heart of the city -- and the decor reminded me of a stylish modern art deco. The staff was helpful, and the restaurants were very good. After all of our trekking and sightseeing, I booked a massage at the spa, and it was probably the best massage I have ever had. My husband and I still talk about how fabulous this hotel is. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"The best Le Meridien in the world This is the best Le Meridien I have ever stayed at. The club lounge was amazing, all the restaurants are fantastic, the staff if wonderful. Be sure to have a drink at the bar on the top floor - the views are stunning at night. This is a 5-star hotel in Shanghai - can't imagine anything better. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great hotel in great location but inadequate facilities I've stayed in a few properties in Shanghai and for the rooms this is one of the best. Location is superb as well, for tourism, being on the corner of Renmin Square and Nanjing East Road, easy access to metro. From the hotel to the metro I only got asked a couple of times if I wanted a fake Rolex which is pretty good compared to Nanjing East Road.The negative point for me was the breakfast. The first morning (a Sunday) the buffet restaurant was full and after waiting a few minutes in a queue I was taken to an additional area around the corner from the lobby area which had an inferior atmosphere and a reduced selection of breakfast offerings. The second morning I had the normal breakfast and it was absolutely superb with much more variety. If breakfast is important to you, insist on sitting in the main area. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Place to Stay Good Ambience, good place to stay for business / events.If you are on a leisure trip to shanghai then you need to find hotels which are closer to shopping places &amp; tourist attractions. "

Very accessible to the most department stores in Nanjing.Concierge was very helpful and knowledgable about where to go and what to do in Shanghai. Most of them speak good English as well.One drawback is that wi-fi is not free. Housekeeping service is quite slow was well... maybe because its almost fully booked hotel. Breakfast has a very wide selection... from smoked salmon appetizer to canape to egg benedict. I would love to stay in this hotel again! 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent hotel in great location I just returned from a 4 day stay in Shanghai during Easter. I think the Le Royal Meridien Shanghai is a decent choice.LOCATION : The hotel is located in the centre of Shanghai, next to the Nanjing West Rd Shopping street and several malls including Raffles City. The People's Square subway station is below it. The location cannot be better and is much more convenient for tourists than Pudong or Xujiahui. Costs RMB140 by taxi from Pudong airport.ROOMS: The design is ultra modern and is very comfortable. The view from the room is spectacular. The bed is comfortable. I appreciate the l'Occitane toiletries. SERVICE: Excellent except for the waiters at the Chinese restaurant, who are rather aloof. Most staff speaks good English and are helpful and thoughtful. Check-in and concierge are efficient on the whole.BREAKFAST : Excellent with wide range of choice and as good as any hotel in Asia. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good not great. I stayed a night at this hotel in April 2009. As an SPG Platinum member I was given a Royal Club room. While the view was good, I was disappointed with the size and layout of the room. This all-glass bathroom is effectively part of the room itself. I was also surprised to find wi-fi chargeable even in the Royal Club lounge. The lounge itself was nice and spacious, but not outstanding compared to other SPG lounges in Asia I've visited, including Westin Bund Centre, Westin Kuala Lumpur, Le Meridien Kuala Lumpur.All-in-all, I was disappointed with my stay given the good reviews and ranking. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Landmark hotel on East Nanjing Road with best breakfast buffet The architecture of this hotel is very striking. When you come towards East Nanjing road, you really can't miss it. The service is good and the staff speaks decent English. The rooms are nice but the best thing about this hotel is the breakfast buffet. We've got a good deal with Hotels.com and paid EUR 125 (including breakfast) so that was a very good deal. The only bad thing of the hotel is the high charge for using the internet (EUR 1 per 2 minutes). But since internet is only available in the top hotels, you don't have much choice. If you like shopping, then East Nanjing Road is the place to be. I personally like the French Concession more because I like the nice little boutiques and the best restaurants are situated there. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"location We chose this hotel for our two night quick visit to Shanghai for a few reasons. First, coming from the Pudong airport, we wanted to experience the Maglev (overrated but a must do for our kids). The Maglev connects easily with a direct subway to the hotel. Just be sure to look for the East Nanjing exit from the subway which puts you in front of the hotel. Second, the subway outside the hotel was also a direct shot up to Circus World, were we saw ERA ( a highly recommended acrobat show.) Next, the hotel is close to the Shanghai Museum. Unfortunately, we did not expect such long admission lines on a Sunday morning, so we ended up with not enough time to visit. Also, right outside our door was East Nanjing Street. On a Saturday night at 10 PM in March, it felt like Times Square on speed! The 20 minute walk up to the Bund, and the Bund itself, was so dynamic. We could really feel the bounding pulse of Shanghai.. And lastly, just a few blocks away from the hotel were two great local dumpling restaurants, Jia Jia Tang Bao (soup dumplings) and Yangs (fried dumplings) on Huanghe Road. So you see, Le Royal Meridien was all about location. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"I would like to give this a 5 star review but I can't Le Royal Meridien has a great location next to Nanjing Lu, the main shopping street in Shanghai. The building is a magnificent building, and (on a rare clear day) many rooms have wonderful views over Shanghai and Pudong across the river. The hotel is clean, the bedrooms are comfortable and well equipped, and the dining facilities are good.However, certain features of this hotel make it impossible to call it a 5-star facility.First, the hotel apparently inactivates room keys at their whim on your departure date - even when (in my case) a late check out had been arranged, and the hotel was aware of the time of departure with a car booked to the airport. Second, if you complain about this practice, the front desk staff pretend that no manager is available to talk &quot;right now&quot;. (Only when I started talking about contacting their general manager, did the front desk manager suddenly appear.) Third, the business centre charges prices that I have not seen for simple tasks in 50 similar hotels around Asia. Fourth, the hotel is not well signposted internally - for example, for the different lift lobbies required to get from ground to the lobby level, and then on to bedroom floors of the hotel. Finally, although the food served in the restaurants is of high standard, the training of the waiting staff is not - with odd reactions to requests for simple beverages, plates whisked away before the food on them was consumed, and coffee and tea that leave you yearning for the nearby Starbucks. If you want to see downtown Shanghai, this hotel definitely has an unbeatable location - but nearby (in my experience) are many hotels with better attitudes to service, just as good views, and highly acceptable room and food standards. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Really great hotel. We stayed here for a weekend and it was really everything we expected it to be. Large, clean rooms with amazing views of Shanghai. the bed was nice and comfy and there was a plasma screen TV attached to the wall. The bathroom had a big bath and a nice shower set-up. The internet was a little pricey for Chinese standards, but I didn't really need it so i wasn't bothered. The breakfast was excellent and the service was almost too good. The second any waste appeared on the table the staff was right there to pick it up. It almost got comical. I don't mind a little mess on the table but it was nice to have it cleared. Whenever I got up to get something I always came back to my serviette refolded and placed on the table. The choices of food was outstanding. The staff are very helpful. The doormen always got taxis for us and made sure the driver knew exactly where we wanted to go. Overall the Royal Meridien is a good choice. It may be a bit pricey compared to other hotels in the area, but you get what you pay for. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"The worst Starwood hotel I have ever stayed I stayed in Shanghai a few times (for business and travel respectively) but it was the worst experience I have ever had with a hotel here.I requested to have a double-bed non-smoking room when I booked. But when I checked in the reception just told me that they had only twin bed room left. They did not offered me any other asisstance until I asked her to check and she said there was one double-bed smoking room. Seems like they don't care about the customer's requirement at all. And when I requested to speak to the manager, the manger came out and simply repeated the same thing and told me that they now just had a double-bed smoking room or twin-bed non-smoking room. The point is their attitude is cool and indifferent.Although one can easily see that this hotel works very hard to appear to come with a lot of artistic elements and modern style, the room is not up to a 5 star hotel standard as well. The paper coasters were used and the tap water smells even after boiling. Their lifted hangers were not working properly.The only advantage is it is located just above the busy shopping street and in the centre of CBD.Their entrance is not very convenient as well - you would have to take lifts to the lobby floor and right after you step out from that elevator, you would see a restaurant but not the lobby or reception area. It is quite a maze for first time customer.All in all, it is the indifferent manner of their staff which made me feel not good. I am just a business traveller so I don't expect to have very warm welcoming staff, but at least hotel staff with caring for the customers would be something I expect. I think there are a lot of good hotels in town than this one. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Spectacular and in just the right spot to get to know Shanghai! Amazing service and beautiful, ultra-modern rooms and services. From the minute we arrived, the service was exceedingly welcoming and efficient. the views are wonderful. The restaurants are wonderful. The motif is hyper modern but warm with beautiful Asian decorations. It's in the middle of a bustling area with many choices of restaurants, shopping or cultural sites. The location is perfect, just two blocks from Peoples (or Renmin) Square and the Shanghai Musem. The major pedestrian shopping street is literally out the front door and a few steps to the left. You can walk all the way down to the Bund and the river in an easy stroll of about 30-45 minutes taking moments to shop or gawk at the Chinese dancing or doing their Tai-chi work in the pocket parks on the way. It's a wonderful place at a great price.... superb value. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent hotel We stayed at Royal Meridien for a weekend and loved it. The location is excellent. The staff was discreet, friendly and helpful. The room was well equipped, spotlessly clean and with excellent views. We requested a non-smoking room and got it, there was not a trace of smell. The bed is very comfortable. Be aware that the bathroom design is a bit unusual (see-through glass between bathroom and main room (why? - so you can see the TV from the bathtub, of course), but with non see-through glass for the toilet and shower) so it would not be comfortable to share a room with e.g. a colleague, but it is well suited for a family or a romantic get-away. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good choice for Shanghai We stayed at the Le Meridien for 5 nights using Starwood points, so it was a good deal for us. Since I have platinum status, we were upgrade to a suite, with access to the lounge. Our first suite had some terrible smell, so we went downstair to get a new room. After some brief confusing at the front desk, it was quickly done. And the concierge brought up the luggage to the new room. Overall, good hotel! Definitely worth the stay, will stay there again. There are definitely pro/con to this hotel:Pro: Good location off Nanjin Road. If you get a high floor room, you get to have an amazing view. Since we were there in the summer, view somewhat questionable with the smog. The metro station is across the street, just have to remember which exit to take off when getting out of the metro, or you might end up at the other side of the park. Pro: Suite was HUGE, with floor to ceiling window. The room also came with laundry bags (not the crappy plastic kind), shoe cover bags, shopping bag, slippers, robes, hot tea pot, daily bottled water. House keeping was super.. .we never see them in the hall but our room was always clean upon return. The bathroom was big and spacious, came with everything you need on the road. Pro: Lobby is beautiful, so is the building. Love the modern decor, fresh flowers, overall design is impressive. Pro: The guys handling the cab line at the front of the hotel knew all the places we need to go, and they seem very organized. Con: It is total mis-management in the prefer guest concierge lounge. Why would they have to &quot;seating&quot; you for breakfast (first time experiencing that in any hotel prefer guest lounge, Asia or US). Since they &quot;serve&quot; you (it's buffet style for food) in the lounge, good luck getting coffee/tea (you have to ask for that) or flag down any of the 20 young people that work there. Only one of the six computers in the lounge had internet connection during our stay... so what's the point of having six computers? Since I speak the local Shanghai dialect, caught some of them talking about the guests there (not very professional, is it?) Con: perhaps too many people work there? There were two people that stand in the lobby level and push elevator buttons for guests -- that's their entire job! Getting out of the cab, at least 3 to 4 people standing there to greet you... (mind you, not helping you with the bags, just to GREET you.. there are other people that help with luggage, etc.). as mentioned, too many people &quot;working&quot; in the lounge. The weird thing is you NEVER see housekeeping anywhere in the hotel, but the hotel is spotless. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Over-rated for a 5 star hotel My husband and I stayed in the hotel from 5th Jan to 10th Jan 2009. I had 5 star expectations of this hotel after reading the numerous reviews and also after we had just stayed at the 5star Hotel Intercontinental Financial Street Beijing.However, the hotel disappointed if you are expecting a 5star hotel. Front desk met our request for a high floor. We stayed on the 35th floor (a starwood preferred guest floor, it seemed). The room was ok, with a plasma tv and nice toiletries. The sink area opens out to the main area eg there isnt a door for the entire bathroom. Could be due to space constraints so that more can be fitted into the room? The bed had a springy sound. The worksmanship for the finishing and fixtures were quite poor - you can see the silicon plastering, etc. The bedside LED lamp was not working properly and the shower handle (metal portion) looked like it was coming off. The first night, there was a funny smell around the bathroom area. Housekeeping came around with a spray and the entire room smelled like a scrubbed toilet for a while. In addition, throughout my stay, there was a constant knocking sound which disturbed my sleep. The good part was that it was clean with some interesting features (a pulldown clothes hanger, neatly tucked power sockets, etc).In room dining / room service was ok and some food items were not bad. I asked for chilli with my sandwich and no tomatoes for my sandwich. They remembered the tomato and forgot the chilli (which they brought the second time). Breakfast looked good from the beginning but became a bore as the menu was almost the same for the 5 mornings we were there. Some breakfast stations were closed and dishes unreplenished if you arrive at the breakfast area around 10.15am. As a chinese, I did not think the chinese food items in the buffet breakfast was very good. The western food is not bad though. The waitresses walked past our table three times and failed to clear the empty plates on our cluttered table. At that time, there were only three tables left at most. They were more interested in clearing the tables where the guests had left or replacing the towels. (This was before 10.30am). Buffet breakfast closes promptly at 10.30am which is fine. Staying past 10.30pm to finish up your breakfast was an unpleasant experience as they were in a hurry to change over the buffet items (for lunch, I think). Concierge was not that of 5 star quality. He gave standard answers/replies when we asked about a trip to Hangzhou. Front desk seem flustered and took a while to find a review card when I asked for one upon checkout and gave me a slightly worn looking one. Staff was generally not smiling (save for the ones who were directing you to the right lift lobbies).The main good thing about this hotel is that it is in a good location. You can walk to the bund, the Shanghai museum and its surrounding or hop onto the metro. But I cant see it as 5 star, it is more like a 4star trying to be a 5star but the service fails in this aspect. So, i rated it below average (below the average of a 5star hotel). "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Le Royal Meridien Shanghai - not really our style Although we traveled in April, I am finally getting around to posting about our China trip. Normally, we prefer to venture on our own, but for China we decided to take an organized tour. After a lot of research, we chose the Pacific Delight tour company- the 13 Day Golden Route Gold Experience (Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an, Guilin, and Hong Kong). We chose this company based on the small group size and the upgraded hotels. And what a fabulous time we had. The tour was great- there were only twelve people in our group and our guide was efficient and knowledgeable. We stayed in Shanghai for two nights at the Le Royal Meridien. I have to admit that it wasn’t one of my favorite places throughout our trip. There was really nothing wrong with the hotel. It was sleek and decorated in a ultra-contemporary fashion, but it felt kind of cold to us. We wanted to like it better since the reviews were so favorable. The lobby is on the 11th floor and you have to switch elevators to get to your room. The rooms were a good size, but the bathroom/shower are enclosed in glass walls. There is a screen that comes down, but there is no true feeling of privacy even though you really can’t see through the glass. The sink is also on the outside of the bathroom, rather than the inside. This is good if you want to continue getting ready while the other person showers, but it forced you to leave the bathroom to finish. The sink seemed out of place in the rest of the room and there is also no space to put your toiletries down either. The bed frame is wooden and sticks out a bit. I got up one night and I smashed my leg on it, to the point that I still have a mark on my leg. Ouch!Laundry is very expensive. We each (two of us) had a change of clothes laundered and it was over $75. I realize that these are city/Le Royal Meridien prices, but excessive nonetheless for laundry. I suggest that if you are travelling to several cities in China and need laundry, to wait until you get to a smaller town like Xi’an or Giulin. The prices are about a third of what they are in Shanghai. Breakfast was good. It’s very busy for breakfast though and you can get forgotten in the rush. One morning was fine, but the next we had problems getting service. Ensure you get to the lounge the 66th floor (not to be confused with the lounge on the lobby level). The view from the bar on the 66th floor is AMAZING! On a clear evening, you get a fantastic panoramic view of the city. The service at the bar was very good as well.The location is also great! A few steps away and you are in the heart of the Pedestrian Walkway, People’s Park, and People’s Square. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"An Oasis in Shanghai Shanghai is an exciting city that is representative of the “new” China. It is also sprawling, noisy and extremely crowded. It is therefore important to stay in a hotel that is an oasis in this bustling metropolis. I found the Royal Meridian to be a perfect antidote to this chaotic, but exciting city.If you like modern design, this is the hotel for you. If you are a tourist, you couldn’t ask for a better location. It’s right by People’s Square, near a Metro station and lot of shopping and not too far from most of the major tourist attractions. The hotel is about a 20-minute walk to the Bund and a 25-minute walk to the French Concession. This being Shanghai, most attractions are also a cheap cab ride away, as well.Besides the location, these are the things I really liked about the hotel:§ Good security – you have to take the elevator up to the 11th floor for the lobby, plus there is always hotel personnel stationed by any entrance or elevator bank.§ Cheerful, comfortable rooms with the best bed linens I have ever slept on and a 42-inch flat screen TV with a decent selection of English-speaking channels. Great views from the rooms since they are all on higher floors.§ Bathroom has one of the best showers I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. Note that the bathrooms probably don’t offer as much privacy as a more traditionally designed hotel room.§ One of the best hotel pools I’ve ever seen. It’s perfect for swimming laps and they even have kick boards. I didn’t use the gym but it looked excellent.§ Overall, very helpful and friendly staff. The concierge is particularly helpful; I wouldn’t have been able to get around this city without their help.§ Excellent restaurants that are not as outrageously priced as those elsewhere. I ate at the Chinese, Italian, and Buffet restaurant; all were quite good.My criticisms of the hotel are relatively minor.:§ As other reviewers have noted, the elevator system can be confusing at times. However this should not be a major concern.§ Some of the staff at the gym and pool tend to hover over you at times. Maybe this is a cultural thing, but I think they need to be trained that this behavior gets annoying after a while.§ Finally, there is no free Wi-Fi in the rooms or in the lobby. I don’t know if this is standard practice for China, but it would be so convenient at least to have it in the lobby. Note, that you can walk across the street to Costa Coffee, where they have delicious blueberry muffins and free wireless internet.Overall, my stay at Le Royal Meridien was great, and I highly recommend this hotel! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Magnificent hotel I've never written a review of a hotel before, though I've used Trip Adviser numerous times, very successfully, to find them. But this hotel was so outstanding I had to compliment it and recommend anyone visiting Shanghai to choose it. Though not cheap, it was less than many others that came below it in the Trip Adviser, rankings, and the service, location, amenities, views from our room (we were on floor 38) were quite amazing. I knew my daughter and I were in for a great experience the moment we arrived. My daughter had left her passport and other paperwork on the back seat of the taxi from the airport and they immediately said to leave it to them - they would track down the taxi and retrieve her documents. Within an hour, they phoned us in our beautiful room to say it was all on its way to the hotel. A particular bonus was that, though in the heart of busy centre, there was not a bit of noise at night - sealed windows and excellent air conditioning.I've nothing but praise for every aspect of our stay. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Loved the Le Royal Meridien Just came back from our 3 nights stay with Le Royal Meridien , Shanghai. This new &amp; ultra-modern hotel is one of the best hotel I've stayed in. The amenities are the best, staffs are really friendly &amp; helpful, food is good and it's centrally located in the midst of the busy street of Nanjing. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic Hotel From a very fussy traveller, this hotel was an oasis in the middle of a crazy city. If you travel to any of the more un-Westernised areas you realise the joy of hygiene and this hotel has it! We spotted one man cleaning the carpet with a toothbrush!! The staff were beyond lovely on the ground and lobby floors, as with housekeeping. Bit shirty in the fabulous 789 bar on the 66th floor but heck! the views, a bit of 'Lost in Translation'. As usual, my bugbear, cost of drinks in the bar but only because I drink Sauvignon Blanc and the one and only was Cloudy Bay - otherwise Chardonnay was ok and only that available all over Shanghai (n.b. any ABC drinkers).The location was unbelievable, especially for short visits - everything on your doorstep. Concierge full of great ideas for restuarants. All in all a great hotel - we stayed 8 days and loved it. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Good location great views Stayed for 4 nights. We had originally booked a standard room through Starwood but were tempted by the Club Floor facilities (complimentary breakfast, snacks, drinks and internet) and at check in decided to upgrade. The change was handled quickly and efficiently and we found ourselves in a large room on 62nd floor. Great view on clear days! For tourists, a big attraction of the hotel is its location; walking distance to Shanghai's magnificent museum or to the Bund. To anywhere else taxis are cheap and the concierge makes sure the driver knows where to take you. For instance when we left for the airport we wanted to go by Maglev train but taxi driver wanted to take us direct to airport - Meridien staff ensured we got our wish. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"The Good The Bad and The Ugly The GoodGreat views (only from the high floor rooms looking east towards Pudong). Clean functional rooms, comfortable beds.The BadTotal confusion at check-out, when the staff, including the foreign guest relations manager had no idea how to deal with 1 nights charge booked and prepaid through the hotel website and the other nights charge to be paid direct to the hotel. 5 people standing around staring at a computer screen and mumbling and scratching their heads takes something away from the professionalism. Insisting I pay an incorrect invoice and explaining to me the concept of a credit card guarantee at check in (really). Staff needs re-training and educated in the hotel policies. Not a good experience.The UglyThe waitress/attendent in the breakfast room with her finger stuck up her nose.In conclusion it seems 50% of the staff I dealt with have been trained and are somewhat professional....the pleasant girl on the ground floor who would welcome you and press the elevator button, then the next day a different girl who was much more interested in chatting with one of the floor attendents to even notice the guests. Its not that I need elevator buttons pressed but only an example of the other 50% of the staff who have no idea what they are doing or supposed to be doing, seems they are just standing around to fill up space.There are a lot of options in Shanghai maybe better to take your money elsewhere and enjoy accomodation where all the staff (including the foreigners) have been trained to the same standard and service is a little bit more consistent. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great details As a business traveler, I appreciated the details in the hotel room like: lots of multi-country electric plugs, reliable internet access, walk-in rain or hand-held shower, safe big enough to fit lap-tops with plug-ins, do-not-disturb room settings, lots of complementary bottled water, different task lighting, and it was well maintained.One detail that I hadn't seen before was gas mask for &quot;fire safety&quot; in the hotel room.We enjoyed the location of the hotel across from the People's Square, and near the many restaurants along the Nanjing pedestrian mall. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Unbeatable views! It's worth going to Le Royal Meridien, if only for the most interesting thing about Shanghai—the incredible views of the cityscape. It would be a shame to go to the city and not be high-up. This hotel is situated in a huge tower right in the centre of the city and our room was on the 52nd floor. We also opted for a rate, which gave us access to an executive club lounge on the 44th floor and it's something that I'd recommend other travellers to do. You can have breakfast there in relative tranquillity, all-day Internet access, cocktails and nibbles in the evening... and a fantastic panorama that stretches over to the skyscrapers of the Pudong district.We found the hotel's location to be pretty perfect. It's situated right at the heart of the city and is easily within walking district of both the Bund and the old French quarter. The only drawback was actually that you're really in the touristy commercial part of Shanghai and thus, as soon as you step out onto the street, you're accosted by people wanting to sell you &quot;watches, bags, T-shirts...&quot; every ten metres. After we realised this, we often chose to avoid Nanjing Road and to take one of the parallel streets, where there are not so many hawkers.Other than that, our room was perfectly clean and very comfortable. We also tried out the Chinese restaurant, where the service was friendly the food really quite nice. If we ever go back to Shanghai (which is not certain, because we weren't that keen on the actual city), then we'd definitely return to the Royal Meridien. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Nice room great location and comfy bed I spent two nights at the Meridien Shanghai and found it to be an excellent hotel. Its location on Nanjing Road i.e. at the heart of the commercial and shopping district makes it a great hotel for leisure travellers with deep pockets, in addition to business travellers. From the hotel, it is possible to walk to The Bund - Shanghai's renowned promenade. Shoppers can literally drop their bags in their rooms before heading out for another bout of shopping with major malls such as Raffles City within the hotel's vicinity.Checking-in and checking-out of the hotel was a breeze. I did not need to use the business centre due to my short stay. My overall impression - frontline staff were competent without major communication issues, though their smiles do come across as rather plastic, if you know what I mean.My room was very well appointed with plush carpeting, a huge tv and a comfortable king bed that gave me restful slumber for my two nights in the city. I highlight comfortable beds because practically all hotels in China have rock-hard mattresses so falling asleep even for a very tired person takes some effort because it is like lying on benches. The bathroom could have been more luxe in comparison with other Meridien Hotels in Asia, though I was delighted with the spa quality toiletries from L'Occitane. My only gripe was the afternoon sun - still strong at 6pm - shining into my room on the 35th floor. But the mornings and nights are fine, with wonderful views of the cityscape from the picture window in my room. I would return to the Meridien again on subsequent trips primarily because of the central location and the comfortable mattresses - a rarity in China. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"fantastic area I arrived in Shanghai midnight of Sept. 5. My friend and I hailed a taxi from Pudong Airport to the hotel. Upon reaching the hotel, I was ushered to a waiting elevator to go to the lobby. When I approached the receptionist, she already knew my name. probably because it was early morning already. She immediately gave my keys and we were brought to our room. My room was on a lower floor (27th) but it was a corner room. I had my own walk-in closet. the bathtub had a view of the city. Sadly, the Ramada hotel blocked my view of the bund and the skyscrapers in pudong. but my room also had a view of people's park which was not unobsctructed. The concierge is my best friend. They were of tremendous assistance to me. From booking reservations at jean georges, to giving directions on museums, schedules for sunday mass, and even ordering mooncakes! My hats off to jimmy, sandy, edison and to the other guys whose names I have sadly forgotten. My only &quot;bad&quot; comment is that some of their wait staff in the restaurants have a hard time communicating in english. i recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to see the museums since its just a few minutes walk. and nanjing lu road is just in the ground floor for shopping. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Perfect location @Le Royal Meridien I just stayed at Le Royal Meridien on last week (3 Sep), It is my first time to go to Shanghai, as it's a 5 star hotel the price of the room is very expensive so I spend only 1 night at this hotel. It's a 5star hotel so if you talk about the room, it's perfect, the bed, pillow, bathroom, view of the room and especially the stuff or shower gel, shampoo, lotion etc....of course it's L'occitane brand. In the evening around 6 pm the staff will come to you room and do the turn down service for you (prepare the bed+roomor give more water or towels) to sleep. I really love the bathroom which has a bath tub included 2 shower and + 1 shower on the celing which it's like you are standing in the rain. About the location, this has a perfect spot, when you get out from the metro station at People square staion exit at 19 you just look above and you will see the hotel which is very high and has 2 poles on top which this help me when I get lost (while I was shopping in the Nanjing rd) As the building is very high so it's a little bit complicate which I don't really like you have to go up by the elavator to the L floor for the lobby, (it's should be on the first floor only, and you have to see the elevator which one goes to which floor. So you have to change to many elevators. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Scenes of Shanghai I am presently staying at the Royal Meridien in Shanghai. This city is so dynamic; it has changed considerably since my last visit nine months ago. It’s astonishing to watch this city progress into its inevitable future of becoming the world’s capital. The Royal Meridien is located in the heart of the city’s popular Nanjing Road. It’s within walking distance (10 minutes) to The Bund. There are plenty of taxis or public transportation options to take you to the Pearl TV tower and the Shanghai World Financial Centre in nearby Pudong. My suite has a great city view overlooking Nanjing Road and it is well decorated in a modern Asian theme. You might want to ask for two set of key cards when you check in since you will need to insert your key card in a slot inside your room to turn on the A/C, TVs and lights. I personally like my A/C to be running when I leave my room particularly when it is 34 C outside.The walk-in shower has two showerheads and a large marble tub right next to it so bath time is fun time if you can manipulate the showerheads to spray into the tub. The toiletries are well chosen from the L’Occitane En Provence collection. I have been here for four days but I still mystified by the elevator system here. There are four different sets of elevators located in various areas of the hotel. You will need to take two sets of elevators to get to your room. It’s best to have a staff member take you to your room the first time you check in. The most confusing part was getting to the gym/spa/pool. It appears you have to take the lift to the 11th floor (which is the Lobby) walk down a set of stairs to the 10th floor, go through a corridor and take another set of stairs back up to the 11th floor to access the gym area…truly a riddle wrapped inside an enigma. Overall, the hotel is adequate for either business or pleasure. If you are fortunate enough to receive a room or suite on a high floor, the view is hauntingly mesmerizing. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Nice view and interior design Tall enough to have an eagleview. great bed and TV. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel! Could be just a little better. This is a luxury hotel and is very well situated. Very convenient to People's square and on east Nanjing street. Can walk to the Bund. First class hotel. As mentioned by others, the elevators are very confusing until you figure it out. On the club level, the hotel no longer charges for internet use. This could be the direct result of comments made by others on this site so that is an improvement. Two problems I encountered was that the concierge staff were not great. Apparently, this is not an uncommon problem but I found them not all that helpful and their language skills were lacking somewhat. But they did want to sell tours! The other problem I found was that when I booked on the company website, I was under the impression that the final price included taxes and fees and later learned that it did not. This made the price about $50 more per night than I'd thought. Yes, this could definitely have been my own mistake but I look pretty closely at this usually so look out for this. The actual price would have been less if I'd booked through expedia than the hotel's own site. My advice would be to watch out for this. There are other hotels similarly situated such as the Radisson and maybe the JW Marriott so check these prices out too. I would suggest staying in Puxi over Pudong. TIP-if you stay here, check out the bar at the top. While the views are spectacular everywhere, the bar is worth visiting. Very romantic! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic Hotel Stayed the first night in Shanghai at the Four Seasons, which certainly was nice, but this was BETTER. Moved on the advice of a traveling companion (we were there on business) who had stayed at the Le Royal Meridien before. The room was fantastic, with one of the best layouts of a hotel room. The service and attentiveness was at the highest level. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic service and a great hotel I moved to Shanghai in June for 18 months and for the first 3 weeks (before I sorted out a permanent place to live) I was lucky enough to stay at the Royal Meridien downtown Shanghai.It is a superb hotel. The tallest building in the Puxi side of Shanghai. It has fantastic views - especially from the top floor bar (65th floor) and from the Royal Club lounge on the 44th floor.We were staying in an exec. suite which was about 2000RMB per night (300 $ ish). It was a large room - not the largest I've ever stayed in, but had a great big swivel tv (so you can watch in bed, from the sofa or the bath!) and a huuuuuggggeee bed (must be bigger than king size).We got free breakfast in the Royal Club lounge every day, which was good (freshly made eggs, crispy bacon, pastries, fruit, yogurt etc) and free drinks from 5.30 til 8pm every day (including some premium brands like Tanqueray).There is a good gym and pool and the weights and cardio equipment is top notch.The real reason this hotel is so great though is the service (nothing is too much trouble - they even helped us find places to live!) and the location (near People's park and the Bund).Staying here made our move to Shanghai much less stress free than it might have been otherwise.Based on my stay here, I also stayed at the Royal Meridien in Hong Kong, which was just as good. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great location for a very comfortable international-style hotel This is a bland, international hotel but with such a great location and done very well, hence the rating. Right on People's square, the hotel is a landmark building and very easy to find from just about anywhere (just look up). My room was large, with amazing views (on the 52nd floor), floor to ceiling windows, and all the usual luxuries like a posh bathroom, comfortable bed, mini-bar (pricey) and a very large TV (not that there's much to watch on CCTV) . The hotel has a decent swimming pool and leisure club, lots of spa treatments (I didn't try these), a bar at the top (65th floor) and excellent staff who go out of their way to help you. If you can get a good price, go for the 'Royal Club' deals, as you get a room near the top of the hotel, a very good breakfast, free afternoon tea, nibbles and drinks in the evening in a dedicated lounge, and some other bits and pieces.Don't stay here if you want Chinese character and charm - try some of the smaller hotels hidden in the Hutongs.

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Interesting I was speaking at a conference in Shanghai and my wife and I stayed at LRM for four days in early June after reading many accolades on Trip Advisor. The location is great: right next to Nanjing Road, across from People's Park and museums, 10 minutes'walk from the Bund, across from the subway, etc. The building is spectacular. The views are superb. We were in a Club room on the 53rd floor and so took advantage of the breakfast and happy hours, with nice food and drinks that combined western and Chinese styles. Staff were quite helpful, including an excellent concierge service for arranging restaurants and tours. Most of the guests appeared to be business people. Now for a few concerns that lowered our rating: There is no free wi-fi, whether in the rooms or the Club room; this is inexcusable for a top level hotel in today's world. Others have remarked on the dual elevators to get to the upper rooms. Our room, while spacious, had strange design aspects for the contemporary feel. For instance, we could not open just a bathroom light at night, so if one of us used the facilities, the other was woken up by floodlights in the vanity (there are no solid doors). The rainforest shower was nice but not something to write home about. In fact, on the first morning we awoke to no hot water. I had to get to the conference and so washed up rather unsatisfactorily. My wife stayed behing and called the front desk. They sent up a person fairly soon and it turned out that someone on the staff had turned off the hot water valve before we arrived. Turning on the valve cured the problem but no one in management ever apologized for this considerable inconvenience; this is not up to par for a high-end hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Loved this hotel Le Royale Meridien became my favorite hotel chain after my stay in their new Shanghai location. When I first walked into the hotel I knew it was going to be a great stay, the staff literally nabbed my bags the minute I got through the revolving door. From a quick glance, I think there were about 5 staff to each guest. There was not line-up at the check-in and the staff were very helpful. When I got to the room I was very happy to see that it was fairly large and the renovations were modern and very new. The shower was interesting as there were glass walls and you could see out when showering (could actually watch TV while showering!). The bed was very comfortable and there was a huge 40&quot; plasma (or LCD) TV hung on the wall. I think the internet was free and the working area was decent. I was on a very high floor and had a very nice view. The breakfast buffet was also very good, a great selection of East &amp; West cuisine. We were also very close to the the Bund and had a main shopping strip just near us. I was very happy with my stay and would definitely return if I travel to Shanghai again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Excellent views I chose this hotel primarily because of the excellent views from floor to ceiling windows. The room was fine. We looked at a junior suite but felt it didn't look much different than the room. We chose to stay on an Executive floor (57th) with the perks of free breakfast and evening cocktails. Service was excellent throughout the hotel. The hotel is right in front of the Nanjing pedestrian road and across from People's Square. I usually stay at the JW Marriott which is across the square. The Marriott has better bathrooms but the Meridien has much better views and a better location. Right outside the hotel is the pedestrian area where you can buy water or whatever you need. The JW Marriott doesn't have anything right outside it like that. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"A superb hotel with superb service Other than the bizarre onslaught of fake bag hawkers assaulting you on walking out the rear entrance to Nanjing Lu, this hotel is well located, beautifully furnished, welcoming, and flawless. It may be one of the best Starwood hotels in the world. That's high praise; I've stayed at a lot of their best properties worldwide. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Love This Hotel I loved everything about this hotel, It is the most modern hotel I've ever stayed in, and was extemely warmly decorated. The views from the rooms are amazing. There is a huge indoor pool, with a sun-bathing deck overlooking the city. The staff was friendly, helpful and courteous. I could not have asked for more. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Loved Le Royal Meridien Shanghai! Just returned from a short trip to Shanghai where my husband and I stayed at Le Royal Meridien (LRM) for 3 nights. We absolutely loved the ambience of the hotel and the modern, clean rooms. Having stayed on the 30th-ish floor, we had a spectacular view of the city, and the floor to ceiling windows absolutely did the view justice.Loved the efficiency of housekeeping and keeping us supplied at all times with bottled water was greatly, greatly appreciated. All amenities were re-stocked on a daily basis, shower was awesome, and evening turn-down service was great (more water, towels, etc.).The hotel is also in the best possible location, right on Nanjing Road. I say skip the pricey hotel breakfast and instead head right over to the cute cafes across the street for a fabulous, filling morning meal. We ate at Jamaica Blue every morning; their bacon &amp; egg sandwiches on ciabatta bread were delish!Probably my only complaint, as others have noted, is the confusing elevator system. It's cumbersome having to take 2 of them just to get to the ground floor. Here's a tip though: from the ground floor, take the &quot;hidden&quot; set of elevators, located BEHIND the more obvious set of elevators (the more obvious set has a podium and staff standing there to greet you). This way, when you get to the lobby level, you come face-to-face with the next set of elevators, instead of having to walk around an entire wall. Also, in this day and age, hotels should start offering complimentary internet access, especially with so many business people traveling throughout China. Hopefully, LRM can get on that soon. I really have nothing but high marks for overall quality, service and hospitality. Check-in was a breeze as well as check-out. Out of 508 hotels, LRM rightfully owns a top spot in the rankings. In general, I have been very pleased with the Starwood properties in Shanghai. The Westin is also wonderful but in a less-convenient area. I can't wait to try the St. Regis when I'm back there next month. So far, though LRM is my absolute favorite (and that includes the Four Seasons)! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel We just returned from China and our final stop was 3 days in Shanghai at the Le Meridien. We loved this hotel. Great localtion-lots of shops,c cafes, coffee shops and shopping galore close by. Our room was beautful and well maintained. The breakfast buffet was great! We would recommend this hotel -it was a five star experience.Also for those with disabilties the hotel privides a free wheelchair. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Awesome experience! Just returned from a week at this wonderful hotel. The location couldn't be better, the doormen were incredibly helpful and the entire hotel was modern, gorgeous and spotless. We booked and highly recommend the Royal Club Floor. The service was superb and the Club Room is perfect and serene, with spectacular views. The breakfast and evening cocktails are outstanding. Can't wait to return! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Hotel is ok but nothing for single females Read all the good comments here, so decided to stay in the Le Meridien during my trip to Shanghai this month. Had an interesting experience there what its worth to share:At my arrival I really was getting lost with the confusing elevator system there, the staff in the lobby recognized me, but ignored me. Finally I found the reception and get an quick check in. When I arrived in my room I recognized that there was a strange smell in the bathroom. I called the operator to fix it, and somebody showed up with a spray after 10 minutes. In the meantime I saw there were many black hairs on my bed and in the bathroom, so I decided to move in another room. I tried to explain that the boy with the spray, but no English in all, so I called the operator again. She told me, I have to come down to the reception. Ok, I just had a 15 hours flight behind me, I only wanted a shower and a clean room, but I was too tired to discuss. So I went down, luckily I found the agent who checked me in, she was really smart, she gave me another room in a higher floor and she apologized for the inconvenience.At the moment I wanted to leave the reception a person asked me from behind, if there was any problem, I turned around and a small man was smiling to me. He introduced himself as the General Manager of this hotel and he asked me to wait. He approached the reception and asked the lady to change my room again. I was a little surprised about that, but to confuse to say anything.The General Manager gave my the new room key and told me, that I can use the Club Lounge free of charge during my stay, and he hope to see me there for breakfast in the next days. He gave me his name card with the words that I may call him anytime if there is anything he can do for me.I went back to my new room (very huge, they called it &quot;Executive Suite&quot;) and was surprised again, that after 10 minutes an associate brought me a fruit basket and a bottle of red wine and card signed by the General Manager. I felt a little bit strange about this man at this moment, but too tired to think about it.I had some business meetings the other days and don’t get the breakfast in the Club, one time I tried the “Happy Hour” there in the evening, but the staff was not very attentive, the tables in the lounge were full of empty glasses and plates, you have to get your drinks by yourself, a lot of staff standing around, but no one of them offered assistance and help. They were chatting with each other on the desk the whole time.But to come to the end of my story, I was come back late one night, and I saw the General Manager in my guest floor hand in hand with a Chinese lady (he did not saw me), going to a guest room just two rooms next to my room. This confuses me, but I thought maybe it’s his wife, I heard, that in some hotels the General Manager stay there. But two days later, I saw him again, with another lady (much taller), going in the same room, this time he recognized me, and he smiled to me.Next morning I choose the Club for breakfast and had a chat with a staff member, and yes, the girl confirmed, the General Manager of the Meridien life’s in the hotel, and yes, he has his room on my floor and he is not married!The whole story confused me, specially the room change to his floor on my arrival day and how he approached me on that day, so I decided to move out on the next day and stay in the Westin, 15 minutes far from the Meridien. So far, the Meridien hotel is ok, except the Club Lounge, this is nothing special in my eyes, but if you are travelling as a single female, better select another hotel when you are in Shanghai, after the things I saw and I expressed, I would not feel comfortable there anymore. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic hotel We recently stayed at Le Meridien as part of an extended tour of China booked with a tour operator.This hotel is currently the tallest in Shanghai and is well situated. Our room was on the 24th floor with good views over the city. The best views however were from the bar on 66th - spectacular at night. We were very happy with everything in our room.The food was excellent. You would have to be very hard to please not find suitable food at the buffet breakfast - the choice was the widest we had during our entire trip. We also had afternoon tea in the Cafe and ate in the Italian restaurant on one evening. Again, food and service were outstanding. The young Italian male waiter was charming.The swimming pool and associated area had good views over the city and the facilities were again excellent.The staff are the greatest asset at this hotel. They are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and went out of their way to assist. Their English was generally good.Would highly recommend this hotel - our group loved it. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Wow what a view! Wonderful stay all around, from the room to the facilities. We stayed for two nights in Le Royal Meridien Shanghai and loved our room, which had an amazing view of downtown Shanghai extending to the Bund and across the water to Pudong, including the famed Pearl of the Orient and Jinmao tower. The beauty of the hotel is that all the rooms are above the 20th floor, and every room has floor to window ceilings, so you're guarenteed a great view. On top of that, room amenities are truly five star, by American and European standards. I've stayed a lot of &quot;five star&quot; Chinese hotels, but this is the real thing--modern bathroom fixtures with ceiling rain shower and large comfortable tub clean enough to take a bath in. Separate toilet and sink areas. 42inch Samsung plasma TV, and just a load of other details that make the stay a pleasure (free shoe shine, Le Occitane shower products, etc ,etc). The pool is indoors with a great gym and outdoor sunbathing balcony. Posh but reasonably priced restaurants for a five star hotel--try the dim sum at the Cantonese restaurant--as good as Hong Kong. The room is work every cent--we paid more than for any hotel we've paid for in China, but it was well worth it. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Le Royal Experience My wife and I stayed at the Le Royal Meridien during our three day stay in Shanghai. We absolutely loved the hotel and could not find anyting to complain about at all (which is surprising considering that we are pretty picky about the hotels we stay at). The location was perfect!! Right in the middle of Nanjing Rd across from People's square. It was across the street from the metro and a 10-15 min walk to the Bund. There are cafe's, restaurants, coffee shops and gelato stands right outside the door which is very convenient. There are many other luxury hotels in Shanghai, but their locations were not as exciting and they are more expensive. The hotel decor was amazing! Beautiful lobby and fresh flowers everywhere. Very modern, yet comfortable and warm. Our room was spacious with a great view of Nanjing Rd. We loved the rain shower and the plasma TV! The service was perfect as well. There were nice, smiling people everywhere just waiting to help you with anything. All of the hotel staff spoke English (which was not our experience at other hotels in China) and gave us great recommendations on shopping and restaurants.I would highly recommend this hotel because of it's perfect location, great service and modern and cozy rooms. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"hotel comments My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in March, 2008 and I selected it because of its proximity to Tanjin Road which is a pedestrian mall running right down to the Bund (which is famous for its pre-World War 2 architecture) and is right on the river. Our impression of Shanghai is a bustling modern city of 18 million. The hotel is approx. 65 stories high and we chose the Club floor. The buffet breakfast was quite nice but the cocktail evening food was a little short on quantity but after we complained to one of the senior staff things improved dramatically.The room we had on the 40th level was OK but the rainshower was unusual in that the water covered the entire bathroom floor before draining away. At least you had plenty of space. There is a separate bath and vanity. The toiletries are 1st class. Go the the top floor at any time and get the magnificent view. Make sure you have a room on at least the 40th floor (the Club is on the 44th floor) as the different lifts below that level can be a problem. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. All in all a good hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Disappointing for a five star This hotel did not meet expectations. The service is outstanding. However, the rooms were undone and not well kept. You can see the mold in the bathroom tiles and food is okay. I would say this hotel is all show in the architecture but with little substance in conveying that it's a five star hotel. This hotel lacks attention to detail. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"no doubt the best place to stay Ultra modern hotel in the absolute best location in Shanghai.Close to Nanjing pedestrain mall,the Bund,great shopping,People's park with its Museums and old Shanghai.Short and cheap cab rides take you to many great eating districts including Xintiandi and the French Concession area.Solicitors(watches,bags,massages) minor nuissance outside hotel.All major hotels seem to have this small problem.If you ignore them they will leave you alone.The city is very safe.We walked everywhere and took the subway-easy to use and very modern.We had a club room at first which was very nice on th e44th floor then we upgraded to the Imperial Suite.The views from the 60th floor suite we amazing esp from the bathtub.We will never forget it.The service in the club lounge was incredible.We felt the staff went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.Thanks to Ken ,Bobo and the rest of the concierge staff for making our stay unforgettable and for their fantastic advice on restaurants.The location cant be beat.If you like modern high rises in central location than look no further.For a more contemporary look then the Four Seasons is a good option but you wont get the views. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Overwhelmed I have stayed in countless hotels all over the world for business and pleasure but this one has been the best experience ever.We stayed on the 39th floor in a Grand Delux Suite with an appointed butler who went out of his way to cater for our needs from measuring up my trousers for shortening to going out of the hotel to look for my particular brand of shaving head. Though most of the hotel staff are young in their mid twenties, their zest to assist in every way has made this hotel special. We stayed for 4 nights in a suite that can only be described as heavenly from the burgandy teak wooden floor in the sitting area to the stunning bathroom which can only be rivalled by the Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles France, I was really impressed by the attention to detail in the room where everything was neatly placed even the shower head was turned towards the wall so as to avoid being sprayed with cold water when you put it on! The view was truely panoramic extending more than 180 degrees. Facilities were superb though we only tried the Chinese restaurant which had excellent food and a great selection of wines and champagne. You can book a private room there for dinner with a full view of the main skyline. The hotel is beautifully presented in contemporary style with high class fittings and enjoy the facilities and view at the Royal Club Lounge and Bar on the 44th and 65th floors respectively. There's 24 hour room service and please try the wanton soup and noodle soup ( Taiwan style). The only problem can initially be the lifts but there's sufficient staff to direct you appropriately. I will definitely be returning to this hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Nice Hotel Great Location Upgrade to Royal Club My parents and I (Parents 66, I am 35) just returned from 5 nights at Le Royal Meridien Shanghai. We chose the hotel based on the reviews, location and royal club level amenities.We took the MAGLEV bullet train (40-50 RMB/person ($6-7) ) from the airport for the 7 minute ride into Shanghai Pudong area. From there we took a ~40-52 RMB ($6-7) cab to the hotel. You could instead choose to walk across the street to the Metro station for a ~$1 fare for a six stop metro to peoples square station which is right next to the hotel. Its quite busy at the peoples square station and you will have plenty of opportunities to experience that insanity later in your trip so I would suggest just taking the cab from the MAGLEV. MAKE SURE you have the hotel address and location printed in CHINESE before you go. You can find this and print it from the Meridien website.As others have recommended, we second the idea of upgrading to the Royal Club level. With access to the lounge, we ate breakfast, had daily cocktails, ate dinner and used the free internet to stay connected to our lives back home (although its very slow...56K when I checked the bandwidth). The food is buffet style but we found they had a nice selection of appetizer portions that could easily be substituted for a meal. We chose to eat at the hotel due to the high number of poor reviews of Shangahi restaurants. We did have a few meals out in the city but used the Royal Club more often than not in order to eat breakfast and dinner.The rooms are modern, there are a number of english news and movie channels, we had amazing views of the city and the staff was very attentive. The staff booked tickets to see the acrobats for my parents, they called my cab driver and had my gloves returned to me after I left them accidently and they were eager to provide help whenever we wanted.Le Royal Meridien has a great location on Nanjing road so you can easily get to several areas of the city by foot, metro or cab ride (very cheap).Overall, we really enjoyed our stay in the hotel and our only gripe would be the painfully slow free internet in the Royal Club lounge as well as the upcharge if you used the internet in your room (also slow). "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Quite nice The service here is excellent, as is the breakfast and buffet dinner. However, I didn't like being charged to use the internet in the bedroom (which didn't even work properly) and I also got a little confused with all of the different lifts. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Dirty Dirty Cleaning Practices!!!! This was my 2nd time staying there...overall we have stayed here for 10 days. The room is very nice, but the problem is that they have hired people off the street to clean the rooms. These people have no experience it seems like, and have LOW STANDARDS of cleanliness!! This would be a health code violation in America!! The first day, I had the cleaning lady come into our room, and clean while I was there. She came from the next room over with a small handcarry cleaning caddy. I wondered where her big cleaning cart was. It didn't exist.She first RINSED out our used glass with water, and then proceeded to dry it out with a DIRTY RAG, that she had in her caddy. She then used this rag to wipe the mirror. Then she went , and wiped the counters, and then went inside the bathroom. I am standing right there, watching her, and she is cleaning as if this is normal. She proceeds to wipe the TOILET, TOILET SEAT, where my toddler son had peed over the night before, and then starts wiping the toilet floor, and now is proceeding to wipe the entire marble floor with this cloth. She did not rinse/ exchange this cloth not even once. I finally had to tell her to stop cleaning, and after that, I did not let them clean our room. A few other staff who helped exchange our towels out, and garbage cans, had the same nasty cleaning knowledge. When garbage dumped out on the floor, they wiped up the garbage can, and continued to wipe the floor...with a dirty rag. Staff here are not used to clean ways. I really now question the cleanliness of the restaurants. I trust the Italian restaurant a little more, since they have a foreign renowned? chef working there, but as for the Chinese restaurant....I don't know. Le Meridien is part of the SPG Starwood Hotels Preferred Group, and they are aware of this problem, but have not fixed it at all of their hotels. I just watched a Fox news clip on the hidden cameras they installed. The hotel stay was okay, other than this problem. I do like the room set up, and decor. The only other problem was hotel transportation. We paid premium bucks for the hotel/airport pickup service, and the drivers drove like maniacs. Feel free to warn them that they need to drive slow and complain to management! This is a serious issue! I made sure they knew I wanted them to drive slow, and we still came 1 inch away from an accident, driver slammed on his brakes. He was tailgating, speeding, weaving in and out of 80% of other cars, and the traffic was very light. This is after I made sure the bellhop tell him to drive slowly, because of our first nightmare experience, where the fellow drove like a maniac at 1 am in the morning (flight was delayed) during thick fog. We are certainly not in any hurry to get to the hotel, and traffic was non existent.Last thing about the hotel....it has 4 or 5 restaurants to eat at...so there are a lot of choices for dining. I do not trust all the food, but there was nothing else better that I knew of, so we ate there. If you can get Executive Lounge access, you are in good hands. You get free internet, free drinks (San Pellegrino), free alcohol drinks during happy hours, snacks, and free buffet breakfast. We ate breakfast at both buffets (the free one, and the expensive one downstairs). Of course, the expensive one is better, but if you have lounge access, I would just stick to the free buffet, since they have a lot of the same items from downstairs. Also, you can request/ order eggs at the lounge, though they do not tell you this.Would I stay here again? Maybe. Because I do not know where else to trust in China. Will any other 5 star hotel clean better? I don't think so. Is there any way to complain and make the hotel better? I don't think so. The standards in China are lower, overall. That's my personal opinion. I have complained about both topics, but we'll see if there is any change. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Varied Level of Service The best part is its location. Then the service (not the front desk, not the room cleaning staff) are the most prompt and wonderful that I've ever experienced.The layout of the room is strange, so you basically go through the bathroom to go to the bedroom. My brother calls it a way to save money (same amount of money for less sqft). Well, he is a diehard Marriott fan and their family decided to stay at JW Marriott this time.I travelled by myself and booked a &quot;Grand Deluxe - Higher Floor&quot; room. Apparently I was not given a higher floor room after talking to my husband, who stayed there couple times before. It took my husband calling from US to get my room changed, because either I am not firm enough or I looked too cheap.The room cleaning staff kept re-arranging my personal toiletries I put on the glass shelves. Those were not on the sink counter where they clean every day. And one day they did not clean the room until around 5pm though I put the sign for room makeup early in the morning.If not for the location, I may very well stay at St. Regis next time, which is about the same price.

le royal meridien shanghai ,"Beautifully decorated but very uncomfortable room I stayed 2 nights in ealry Jan 2008. I chose it because of the location, and the convenience of using my SPG points. The hotel and room is beautifully decorated, but I was not able to sleep well there. Such experience never happened to me. I was very disappointed.I was not able to sleep the whole night first night, I was heavily suffering from allergy - I believe the room has lots of mold around sink and bath room area. As i was carrying a light cold, I intially was confused by the symptoms until the next day morning, I went out, it's all cleared, I went back inside and as sson as i got closer to the sink and bathroom, i started to sneeze, and have red itchy eyes full of tears. I had to request another room, The minute I stepped in the other room, I found myself feel much better. I had to conclude it's indeed the problem of the first room. The bellboy told me such thing happened to some other guests, primarily because of the poorly maintained facility in the room.n others. The buffet is very expensive - 450rmb a head. However, temperature in both room is very hot unless you set the air con temperature to 18C and kept setting to high. The 2nd room was cool when I was led in by the bell boy, however after I turned off the aircon, it became very hot. I had to keep the air con on 18c and high for the whole night. There are many lights in the hallway and inside the room thus easily generate lots of heat. The staff was friendly but didn't do anything(except verbal appology) to comfort me when I complained my experience at the check-out. I didn't use other hotel facility, so can't comment oStay away from this hotel, not to be fooled by the look and location. There are other good hotels just a few steps away. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Western-standard luxury in the East We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our holiday and it spoiled our expectations for the rest of the holiday! Our standard room was luxurious, with a view of People's Park and lovely rain shower and tub. The L'Occitane toiletries were a nice touch, as was the DVD player in the room - a great way to escape from the crowds of Nanjing Road on a rainy afternoon.The cleanliness of the room and hotel surroundings is on par with any Western luxury hotel. I say this because other hotels in China, while advertising themselves to be 3 or 4 star properties, do not measure up to the level of service and cleanliness. We ate at the Chinese restaurant at the hotel (Ai Mei?) and found it to be one of the best we sampled in Shanghai and outside the city over a 12 day period. Overall, the service was fantastic - from the smooth check-in, the room service at 4am, storage of our bags for a few days as we travelled outside of Shanghai and to the manager's response to a complaint we had for the slow service at the Chinese restaurant. They did a fantastic job rectifying our complaint.PRO / TOP TIP: It can be difficult communicating with taxi drivers in Shanghai so make sure you ask for one of the folding maps from the concierge at the Meridien (looked like it was made specially for the hotel) - this was the BEST TOOL we had during our entire stay as it has both the English and Chinese names of top attractions, as well as no-nonsense pictures of the attractions and metro stops. We had various other maps throughout our stay but the one at the Meridien got us to some of the markets we had trouble finding because we couldn't communicate with the taxi drivers. CON: The only thing we were not too thrilled about was the hoardes of people at People's Park / Nanjing Road - this caused us to move to the French Concession at the end of our holiday, but otherwise the Meridien would have been an excellent choice! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Perfection at Le Royal Meridien Shanghai Stayed at the Le Meridien Shanghai with family during Christmas and found the hotel impeccable! Room was spacious, clean, and had a moderndesign with Shanghai skyline views. Great plasma flat-screen T.V! Many hotel staff were extremely helpful, even there to press elevator buttons and to greet us. The Hotel is perfectly located on Nanjing Road about a 10 minute walk from the Bund. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with a spectacular variety of Chinese and Western food. TheHotel is connected to a rather high-end mall with a convenient grocerystore. Overall, The Le Royal Meridien is the hotel to stay at for business and leisure and cannot be beat. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Stay here - chic ultramodern stylish This is a new, modern and stylish hotel with a perfect service. The staff spoke english very well, was friendly and helpful with tips for restaurant, sightseeing etc..We booked a room with access to the royal club lounge. The room was 38m2 and with a panoramic view and floor to ceiling windows. Great! The room was modern and stylish and non smoking what we appreciated (in China a lot of rooms smell heavily from former smoking guests).The non plus ultra was the royal club lounge. A cozy retreat for a quiet breakfast or lounging during day and evening. The breakfast selection was good with a buffet and eggs to order. What we absolutely loved was the cocktail time. A huge buffet with cheese selection, chinese food, antipasti and a good selection of wine (included). The buffet was refilled until late evening. The upgrade for a the royal club floor is absolutely worth the money for the food, the calm and the great views. There are several internet accesses (for free) in the club lounge.The hotel bar on the top floor is also worth a visit. Large windows, cozy loungers and a fireplace.The location of the hotel is very convenient. Just at the beginning of the shopping street. You can also walk to the bund, but we prefered the taxi (very cheap).The pool has large windows overlooking town and an open terrasse. Very nice designed, clean and a good place for relaxing after sigtseeing. There is a fancy juice bar close to the pool.At the spa, I had one of my best foot massage. The spa ist very expensive, but also here, modern design and stylish.We never had dinner at the hotel because there were so many fancy restaurants outside to try. We had dinner at Va bene, an upscale italian restaurant at the new hot spot Xintiandi. The food was really italian and very good, nice italian wine selection though expensive.The other night we ate new heights (three on the bund) which has a fantastic open terrasse with full view over the bund. The food is simple yet tasty (Pasta, burger...). It is an in-place, but with a relaxed atmosphere. We liked it much better than m on the bund next door. Every week, a new stylish restaurant is opend in Shanghai. Skip the hotel restaurant and try one of the new restaurants. Xintiandi is a place, packed with stylish restaurants with flavours from all over the world (japanese, italian, french, ...). and upscale shops like shanghai tang. The hotel concierge is very helpful with restaurants tips and reservations.Stay at Royal meridien and upgrade for the royal club lounge, you will not regret! If you search for a chinese atmosphere, than it is not the right place for you . "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great location This is a wondeful hotel in the middle of Shanghai. It's just off Nanjing Road and within walking distance of the busy shopping district, and even the Bund is a mere 15 minutes away on foot.Hotel is very new so the room decor is modern and nice. Layout is a little atypical which I appreciated. The bathroom area is pretty nice.Allure, the French restaurant, serves excellent food. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Impeccable Accomodations I selected this hotel partially based on others' reviews here, and I was not at all disappointed! I stayed for 3 nights in a room on the 55th floor. This gorgeous and functional room had a beautiful view of People's Park, a beautiful area with a huge fountain, gardens, etc. right outside of the Shanghai Museum. I also had an amazing panoramic view of the city from the South to the West. The plate of fruit and free drink upon my arrival in the room was a very nice touch as well.The Royal Club lounge on the 44th floor (you have free access to the Club if you are staying on a Royal Club floor) had not only wonderful hors d'oeuvres each evening, but also had a great buffet breakfast in the morning. The Club also had several computers for accessing the Internet for free.The neighborhood around the hotel has a bakery, several restaurants, two Starbucks, a shopping mall and the major shopping street in Shanghai - Nanjing Road. Also, the Shanghai Museum is within walking distance (and is a wonderful museum).I highly recommend this hotel - the service was impeccable, the staff was friendly, the room was extremely comfortable - it was worth the price. (My only complaint was the Internet access - it was expensive and extremely slow.) "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Enjoyed my stay Stayed for 2 nights. Room very comfortable, bed great, bathrm was wonderful- only few minor improvements could be made. gym &amp; pool of average size but more then adequate for a good workout. Could not really fault the restaurants, except that they did not reconize my Asia miles card for earning miles, they should as it is advertised on Cx Asia miles site. breakfast was one of best I have had in a hotel coffee shop. Although it was very busy the staff were constantly cleaning tables &amp; food was replenished quickly. hotel rms very quiet as the hotel only starts from a very high floor- below I believe are offices. Even the massage I got at the Spa was excellent- of course expensive by Chinese standards. my stay way GREAT! Oh &amp; do go by the Chinese Rest. to see this AMAZING Aquarium they have!! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Wonderful --- we will return We spent 3 nights at this very nice hotel. We opted for the Club Floor which was a wise choice as you get an upper floor room, access to free internet, free breakfast, and cocktails and snacks from 1730-2000. One night we just took snacks for our supper --- the snacks were excellent and substantial. The service was very good especially their very willing attitude. They may not have gotten every request right on the first try because of minor language barriers but they were so willing to correct anything. They also were superb at filling special requests related to shopping, meal reservations, and the like. We went to Shanghai not knowing what to expect but enjoyed it so much that we are planning a return trip --- this time for at least 2 weeks so that we can &quot;walk the city&quot;.We booked in advance on the internet which drove the rate down to what we felt was reasonable for the room and service. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Absolutely perfect! This is a fantastic hotel without a doubt! From the moment you pull up in front of the entrance till you check-out. Stayed in the Royal Club Lounge and do yourself a huge favor and upgrade to that if you have just booked an &quot;ordinary room&quot;. You get an exclusive check-in on the 44th floor, rooms from the 53rd floor or something like that and then up - it is one of the best views in Shanghai. When checking in your are offered a drink and that by the way just continues into an open bar (perhaps) 24hr a day (soft drinks). From 5pm to 8pm they have free snacks (could replace an entire meal), a free bar with good whiskey, champagne, vodka, martinis and so on. A great way to warm up for the perfect Shanghai night. The Spa is top class, with a warmed up pool and unisex spa (not like the Radisson in Shanghai which have a nice but cold pool). Men have a jacuzzi as well in their changing room. The nightclub is a bit more boring than the one at the Radisson, but it'll more than do the trick as you couldn't ask for much more, when sitting on the 65th floor overlooking the Shanghai skyline. The service is excellent and the rooms a among the best I've seen. Nice interior, nice bathroom with everything you need and a DVD player, even though I can't imagine spending much time there watching the 42&quot; flat screen TV - Shanghai calls, and the Meridien is a perfect base for your explorations. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"More style then substance Although this is a very glam hotel (President Sarkozy was resident during my visit) the service still needs some work. Definitely not five star (yet). My check-in was particularly disappointing. Even though I paid extra for a 'grand' deluxe room (in order to stay on a high floor), I was given a room on the 31st floor (which is only 1 floor up from the deluxe room floors). If I was only there for a few nights it wouldn't be an issue. But I was booked for 8 nights. I asked if there was anything higher up. The front desk staff didn't even bother to check - just said no. He handed me the key and turned away, leaving me to struggle with the baffling elevator system that previous reviewers have had issues with. I late found out that my colleage who was booked in a regular deluxe room was staying on the 37th floor. Go figure! As in other Chinese hotels I have stayed in, the female staff tend to be much more helpful and service-oriented. Must be the 'little emperor' system.As with another reviewer's complaints (Flannelpyjamas)- air conditioning was an issue. Even though I had it turned down on the lowest setting, the room was extremely warm at night. Other guests had the same complaint as I heard the standard reply over and over (&quot;we are now on the winter system&quot;) Which apparently means air con has been completely shut off. I also could smell cigarette smoke through the system. Breakfast is fairly standard and nothing to get excited about. 15 minutes before breakfast finishes the staff start to clear up and have no qualms about rushing you out. Gym is very good. The bar on the top floor is stunning. Concierge helpful, and the door staff very friendly. I was fairly disappointed as the reviews had been so good. Next time I'll probably stay at the Four Seasons where the rooms may not be as hip, but the service warrants the price. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Everything right! Beautiful hotel, perfect central location, surrounded by shops and amenities, fantastic rooms with ceiling to floor windows, excellent service, great food and what a view from our 58th floor room! We paid a bit extra for a royal club room and enjoyed the benefits of the club lounge, well worth it.Would definitely stay here again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. We were in a Grand Delux room which was very nice. Big Plasma, sofa, desk looking out the floor to celling windows.We booked a &quot;Royal Club&quot; room which was the &quot;executive floor&quot; with access to the executive lounge. This gave us complementary buffet breakfast, afternoon tea from 2.30-5.00 and &quot;evening cocktails&quot; from 5.30-8.00 which was fingerfood type buffet and complimentary drinks (but ironically no cocktails!). The drinks were all good quality and you can just help yourself to spirits, wine, beer and soft drinks.Other than that it had all the things you would expect from a 5* hotel - impressive pool, decour, staff, etc.So great hotel, good location but what 'made' it for us was the Royal Club stuff. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent hotel We stayed for three nights 11/8-11/11. Hotel great location, can walk many places. Concierge great, you contact by email before hand and setup tours, restaraunts etc...(ask for Mike or Max).Hotel elevators very confusing and painful if you want to go to the gym or spa and have to cross the lobby in &quot;gym clothing&quot;. Lounge floor breakfast, evening snack, afternoon drinks etc.. great, large room, wonderful view, quality food. Hotel room a bit small for a Five Star hotel, but great bathroom/shower/tub. Nice flat screen TV and reasonable bed. All in all, a wonderful hotel would stay there again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Resist the Club Level; Ask for a River View We stayed here before (see my review of May 11, 2007), and liked the location so much that we returned despite a few quibbles with the hotel. And we'd probably come back again.The standard rooms - which some wag at Starwood corporate labeled &quot;Grand Deluxe&quot; - are good sized but not huge for a hotel of this class. There is only one sink without much counter space. The toilet enclosure is a frosted glass partition which lets all sound through. The combined shower and tub area is well-designed, and includes an electric curtain that can be raised to give you a view of the skyline (and vice versa).The rest of the room is comfy enough, with a useful sitting area and floor to ceiling windows. The river view rooms (sometimes called Bund view) provide a lovely panorama of buildings, river, and people walking on Nanjing Road. We took the oversized two of the four pillows on the bed, and made a comfy window seat for reading and drinking in the view.So if you get a standard &quot;Grand Deluxe&quot; room with a view of People's Park, it's worth asking for an upgrade to river view or a larger room.On check-in, we got the hard sell of a 400 yuan upgrade to the club level, with free breakfast. Don't do it. The standard club rooms are not any better - in fact, because they don't face the river, they are worse. The real perk here is free use of the internet terminals - but only because of the extortionate 5 yuan per minute charged in the Business Center. Pay for breakfast and check your email when you get home.The lobby breakfast buffet, despite decent variety, lacks quality and interest on both the Asian &amp; Western offerings. (And the club level breakfast is a scant offering - use your freebie at the lobby instead.) For variety, buy some fresh baked breads and coffee at the bread shop next to the back entrance on the ground floor, if you can wait until they open at 8:30. For a tenth the price of the buffet, you can eat at the tables outside and watch the lady drill team excercising and the ballroom dancers just across Nanjing Road.The location is great, on Nanjing Road near the Metro. But as others have mentioned, walking on Nanjing Road means being constantly bombarded by hucksters trying to sell watches and shoes, and, if you're a lone male, massages. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Beautiful stylish rooms at the Meridien We spent three nights at the Royal Meridien during our 10 day visit to China. Our superior room with king size bed was gorgeous. Very comfortable bed, nice bathroom with rain shower, huge flat panel LCD television. Nice colors and lighting. Remainder of the hotel is just as beautiful.We enjoyed the fitness center, and had a great meal at the hotel's French restaurant, and at the Italian restaurant. Breakfast buffet was adequate, service somewhat erratic at breakfast. Otherwise, service was excellent throughout our stay. Complicated elevators take a bit of getting used to, but the staff are always available to assist. Overall, we had a delightful stay, and would recommend this hotel to other travels desiring a comfortable oasis in a busy city. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and chose this hotel. We were not disappointed. The hotel has a great location at the end of Nanjing Road. We easily walked to the Bund and the Shanghai Museum, but were accosted by hawkers selling fake goods and prostitutes every few feet. It became tiresome very quickly, but that is typical of Shanghai. The rooms were great with spectacular views. The staff was friendly and more than willing to help. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Mixed in the Middle of Shanghai I have mixed feelings about this hotel. From the surface it seemed ultra chic and modern. But with a closer look, you’ll find that the modern glass décor troubling, elevator system confusing, air conditioning erratic, and one of the worst hotel spas in the world. All these features packaged into $310+ US a night. I chose to stay at this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was rated the number one hotel to stay in Shanghai. I will confirm that the location is in the heart of everything, but getting to and from the hotel is not so convenient, even if you’re using public transportation. My local colleague was stuck in the subway for two hours trying to get back to the hotel. The human traffic along the Nanjing Road makes it difficult even for taxis to maneuver. A five minute ride could be 30 minutes during peak weekday hours. This is something to consider if you are here for business, and need to get to several locations efficiently. Do prepare to throw your schedule out the window. On the other hand being able to walk around to all the shops and restaurants outside of your hotel is extremely convenient. But this location won’t be the only place you’ll spend your time if you’re sightseeing. The hustle and bustle of this shopping Mecca starts to wear you down after a while.As for the room, it was bright, clean, modern, and very very cold. When I mean cold, I am implying two things: the air conditioning system and the décor. The air blasts even when set at low and I had to wear a jacket with temperatures set at 23. Anything higher, the room became muggy and humid. When I turned off the air conditioning, I could smell cigarette smoke coming through the system from other rooms. Flowing air kept smoke out of the room. It was very strange.The toilet is separated from the rest of the room with a heavy frosted glass door. Even with the frosted glass doors, the toilet isn’t very private. I hated the toilet arrangement. In fact, walking into the room initially was like walking into a bathroom The sink is exposed in the room, and makes it feel really out of character. If you’re sharing the room with someone other than your family, there will be privacy issues and a noise factor. The bath area is a fish bowl. The shower is separated from the tub area, which is nice, but you’re basically showering inside the bathroom floor. This is common practice in Asia, and personally, I think it’s efficient for cleaning and I didn’t find it a problem. Not everyone will appreciate it, and the area given to shower is a little small and the walls are glass. (You have to lower the exterior shade if you want a private shower, otherwise you will be on display.) Basically, this means if you shower, the water will spray throughout the whole bath area…including inside the tub. Don’t hang any clothes in the bath area unless you’re prepared to get the items wet. The shower didn’t have hot water for me after my second night in the hotel. I had to switch to using the hand shower attached to the tub. Not a bad situation, but if I were tall, it would be have been very inconvenient. Bath water was yellow. (Could be a plumbing issue with the city, and not the hotel's fault.)The bath amenities were very nice. I hadt toothbrushes, sewing kit, bottles of drinking water, and L’Occitane bath supplies were an added bonus. The water kettle and the French press came with complimentary tea and ground coffee. This was actually nice to see rather than the usual instant coffee packets (also available, but at least I had a choice). The wide flat screen TV was a plus with plenty of movie stations, and the bed linens were clean and comfortable. The fresh orchids next to the lounge chair were a nice touch, and my room included a sofa and coffee table. This gave me more room to spread out and relax. I had a nice view from my 37th floor bay window. The lighting was also done well. I had low and bright light options. There was internet access with no wireless. This meant I was chained to the desk while working. So those nice lounge chairs didn’t get utilized as much as I would have liked. The cost for internet is $22US+ a day. The concierge service was good. But I think all concierge services in Shanghai are helpful because they get benefits when referring tours, etc… They had tour services available to guests. I didn’t do much sightseeing since my schedule was really tight. I did visit the cloth market and picked up beautiful quality silk for the fraction of what I would pay in the US. Dim Sum in the hotel’s Cantonese restaurant was nice, and free of service charge. The Sunday buffet in the lobby restaurant was very expensive, $40US+ per person. The food was mediocre…and not up to the standards of this hotel name. Go across the street to Costa Coffee for snacks and breakfast. It’s a London chain coffee house that’s pretty good. Also next door is a pretty reasonable Cantonese restaurant that’s good for quick and inexpensive meals.DO NOT go to the Le Spa inside the hotel. It was expensive, even with the special they gave me (massage and facial $180US). I began my spa experience at the check-in desk, where they handed me a cold hand towel, and a cold cup of ginger tea. I sat there sipping, while they stared at me from across the desk. Not a great introduction. I didn’t get escorted into a soothing room. I guess they scheduled my appointment really tight, so it was an “In &amp; Out” or “Drive Thru” Spa. No joking!The same girl gave me the massage and facial which was strange to me. I was suffering from muscle pain and a stiff neck. I really needed an experienced body worker. I asked her to focus on my neck and back and forget the other areas, but she didn’t know how to get off the “routine”. She didn’t work on my neck at all. While on my back, she didn’t place another pillow under my knees to protect my lower back. I had to put my knees up to keep from hurting my lower back. I remained in the position for over an hour. I asked for the hydrating facial. After a week of traveling through Asia, I needed some skin repair. The creams she used smelled awful, almost rotten. Basically, her face, and head massage techniques were terrible. After my two hour treatment, I was rushed off to the cashier to pay. I was a little dizzy from the massage, and lying on my back for so long, that I was barely able to walk. I needed a break in a room somewhere to relax. I didn’t leave a tip. I had to rush back to shower and remove the creams off my face. This hotel has not caught up to what spa services should be. It was not a spa; it didn’t even try to “fake” it. It was a complete joke. It had an inexperienced massage therapist and esthetician. I think if I wasn’t so desperate for a massage from my neck pain, I would have gotten up and walked out of the room. I kept hoping it would be better. I felt completely “had” at the end of my session. I can’t say that I would come back to this hotel anytime soon. It was really terrible value. BTW, I’m also a Starwood Gold member. I was not given an upgrade, even though I paid extra for an executive room. I didn’t get the executive floor. I suppose if they had, I might have been a little happier overall. Other reviewers who got the Club Floor gave this hotel rave reviews. If you can get a rate at $200 US per night or less, then maybe you should consider coming here. I booked directly from the SPG.com website, which is supposed to guarantee the lowest rate. Other reviewers have found rates below $200US per night elsewhere.There are many hotels to choose from in Shanghai. I tend to stay at chains that I know while traveling in Asia. I travel very frequently, mostly for work, so I’m biased to hotels with good business services, and since I don’t like to waste company money, I try to look for overall value. I felt overcharged at the end of my stay. I don’t know if I would recommend this place for a vacation. I don’t find it good value for corporate stays, so it is very doubtful I would return for a holiday visit.This was my first visit to Shanghai, and I’ll be coming back more often for work. I will probably be staying at the Shangri-la or the new Westin the next time I visit Shanghai. Lastly, Shanghai like the rest of China is probably going through growing pains. I might try this hotel again in another year or so. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Avoid the hawkers This is a fantastic 5 star hotel in a medium location. It's away from the high end hotels and Nanjing Road is right beside but the hawkers offer everything from watches to &quot;lady massages&quot;. These guys are really annoying and VERY aggresive.When you walk in, there are Zen waterfalls and lited candles at night which makes this place very inviting and relaxing but the breakffst buffet for the Royal club is poor. The service is so attentative I felt like being watched.Still the best new hotel in the city so enjoy it now before things get worn down.cj "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Good Location Le Royal Meridian was in an excellent location right next to the pedestrian section of the Nanjing Road. The room was very nice &amp; clean with the exception of the windows which were filthy. You would think with all that glass they would employ a decent window cleaner? We only had breakfast in the hotel which was average but I do wish the staff could cheer up a bit in the restaurant. The only confusing thing about the lifts were some needed your room card to make them move &amp; some didn't. I found a set of lifts that took us from the ground floor to our room floor direct. On our last night there was a noisy party on a terrace ten metres below us that went on until two o'clock in the morning. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Location Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.Very good location for shopping.Right on Nanjing Roads hustle and bustle.Had an executive room which was very clean and modern.The problem with this hotel is majority of the staff seems very stiff and unfriendly.In fact I had never written a review before but this hotel instigated my first review for praising the Westin Guangzhou.No comparison between the two.Our bad experiences were from the ground floor welcoming party and then the front desk on the lobby level.Its the first time ever I have experienced this in a hotel and yet I am a loyal Starwood Gold member.Just remembered even on check in nothing was mentioned as far as the Starwood member facilities.I'm not saying don't stay there but don't expect to much assistance when required,stay for the location and the modern facilities.Food was very good.Hotel lifts are all over the place,from Ground you have to go to Lobby then you have to walk to other lifts for your rooms and that depends on what floor your on to which lifts you take.The hotels shop on the lobby dels in gold bullions thats how inflated some items were.As I said the location for the shopping is this hotels big plus but in saying this after about the 5th time in Shanghai and on Nanjing Road prostitutes have come from everywhere.This is the biggest change I have seen in Shanghai,it was just constant approaches.I will not even discuss what was being offered.Now this is no fault of the hotel but if they dont get the authorities to put a stop to it,then this is what the patrons to this hotel face each time they walk out the front door.As a Starwood member I think I will go back to the Four Points Pudong where everything was great,or one of the other Starwood hotels.If my loyalty sways then I'm off to the Shangri-la for sure. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"An excellent experience We chose the hotel largely based on Tripadvisor recommendations; stayed 3 nights early Oct 07 and found the whole experience extremely satisfying. Booked a Royal Club room - main advantage of which is included very good buffet breakfast (+ egg dishes cooked very well to order) + free (alcoholic or non) drinks + generous snacks and finger food 5.00pm - 8.00pm in the Club Lounge - well worth the (relatively small) extra cost in my view. You can also drop into the Lounge anytime during the day for a coffee or a cool drink; also has unlimited free internet access. Found the staff throughout the hotel extremely pleasant and helpful. On arrrival, discovered we'd left a bag at airport baggage claim - I was very impressed by the quick and dedicated response of the staff to retrieve it and get it to the hotel in under 2 hours. Any other request was handled quickly and very pleasantly. Found the hotel area very good for access to, eg, Shanghai Museum (15 min walk) and The Bund (15 minute walk the other direction). Would unhesitatingly recommend the hotel; will definitely choose to stay there again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"great location and design service only good for ""foreigners"" As a 24 year old Chinese guy visiting from another country, I was ignored by staff who would only greet the non-Asians. During check-in, no one offered to take my suitcase to my room. My local friend was carrying it for me, but we felt ignored because we weren't westerners. No one showed me my room and the elevator system was quite confusing. Only the female staff helped me out, what's wrong with the male staff?The hotel itself is sleek looking and has decent views of Shanghai. The location is a tourist trap, most of the stores on Nanjing Lu are overpriced. Too many hawkers, scammers, etc. on the streets.The morning buffet was pretty good and a bargain considering it was the same price for a room service breakfast. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Wonderful to come back to at night My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, three days while touring around Shanghai. We asked for a higher up room when checking in at received floor 43 (there are a total of 60 something) which we were very happy with. We also got a great view of the TV tower. The rooms are not big by any means, but everything in the room was very efficiently arranged so you didn't feel as though you were staying in a small room at all. The bathroom was great, the rain shower was very relaxing, the temperature of the water could go very hot and the water pressure was very strong if needed. The only thing I would say about the bathroom is that it is all very open concept (i.e. the door for the room where the toilet was did not travel all the way up to the ceiling) so something for families to consider if sharing a room. I personally found the service at this hotel very good, I did not experience any of the issues that the most recent entries allude to. Then again, I don't speak Mandarin so if staff were saying things about me, I would have had no idea. The gym/sauna/steam room/pool area were great, I would definitely recommend travelers to this hotel to check it out. We ate at the buffet for lunch one day, and thoroughly enjoyed it - after lots of experimenting with local foods, it was great to have a break and get some great food that you are used to. All in all a great hotel that I would totally recommend to anyone. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great experience but not the best stayed for 5 nights early October. Lots of confusion over choice of room, i booked a Grand Deluxe and was promised an upgrade but forgot about it when checking in and was told at reception that I have already been upgraded to a Grand Deluxe, so thought it was a good deal. anyway a Grand Deluxe is only a higher floor, from 28th floor up. REalised that they say to lots if customers at reception...that you have been upgraded. 1st room was at a corner and really small, did not like it and was changed to a nomal Grand Deluxe room. after 2 nights realised that I was actually not upgraded after i checke my confirmation slip and since i was too lazy to change room and pack, asked reception if i could be offered drinks/b'fast instead of chnaging rooms. Service at reception is very poor (if you compare it to Bali, Bangkok, S'pore) but they were kind enough to offer me a junior suite which I very kindly accepted for the next 3 nights.One thing about Chinese service staff, once they think you do not understand the language, they tend to talk among themselves and since I undertsand about 70% of what was said, it was not very pleasant. Reception staff was alluding to the fact that I was a 'fussy' customerOverall a very modern hotel, stylish and rooms are extremely modern. (kinda like the new Hiltons in Bangkok and KL) rooms are small bet very good use of spaceate at Italian restaurant and the hotel Cafe, average food. used the gym once and that was very good, very modern equipment.Location is superb on Nanjing Rd and walking distance to the Bund. I got a really good rate of RMB1200 so if i can get this rate in Shanghai again, would stay here. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Modern but has some work do to with service I stayed 5 nights a the Royal Meridien and i recommend this hotel to young people that care more about style and cool bars then to people wanting excellent service. The hotel is really impressive with its bars and general atmosphere but it lacks in terms of service. For example i had to wait for a long time for my in-room breakfast (ordered it the day before) and then i tried the breakfast at the restaurant the next day but the service were slow there as well. Same thing when i checked in and asked for a non smoking room and they gave me a smoking room so i had to get down to the lobby to change room. Not big issues and chinese people are just not used to give a 5-star service yet but if you can stand these things i would recommend it. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,Excellent Hotel Probably the best hotel we stayed at in China.The rooms were excellent and had great views of the city. The breakfasts were great and for one of our nights we ate in the Italian restuarant - which was excellent.Some of family had spa treatments and we all enjoyed the gym and pool facilities. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Wonderful stay Stayed for 3 nights in Sept '07. Great service from the moment we stepped off the taxi, the luggage boys were helpful and we had a staff take us up to the reception (so we didn't have any problems at all with the lifts as some reviews mentioned).Well designed rooms, clever use of space by the designers. Not an inch was wasted and the room felt spacious and comfortable. It made me want to stay in the room and not leave!We had dinner in the French restaurant on the lobby floor. Superb food/service although expensive in Shanghai terms. Buffet breakfast was a downfall, although the menu changed slightly each day the overall selection was not good and not worth the price. Overall, excellent hotel. Will definitely come back. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Spectacular Just opened - flawless hotel. Excellent location. Wonderful attention to detail in room design. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,Wonderful experience We stayed at the Le Meridian in April 2007 and had a lovely time. I am platinum level on Starwoods so perhaps the service was above average. Other reviewers have hit the highlights of this hotel. I have been to China more than a dozen times for business and this was one of my nicest hotel experiences. Swimming by myself in the infinitity pool on the upper level as the sun came up was a treat. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"No complaints at the Le Royal Meridien Shanghai I'm a Platinum Starwood and elite member with several other programs. The Le Royal Meridien in Shanghai exceeded all my expectations and I can only look forward to a return trip. Opened in 2007, the hotel is a modern skyscraper and immaculate. Location is in the middle of Shanghai and convenient by subway or taxi to any location.My upgrade to suite on the concierge/club floor was perfect. Rooms was well layed out with a plasma (plus dvd player) is on a swivel that turns completely around for viewing from bed or couch. The bathroom was great with a tub and seperate shower - the large rain shower head and hand held were a nice relief after a hot day. The club lounge had a nice breakfast every morning (I did not notice the cook station for omelette's and more? around the corner from the cereal/fruit bar until my last day) as well as a good layout of food in the evening. Drinks were complimentary all day. The infinity pool that I had all to myself on both occasions is great and the gym is adequate. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I left an envelope of cash with the front desk for delivery from my tailor. Clothes were hanging in my room when I returned. If I had one complaint, it would be the multiple elevators needed to reach rooms but is expected in a skyscraper hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Excellent Amazing views of the city from the restaurant of the executive floor. Impressive decoration on some of the halls and rooms. Very good breakfast buffet. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Definitely a good choice Just back from staying at Le Royal Meridien Shanghai. Here are the good points:The location is very good - near shopping, restaurants and the Shanghai history museum. L'Occitane amenities - lovely verbena shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, body lotionFast room service - ordered tom yam soup, arrived in 15 minutes.Pleasant staff - polite and efficient, but did not seem genuinely concerned.Very clean - spotless rooms.Club floor - PC's with free internet access, 24 hour complimentary drinks... snacks during regular hours.Flat screen and DVD player - plus lots of cable channels to choose fromHere are the cons:Breakfast on Club Floor very ordinary. Just the usual stuff: pancakes, congee, eggs...Possible problems with water quality - after 2 days in Shanghai, I started to develop a terrible rash on my face. It could have been due to the general toxic haze of pollution that blankets the city, but if you have sensitive skin (and I don't), I suggest you rinse your face in bottled water just to be sure.So in summary, the Le Royal Meridien is definitely a good bet in Shanghai. Didn't like the city AT ALL, but would recommend the hotel to anyone going there. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic Hotel This is a great hotel. Band in downtown. The back entrance opens onto the shopping street, where you can only walk. Rooms are excellent. Try and get a high floor room. You are literally at the top of Shanghai. Service is excellent. Very good security and there are staff members everywhere to help you. Price is also not too bad. Would highly recommend staying here. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Above Average but not flawless Stayed at the meridien for 4 nights in august and I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Like most hotels in china they have enough staff to deal with the guests so check-in was quick and they always have people to direct you to the nearest elevator (no problem using them, its normal to have many elevators on hotels with 65floors like this one and I dont mind having to use the room key to go up as it is a nice safety feature). The buffet restaurant has a lovely selection of food and lovely desserts, but I thought breakfast could have more selection compared to some other hotels I have stayed in china. The quality of all equipments in hotels and in room is quite good. Stayed at a grand deluxe room on the 43rd floor and the view was great but we thought the room was large enough but at the same time, it could be a bit more comfortable. As soon as we walked in we thought the room smelled a bit &quot;humid&quot;. Then we understood why. There is a very nice large GROHE curtain shower head in the bathroom in the same area with the bath tub. The whole floor of that area is wet when you are taking a shower which is harder to dry compared to a normal bathroom. Its comfortable to take a shower overlooking shanghai but at the same time, I like to have a towel on the floor while exiting the tub instead of a slipery wet floor.I am not sure I like the room layout with this bathroom / room connection (at least not like this).The restaurants are lovely but very overpriced according to china standards. The bar on the 65th floor offers some of the best views in shanghai. For its excellent location, right in nanjing road, I would probably go back but not without checking what other options I could find in shanghai. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Great Stay at a Price Stayed at the Le Meridian as well as the Four Seasons and JC Mandarin during this trip. Great Room moderate value relative to some other hotels.Location: The Le Meridian is located on Nanjing road. This is good or baddepending on what you're looking for. Nanjing is always busy and crowded with people. Lot of low and middle end shops to explore. If you stand out as a tourist you should expect to be approached by folks. Can be annoying when you get approached by so called &quot;local students&quot; looking to have you spend money at an expensive tea house. Walking distance to the Bund.Room: The Le Meridian room is new. Modern studio style. Looks like a modern bachelor pad. Plasma TV. Walk in shower with window into the living area so you can watch tv through the window while taking a shower. Great room with good view.The Le Meridian had a lot of folks but The Le Meridian had a lot of folks but and had good service as well but didn't seem as mature as the Four Seasons.Cost/Value: Le Meridian ran 1650 RMB through their website. Four seasons was cheaper if you stay longer. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fabulous hotel! Just returned from a long weekend at Le Royal Meridien with two friends. We found a great deal through a local travel agent (HK$3,200 for flights + 3 nights) and although we read the reviews before booking, were still really impressed by the quality and location of the hotel. The whole look and feel is ultra modern and luxurious. The rooms are comfortable, the rain shower is amazing, the pool is bright but tranquil with comfortable loungers and the 66th floor bar is a must-see (girls...try the Coconut martini, served by male models shipped in for Ladies night each Friday)! There's a great little gift shop in the lobby, which sells everything you'd find in Shanghai Tang for a fraction of the price. Pick up a copy of &quot;That's Shanghai&quot; (free local mag) for local restaurant and bar listings. There didn't seem to be much to visit other than the museum, the old town and the Bund (give the tunnel a miss). If you're looking for great dumplings, go to Din Tai Fung in Xintiandi! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Loved it! We stayed for 5 nights in a Deluxe Club room which included breckfast. The rate with taxes seemed pretty high to us (about A$320 a night) and I had some concerns as to whether we'd get value for money, but in the end we went with the Trip Advisor recommendations and went for it. We were so glad we did! This hotel is fantastic. The room was spacious, the view fabulous, the bed comfy, the toiletries (L'Occitane) wonderful, the in-room tea selection great. The non-smoking floor really was non smoking. In some hotels I can take or leave the Club facilities but in this hotel they were of a very high standard. We had breckfast in the Club room every morning overlooking the Bund and the food selelction was great. Evening cocktail hour provided a nice selection of canapes, pastries and drinks - they were generous with their food which is always a nice thing. Internet facilities in the Clube lounge are free. The staff service was excellent, they really went out of their way to assist us in every way possible, and this included the posting of three very large and unweildy packages - they provided boxes, packing materials, tape and information regarding postage, and took the boxes to the post office for us after we checked out.A lot of people who have written reviews here have had issues with the position of the lobby and the various elevator banks needed to get from one section of the hotel to the next. Really, its not a big deal - certainly not big enough to warrant NOT staying at the hotel.Would I return? Can't wait! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Enjoyed our stay We were originally booked to stay at the Westin Hotel but changed to the Le Roayl Meridien because friends advised us that the location was more convenient which it certainly is. The hotel is lovely but you must like modern as opposed to a traditional decor. Other reviewers complained about the lobby not being on the main floor. This is common in many hotels throughout China. The hotel check in was fast and convenient. However even in a five star hotel many staff behind the reception desk do not understand English. They are friendly, however communicating was difficult. When we asked the concierge for the location of a store that was located about 300 feet from the hotel, no one knew of the store or could tell us where it was. I read that the standard room was small and I thought it would not be that big a problem however it was. We had five suitcases for two people and we could only fit one suitcase in the closet. The room lacks space to put anything away. The sink allows room for a toothbrush and that is about it. The shower in the standard room is impossible to use because the water flows right onto the floor with no ledge to prevent the water from flowing all over the bathroom. We asked for an upgrade and after several hours of arguing they finally moved us to another room. If you are traveling alone and have a minimal amount of luggage the standard room is fine. It is not comfortable for two people. The buffet breakfast is amazing, the food in the same restaurant for lunch was average. The pool and gym are also excellent. The hotel has an abundance of staff who stand by the elevators to greet you and push the elevator button for you. What we found uncomfortable was when you eat your meals, several staff stand inches from your side the entire time. The waiter did not leave our side until we placed our order and someone stands at your side to fill your water glass at all times. We could not get them to understand that we needed some privacy during the meal. When we went to check out we called ahead of time to have our luggage picked up. No one came to get the luggage. We callled two more times and still no one came. We took our 5 suticases down to the lobby ourselves. The bell boy loaded one suitcase into the cab for us and when we tipped him $2.00 US, he gave us a very dirty look. Most of the staff at the hotel were very polite, however they have to improve their service. Considering the ratio of staff to hotel guest, there is no excuse for having to transport our own luggage. Our friends stayed at the JW Marriott and they recommended that hotel. They also need to find staff who speak english and can assist tourists and not just Chinese businessmen. Even though we enjoyed our stay, with so many 5 star hotels to chose from, I would try another hotel instead. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent all round I booked this hotel through a travel agent, and emailed the hotel directly for airport pickup (for RMB600), they promptly replied within hours and someone was there waiting for us when we exit from the arrivals area. The ride took about 50mins and upon arriving at the hotel, a hotel rep greeted us and escorted us to our room and showed us all the amenities for our suite (with excellent english!) The room was huge with a plasma TV that could swirl around 360 degrees from the bed to the sitting area. One incident occured to me (which made me understand why LeMeridien tops the many other 5 star hotel in Shanghai). There was a long taxi queue waiting outside the hotel (weekend and raining at 6.30pm!) by the look of the queue, we had to wait at least 30mins, however, the bell boy suggested that we could share a limo (Audi A6) with 2 other passenger for 20RMB each, of course we gladly accept! On returning from another 5*hotel, there was - of course again a long taxi queue, and at 10.30pm, the metro is already closed, and everyone started getting annoyed and totally ignored the queue, the bell boy just couldn't handle the situation and disappeared!! I went into the hotel and complained and asked how much would it cost to hire a limo, they quoted me RMB400 (Taxi would only cost 16RMB!!) and told me theres ALWAYS a long queue and they cant do anything about it!!! It just shows they dont care if theres a war outside whereas LeMeridien offered us a quick solution!The hotel's location is excellent, right next to People Square and the shopping of Nanjing Road, the hotel floors starts at 11 and below the hotel is a department store and theres a supermarket on the ground floor where you can get some water, snacks etc (A bottle of Evian is 45RMB in the hotel!)Breakfast has plenty of choices and I ordered room service once and food arrived in 20mins.This is really the hotel to stay in Shanghai! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Can't beat the location I stayed at this hotel while it was still in a trial operation period, so the package (air/hotel) I got from HK was excellent value. The location of the hotel is amazing, right at the west end of the Nanjing Road pedestrian walk. It is also just a three minute walk from the People's Square subway stop where two major subway lines intersect. So it is possible to take the highspeed train from the airport in Pudong, change to the subway and reach the hotel for about 80RMB, half what a taxi would cost and if luggage is not an issue. However, because it is relatively new, and that its front lobby is sort of out of sight, off to a side street, most cab drivers in Shanghai did not know where it is. Most cab drivers in Shanghai are not native Shanghaiese but that is a different topic all together. The room is very nice, love the shower/bath, and the layout is very well designed. It has a nice indoor pool and gym. I asked for fresh coffee cream (10%) at the lobby bar/restaurant, but got 18% table cream in a wine glass from the kitchen. On one hand, diary products are still foreign to Chinese and it was 10pm and not very busy. On the other, this is Le Royal Meridien. Well, at least the staff tried hard. I guess it justified my fantastic rates. I did try to show my SPG membership card, but never did get the points. I guess it is because I paid the travel agent, not directly to the hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"I love this hotel This hotel is definitely a five star hotel in terms of service, amenities, decor, and location. Shanghai was the last leg of our China vacation and so we had a lot of places to compare it to. It is a five star hotel (by American standards). The entire staff speaks english fluently and are very helpful in guiding you around the city. We were upgraded to a high floor with absolutely amazing views of Nanjing Road, which is literally outside the hotel door. It was so relaxing here. It still had the new hotel feel to it and everyone was eager to please.The only criticisms that I would have is that taxis did not seem to know where this hotel was. It was frustrating to get into a taxi and try to explain where it is even when we gave them the hotel card. The good thing is the hotel is very distinctive looking -- just look for the building with flashing dotted lines. As other travellers mentioned, on the higher floors, you have to switch elevators -- but this is no big deal.Also, we were interrupted in the evenings several times by the staff asking if everything was alright. It is nice that they check on guests but annoying when you have to answer the door a couple of times a night. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"An Absolutely Wonderful Experience! I spend about 250 nights a year in hotels and The LeMeridien Shanghai is one of the best hotel's I've stayed in. Not only is the property brand, spanking new, but it's in the heart of virtually everything you'd want to do during your visit to Shanghai. The staff is simply wonderful and caters to your every beck and call. If you're a Starwood Preferred Guest, you'll love the wonderful breakfast and evening buffet spreads. In addition, the design of the Royal Club Lounge makes relaxing an absolute pleasure. If you're going to Shanghai, stay at the LeMeridien-you won't be disappointed! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Location The best thing about this hotel was the room and the location. We were upgraded to a room on the 34th floor with a view of the city on both sides. The bath tub faced the Bund - it was amazing. The location is perfect. Good for walking right off the hotel door to major attractions and shops.On the down side, the hotel lobby feels very big. They have lots of employees directing guests as one tends to get a bit lost. Reception is on the 11th floor. One must take a few elevators to arrive at the destination. The Chinese restaurant is very good, the spa OK and the hairdresser a bargain ($10 for a hair wash and blow dry). The business center is expensive. We used an internet cafe near by in order to avoid silly prices for internet access.Overall I liked this hotel a lot. But the common areas are not cosy by any means. There's a lot of noise, music going on etc. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Le Royal Meridien - THE place to stay in Shanghai Quite simply, the Le Royal Meridien Shanghai is THE place to stay in Shanghai. Le Meridien has the perfect combination of a brilliant new property, outstanding service, and a terrific location, convenient located in the heart of Shanghai.During our four day stay we never had a worry. Our connecting room for our children was perfectly situated. Every request for service was immediately and accurately acted upon. The pool and exercise facilities are terrific.Pros- well appointed, new rooms- courteous service, greeted by staff throughout the hotel- great location for Nanjing shopping- diverse breakfast buffet, outstanding food - attractive pool and exercise facilitiesCons- hotel lobby located on 20th floor, must switch elevators at lobby level to get to guest rooms "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Impeccable location excellent amenities Le Royal Meridien caught my attention on the web when it first opened last November. We had a pleasant stay at the end of June for 4 days.First of all, the lift arrangement is not as complicated as some reviews indicated. one set of lifts from street level to the lobby floor, then two different sets of elevators to mid floor rooms, or higher floor rooms. There are ample staff at the lift foyer to show directions.The location of the hotel is central esp for those who want to have a first-hand encounterance with Shanghai, instead of staying remoted and tour shanghai from your private car windows. People's Square Station is just acorss the street, Nanjing Road pedestrian street is 2-min away. From the Bar 789 on 66th floor, you can enjoy one of the best panoramic views of shanghai. For Y2,500 you can have a private area for your group have drinks facing the Pudong/River view, if you have a party of 6-8 which is definitely worth it.The service- overall it is excellent-courteous and friendly, from the bell service to reception desk. Concierge is helpful. Housekeeping is friendly and helpful. They did a good job on the complimentary shoe-shine after a long day of walk in he rural side. The only flaw is a few of the female servers in the Le Bristrot display a poker face every morning!! The room is spacious, a good size desk facing the floor to ceiling window offer view of the city, for upgrade deluxe or Club you may have the Bund view.Open concept in washbasin area, many glass shelves for your personal toileteries. separate toilet and tub/shower.You can enjoy TV or the view of the city while you take a shower or bath by raising the electric blinds on the glass petition separating the bathroom and the sitting area. 42 LCD TV w dvd players. Bathrobe, ample space in closet/wardrobe. Immaculate hardware.The sumptuous breakfast at the Le Bistrot on the lobby floor offers a wide variety of food. The restaurant has ample of staff but not a very good start of a day with some unfriendly female servers.The price of lunch in the French restaurant is great, but not the food and service.Overall - as a 9-month old hotel, it is excellent. Yet time will prove if the excellence endures while many hotels in China ignore the importance of maintence. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Splendid Hotel and Views Very impersonal service Le Royal Meridien Shanghai is one of the city's best hotels, as far as food, design, location and architecture go. I's a place that's great to come back to, but lacks that personal touch and welcome that makes the difference between a great experience and an unforgettable one.Location: right in the heart of the city at People’s Square. The only other quality hotel in Shanghai that can claim that honor is the JW Marriott, but still the Le Meridien’s location is even more central. To the immediate north is the Nanjing East Road pedestrian street, a must stop for every visitor. Enjoy the great lights at night, but beware of the pimps that tout lady bars and other things just out the hotel’s back door. Just to the south is an old, pre-Revolutionary Christian church that’s fun to photograph, and next to that, Shanghai’s shopping mall for the masses, Raffle’s Plaza. Loads of restaurants, clothing stores, and even a Cold Stone Creamery there. To the west is People’s Park, with the Grand Theater, Urban Planning Museum (check out the huge model of Shanghai on the 3rd floor, where you can see every building in the main city area in miniature), Museum of Modern Art (MOCA), and the Shanghai Art Museum. The Shanghai History Museum is a 10 minute walk away at People’s Square, and that’s a place where one can spend several hours enjoying the well gathered exhibits. Under People's Square is a big clothing and fashion market that can be a lot of fun with the right crowd of girls.Restaurants: The buffets are really good all around, especially for Shanghai. Allure, the French restaurant, is managed by a very charming French woman, Fanny, and the food there is tasty and nicely presented, especially the white truffle soup. Try the business set lunch for a great value on 3 courses. The Chinese restaurant is nothing special, with my Chinese friends telling me that the food lacked the delicate flavors of real Guangdong dishes, and the Italian restaurant Favola has quality creations, but lacks “special.” I recommend an upgrade to the club floor to enjoy the all day drinks, afternoon tea, evening cocktails and appetizers; it’s a great deal.Rooms: Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city; it’s romantic, fascinating, invigorating, and one of the things that makes this hotel so special. Just come on a day that the windows are clean. Rooms feel a little small, but are very comfortable with nice touches like fancy French toiletries, large LCD TVs, and cloudlike beds. The bathrooms are nice, except that the shower has a door stop in it that seems to have been strategically placed for toe stubbings. Tread softly. There are no places to hang towels in the bathrooms; I had to set mine on the rim of the bathtub and feel around to find it after my shower.Health Club: Great atrium style pool, idyllic terrace overlooking People’s Park, and super comfortable hot tubs in all the right places. The gym is a real gym too, one that makes working out look attractive. The thing I don’t like though is that the changing rooms are downstairs and a bit of a walk from the pool and gym. It feels strange walking down stairs, and then down a long hallway, all the while dripping wet and a little chilly from the very cold air conditioning. Complaints: This hotel has about 700 rooms, and it sure feels like it. Staff seem busy and preoccupied, with a no nonsense business-like air about them. The smiles don’t feel much different than those one gets at the office; lots of politeness, but little sincerity. Even though the surroundings are incredible, I miss genuine smiles and a staff who seem happy I’m there. As it’s still a new hotel, it’s likely that Le Royal Meridien Shanghai will mature into the fantastic place it’s meant to be. It just might take another year or two. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fantastic Stayed here for 7 nights when on businessStayed at a club room, which was well worth it as the buffet and drinks all day are superbThe leisure faclities are one of the best i have seen. Hot tub looking over the Shanghai skyline is picturesqueRoom was very nice also with fantasic shower and nice 42&quot; plasmaLocation is the key tooOnly downfall was the series of lifts needed to use to get around hotel bt you get used to it after a whileOverall truely great experience "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel This hotel has got to be in the best location in Shanghai , very central to Nanjing Rd and the Bund, although taxi is very cheap in Shanghai, its nice to be able to walk to many attractions. Hotel is brand spanking new, rooms are spacious and ultra modern. Luxurious beds and linens. Breakfast is vast and caters for all tastes and most nationalities. The bar in the 66 floor is a must, the most spectacular views of the city and great cocktails too their snacks menu could improve though. Dont bother going to the Grand Hyatt cloud 9 for drinks if you are staying at this hotel because the view is better from the 66 floor of the Le Royal Meridien. Grand Hyatt is too high and very small windows which restrict the view. Nice indoor pool also and Gym. One of the best chinese restaurants in Shanghai is in the hotel but unfortunantly we did not have dinner there, we arrived too late and the restaurant closed at 10pm. The fish tanks just before you enter the restaurant are awsome! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Top of the Line This top of the line hotel, a few blocks from the riverfront Bund area, did not disappoint. Our club level room on the 55th floor provided a magnificent view of the city lights (through the smog) and was perfectly appointed. We couild not have asked for better service from the attentive staff. Breakfast each morning on the 44th floor club level provided another perspective of the city skyline. The open bar and hors d'oevres available each afternoon made the extra expense a bargain, if that word can be used in connection with a hotel of this caliber. We did negotiate a significant price concession for 3 rooms over a 4-night stay.We found the dim sum restaurant at the hotel to have a huge variety of dishes for lunch. An evening meal at the top rated M on the Bund, a rooftop restaurant, left us disappointed. We much preferrred Ye Shanghai in the French concession area--a sort of Georgetown in China, where the massive construction underway throughout the city does not intrude.The staff has some difficulty with English, but the government's recent emphasis on English in the schools should help with this problem over the next several years. We were surprised to find the computers for Internet access were using apparently unauthorized versions of the Windows operating system. Overall, a great stay. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Now in full swing I have stayed in this hotel twice now.First in nov, second in apr.In november i was only there for a day, hotel rooms and amenities are better than can be inspected.U dont have to ask for things to be sent to room such as iron and ironing board, umbrella etc. Deco and design make this hotel look stunning. 42inch tv is very nice. As is the bathtub and rainshower... Staff were very confused in november, but not suprising considering the hotel just opened. Seems to have changed now, my check in was efficient and staff were helpful and willing to talk.I headed back to the westin after my nov visit but after this visit the meridien is my hotel of choiceMy SuggestionsBusiness travelers: Get a royal club room. If u are meeting anyone for business you can use their 8 person meeting rooms in the club floor for 2 hours complimentary.Long Stay: standard rooms seem a little small unless if your in and out. executive suite are a nice and comfortable size. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Simply the best! Though it has only been open just over 6 months, Le Royal Meridien must be the premier hotel in Shanghai. It is big (and tall at 66 storeys), beautiful and perfectly located. And incredibly for such a young hotel, the staff are almost uniformly efficient and friendly.The rooms are gorgeous and functional (though a few more drawers would have been nice) and the views incomparable.The spa and fitness center are world class.The main restaurant buffet is excellent but the restaurant that will be winning awards is Allure (French cuisine).I can't think of anything that is wrong with this hotel! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great location good hotel facilites only fair service Stayed here the first time though passed by last October. Location is excellent: at the start of Nanjing Pedestrain Street and the edge of People's Square. Close to Subway stations, and taxis are not too difficult to come by. Hotel is still very new (opened in Sept 2006?), so facilities are in good shape. Rooms are fair in size, though I find the room at the JW Marriott (similar skyscraper across the Square) bigger. 42&quot; LCD is a nice touch. Bathroom is now an area within the room, without formal partition. Shower and bathtub are combined into one compartment, with &quot;rainfall-type&quot; shower, and a DEEP and LONG tub (VERY nice touch). The &quot;compartment&quot; is only separated with the living area by a glass, so you could be fully visible to whoever's in the room (don't worry, there's a curtain should you want more privacy). Toilet is in another compartment. I personally prefer the bathroom be in a completely separated room. Private business IS private business, afterall. I got a so-so view of the Square on a lower floor, but views from the high floors are excellent, as I checked out from the 66th floor bar/lounge. Service quality is so-so. Always got this sort of poor attitude from Chinese hotels. That was especially evident from the Concierge and the service people at the lobby restaurant.Lift arrangement is also a hassle. It always seems to be a bit confusing which lift goes where.But with all that taken into account, considering the location and the quality of the facility, it was a great price I paid. Cheaper than JW Marriott / Westin / Ritz-Carlton. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Private holidays in the centre of Shanghai I stayed here beginning April, 5 for 5 nights.For the additional comfort of the Royal Club Lounge located on floor 44 and personal Butler service I decided for a Royal Club room. The service is top-end and I enjoyed this stay very much.Because of 138 Royal Club rooms they offer a good breakfast with a lot of different choices at the spacious Royal Club Lounge.I missed a bit a typical chinese breakfast. The buffet breakfast was a typical french Meridien breakfast and I missed the local influence.From 5.30 pm to 8 pm they offer a Cocktail hour with warm and cold snacks, pastries and chocolates. There is also a good beverage presentation offering international vines, Moet&amp;Chandon Champagne, Cognac, Cocktails...Personal Butler service includes packing and unpacking of clothes, personal wake-up call with coffee at your room and concierge services. There are also computers with free internet access at this lounge. During the day, they offer beverage service with coffee or tea and non-alcoholic drinks.The room itself is spacious (38 sqm.) with open bathroom and separate toilet.The location is the best for tourists because it is directly on the most famous shopping street, Nanjing Road.I tried &quot;Ai Mei&quot; Restaurant for chinese meals and &quot;Allure&quot; for French gourmet cuisine. At chinese restaurant, prices are on a lower level with very good value for money.The french restaurant is upscale, more personal service and, of course, higher prices than the chinese restaurant.The bar is located on three top floors with panoramic views and a good choice of Martini cocktails.It was a memorable stay for me and I highly recommend this modern, french style and very luxurious hotel. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great hotel excellent location - the place to stay in Shangahi Stayed here on my second trip to Shangahi (last time stayed at Westin Bund Center). Very happy overall with the hotel. It's in an excellent location downtown close to the subway and other major attractions. Since I'm a Platinum member with Starwood was upgraded to a suite on arrival on the 56th floor with great views of Shanghai and Tomorrow Square. Room was more like a Junior Suite than a suite, since the bedroom wasn't walled off but it was still very nice. TV did a nice swivel thing that rotated it 180 degrees from bed viewing to living area viewing. Bathroom was nice and updated with a very large shower and jacuzzi tub.I had access to the lounge and it was nice, though food spread was a bit disappointing for what I has experienced at other Starwood top tier hotels, but still great. Staff was excellent and extremely accommodating. A bellboy even walked with my partner over to a tailor about 15 minutes away to get his pants hemmed and translated. Very helpful and very genuinely nice people.I would definitely stay here again, though its a tough choice between Le Royal Meridien, St. Regis and Westin Bund. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great Hotel I've stayed at numerous hotels in Shanghai over the last few years from the Grand Hyatt, The Westin and The Portman Ritz Carlton, and the LMR is truly top of list. I'm a business traveler and this hotel not only caters to the globetrotting businessman but would also be a fantastic hotel for a holiday get-away or leisure traveler. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the Bund right on Nanjing Rd and adjacent to the People's Park. There are three subway stops nearby; one within about a 100 yard walk from the entrance to the hotel. In terms of location this hotel is very well the best situated in the area from my perspective. Outside of the hotel lobby are several restaurants and cafes including a Subway. The hotel itself can be summed up by one word: Grand. The lifts were not as confusing as some previous reviews indicate although there are not a set of elevators that serve all floors. The rooms were extremely functional, contemporary and pleasant. The windows span one entire wall of the room and are floor to ceiling which when paired with a room on the east side of the hotel give a wonderful view of Nanjing Road, the Bund and even PuDong. Rooms contain large plasma televisions, rainforest showers, extremely comfortable beds and efficient desks which face the large window. There are several restaurants in the hotel. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet served in the all-day dining restaurant adjacent to the main lobby. My favorite restaurant in the hotel is an Italian restaurant called Favola. I ate dinner there four nights of my trip, and given my knowledge of Shanghai and great eateries, this is a fantastic accolade to the staff, the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. I actually enjoyed staying in at the hotel. They have great leg of lamb and have a great selection of flat crust pizzas. While the wine list was sufficient, I was a bit surprised that they lacked what I would describe medium priced wines. They had a lot of choices sub-$100 and many listings +$500, not a lot in between which surprised me for such a great hotel. The staff at the restaurant is why I returned so many nights in a row. They were quick, responsive and extremely cordial. I had many great conversations with the wait staff as well as the hostess. The hotel also has a very nice spa and fitness center. While I did not use the spa, I did take a tour and based on appearances it reminded me of the spa at the Westin Hotel in Shanghai. The fitness center was great, clean and kept at a pleasing temperature which is something that many hotels do not pay attention to. They have a very nice lap pool; bring your goggles, they don't have any to rent and it will set you back $30 to purchase a pair. At the top of the hotel is a three story bar that offers amazing 360 views of Shanghai. It’s a great place to kick back with a drink and a cigar after a long day at the office or visiting business partners. Pros:- Great staff and friendly, efficient rooms with great beds.- Well decorated.- Great location in PuXi- Favola restaurant and the fitness center.Cons:- Buffet was a little expensive for someone who eats a small breakfast. There is a coffee shop adjacent to the main lobby entrance to the hotel if your breakfast is a simple coffee and bagel or muffin.- It can be inconvenient at times to have to use different sets of elevators to move about the hotel from the main entrance up to the 65th floor. My recommendation is to use the same sets of elevators during your whole stay. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Minor flaws but overall a great stay! Stayed here for 4 nights in early March on business. Hotel is ultra-modern and very beautiful. Rooms are immaculate and the beds are other-worldly. Location on Nanjing Rd. is prime. Only a few minor flaws: The lobby is located on the 11th floor and rooms are located on 20 - 65. However, the trip to your room could require 3 separate elevator rides depending on your location. The shower head placement is awkward in some bathrooms and there are just too many greeters (perhaps some will like the extra attention). Overall, this was a wonderful hotel and a great springboard for our exploration into Shanghai. They also arranged a great tour of Shangha for us. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Gorgeous but price varies We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February 2007 at only $100USD per night (which we found through a Hong Kong based travel agent from a website that is the equivalent to those online hotel discount websites based in the U.S., which had it at $200USD per night. The hotel room was large, clean, very modern and definitely a bargain for the $100 per night. View from the floor to ceiling windows was great (despite the cloudy weather). Housekeeping needs were fufilled very quickly upon a phone call, the front desk staff are professional, proficient and friendly. Location of the hotel is very good. It's true you need a different set of elevators to go to the rooms, but there is always someone there to direct you to the right set of elevators and it isn't rocket science. We had a tour guide and car for the three days so cannot comment on proximity to mass transit. Hotel restaurants seemed overpriced and never were clear as to whether the 15% &quot;service charge&quot; was considered gratuity for the waiter or not. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"great hotel Just returned from a six day stay at le royal meridien shanghai. What a great hotel. Will definately stay here again. Fantastic location, lots of things to do and see within walking distance. (although taxis are very cheap if you want to venture further) We didn't have any problems with taxi drivers finding the place as some have mentioned previously. Also the lifts were never a problem as there was always staff there to help. (but they didn't take much working out anyway) Excellent, friendly service from hotel staff. I don't think they could have possibly been more helpful. (They even have an outdoor heater to keep customers warm whilst you are waiting for them to call you a taxi!) Rooms are very modern with plasma tv and dvd player. Great views from floor to ceiling windows. Only down side was that we found there was not quite enough storage space for clothes.We had a club room which gave free internet use in the club lounge. Also snacks and drinks throughout the day. Good for afternoon tea and cakes, and pre dinner drinks!Also, we booked the hotel car to pick us up from the airport and although our flight arrived an hour early the driver was there to greet us. Overall very impressed. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,Good Hotel Good Location I recently stayed at this brand new hotel for business and would definitely recommend it to other business or leisure travelers. The rooms are nice and modern although a bit smaller than I expected. Some nice surprises about the rooms: see through glass window between the shower room and bed room; good reading lights on the bed and L'Occitane amenities. The only complaint I have about the room is the bed which is too soft for me. The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location. It's located at Nanjing Road and close to People's Square where you can find abundant shopping and restaurants.The buffet breakfast has a wide selection of food but the quality is so so. 
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Brand spanking new hotel decent location Stayed in Le Royal Meridien a month after its opening. The hotel takes up the top half of an office tower, with a shopping centre block at the base of the tower. The interior is modern - although the design might perhaps be better served by a little more understatement. The location next to the People's Park is excellent - the hotel is right next to a major Metro station as well as one of Shanghai's major shopping streets. Being so new, it is a good idea to keep the hotel number on speed dial in case you need the concierge to direct your taxi driver.Service was attentive, although English competence was at best functional in most of the staff. (I have made the point before that anyone with better English would probably be working in better-paying jobs, so the situation is not intolerable) Staff were eager to please and very attentive, although there were some kinks to be sorted out e.g. when I checked out no one knew what to do with the Express Checkout card I passed to the reception.The room had a decent view and was reasonably sized. It was outfitted with a plasma TV and all the other features that one would expect from an international 5-star hotel chain. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Excellent 6 star hotel in a the best location We stayed here for 6 nights. Great hotel, fabulous location for shopping and eating. Food is cheap and of an excellent standard. You can safely eat at restaurants outside the hotel. Hotel food was good too---but nothing fantastic. I would rather eat the real chinese food outside. The rooms are comfortable and we were on a high floor so the views were sensational. The huge plasma was just great for the kids. We went by taxi everywhere and it was not expensive at all. Go to Old Town and eat in the famous restaurant upstairs where they serve the best dumplings in town. They also sell these beautiful dumplings on the ground floor through a little window (It's not the teahouse on the lake). This is shanghai's most famous dumpling restaurant and should not be missed. We enjoyed our stay in Shanghai and at this hotel. However, I think the staff lack experience for a 5 star hotel and you do need to spell everything out for them. Do not expect that they can meet unexpected needs quickly---eg., sheets for the sofabed for our kids--should have been there already. Extra towels for the kids everyday. Asking for directions anywhere is a bit irritating. Just be patient and don't be surprised how much time you have to wait for your questions to be answered--noone thinks independently in this hotel. They do speak english--the concierge Jimmy was excellent but not everyone can speak or understand english well. Overall, an excellent hotel that is beautifully appointed with a fantastic pool, spa and fitness centre. Rooms are very comfortable and quiet. I would stay here again but I would not expect the typical 5 star service. They try hard but they don't have the experience to make their service top notch. It's almost there but not quite. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"modern and nice A very nice hotel in an outstanding location at the beginning of the Nanjing road. Modern design everywhere, nice staff, very good buffet restaurant and great swimming pool.Room is ok but not as nice as Meridien Hong Kong. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Fab hotel in fab city Everything was perfect. At the start I was worried that I will get the same experience with FlyOneWorld with the pickup at the airport. But thankfully the hotel representative was present when I got out of the Customs counter. The trip to the hotel was uneventful, very smooth, and atleast the car was packed with the standard amenities. When I got out of the car, I was greeted by doormen who were eager to take everything from my hands. When I stepped in the hotel, I was greeted by one of the &quot;ushers&quot; (well I don't actually know what they are supposed to do) by my name. She then escorted me to the reception on the 20th floor. Check-in was smooth and everything seemed to be in order. Then even upgraded my room to a higher floor, with a fabulous view of the Bund and Najing Road. The room was also great, the size is okay, a little small compared to the other hotels I've stayed in, but it doesn't feel cramped, I guess the absence of walls enclosing the bathroom did the trick and the mirror doors of the cabinet makes the room feel bigger. Of course you have the 42 inch Plasma TV which is now a standard for all new/newly renovated hotel rooms. All the rooms have DVD players too which could come in handy for watching your new pirated DVDs...hahahahahaha. I also like the fact that they provide L'occitane products so I don't have to carry mine everytime I go there. Hotel breakfast is suffient, but quite redudant, I guess I'm used to breakfast buffet spreads here which could run for a week without a repeat of food (outside the standard, eggs, bacon, sauages and bread). Plus atleast they have provided bigger glasses for the juices, usually hotels provide small glasses for that.Then you have the 2 sets elevators, one takes you from the ground floor to the 20th floor lobby and one from the lobby to the rooms. There is another set of elevators that brings guests from the lobby to the lower floors that takes you to the function rooms and the outlets. On the 2nd day I found that there were 2 elevators that take the guests from the ground floor to rooms on the 40th floor and up. (but you cannot take them going down to the ground)When I was there taxis are quite familiar with the hotel already so I didn't experience alot of the problems the other reviewers experienced. The whole hotel experience was simply fabulous, though sometimes you would feel that the hotel is crowded because of the number of staff, at normal hours you would have about 4-6 people manning the elevator lobby, I don't even have to press the button because they would do everything for you....and sometime by the time you get of the elevator and reach the coffee shop for breakfast you would have greeted and been greeted &quot;good morning&quot; to at least half a dozen people.I would definitely stay here again...looking forward to go back to Shanghai soon! "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Re : Modern and Nice Hotel Stayed for 3 nights at a Royal Club Room in December 06. This is a brand new hotel located in Nanjing Road, the prime shopping district of Shanghai. The hotel has a modern contemporary decor that is tastefully designed. I stayed during the low season so there weren't many guests. Most of the time, you seem to see more hotel employees then guests. The room is nicely appointed with modern decor though slightly on the small side. The bathroom design is a bit strange in that it is a open concept so while you walk into the room, you also walk pass and can see the washing basin, the bathroom and toilet. OK with me but some people might not like this layout. Room come with complete amenities and feature a 42&quot; plasma TV, spacious working desk, king size bed. Bathroom is well equipped with a deep soaking bathtub, overhead rain shower and L'Occitane toiletries. Moreover, most rooms have a good view of the Shanghai skyline. Mine come with a great view of the People's square and the Shanghai museum. Overall not much to complain about the room. To nitpick, internet connection is not really fast enough, the sound-proof is not that great ( can hear at night when doors were being closed hard ) and the water pressure could have been stronger. Room service menu lacks variety. The executive lounge ( called the Royal Club lounge ) is beautifully appointed and very chic and spacious. It is filled with comfortable sofas. There are 2 food presentations a day, which is breakfast and evening cocktail. And free drinks (non-alcoholic) throughout the day. I had most of my business meeting in the lounge since it is quiet and offers a lot of privacy. Like what many reviewers have pointed out, the hotel floor design is quirky. The main entrance hall is not along the hotel's address, and the lobby, entrance hall and restaurants are all on different levels. Couple that with a maze-like layout and 3 sets of lifts and many staircases, visitors and hotel guest get easily confused and loss. Fortunately, the hotel seems to be keenly aware of this problem and have their staff stationed at most common areas of the hotel and they are keen to help and give directions. So whenever I want to go anywhere within the hotel, I just asked the staff at hand for directions. Because it is winter, I ate mostly in the hotel's restuarants. The chinese restaurant food is very average althought not too expensive. The cafe serve a very good selection during lunch and dinner buffet and the price is very reasonable. One can see many locals also frequent the cafe for the buffet. Service is overall very good but inconsistent. Some staff are more polite and eager to help then others. The staff are the Executive lounge are among the best. Still, in a city that is well known for sub-par hotel service, this is miles better than the service we got from 3 to 4 star hotels in Shangahi. One more thing, if you can afford to pay higher, go for the hotel airport limousane service or rent a limousane from a car-rental company instead and avoid using local taxi. That's because most taxi drivers in Shanghai tend to drive like hell riders especially on a highway. Pudong airport is about 1 hour journey from the hotel and the risk of accident increases. My taxi ride from the hotel to the airport was rather nerve wrecking with several close calls until I was forced to tell the taxi driver and insist he slow down. If you don't mind the quirks, this is a above average hotel and deserving of its 5-star status. I will not mind staying there again. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Great hotel After the Peninsula in Bangkok, this is the best hotel I have stayed in. I had a corner room with the TV on a pull out swivel for the couch and the bed, a nice touch. The elevators are a little confusing, but there are more than enough hotel staff to guide you around. I found no problem with the quality of my bathroom. The bed is fantastic.As mentioned before though, be careful with taxi's. I had the address in Chinese for the taxi driver from SHA and he still got lost. The hotel website said the cost should be about 65 Yuan. Mine was 120 Yuan. I mentioned this to the bellman when he opened the door of the taxi for me. He quickly went to the driver and got the cost down to 80 Yuan. A job well done! I also think the driver took the long way because the driver back to the airport took a different freeway. They should all know how too at least get to Nanjing Road. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"Doesn't Get Better than Le Royal Meridien We stayed here for three nights in early November five weeks after it had opened. The rooms are exquisite in taste, design and comfort. I usually don't like buffets, but the dinner buffets were absolutely amazing. There is no question that we will stay here on our next Shanghai trip. "
le royal meridien shanghai ,"A stylish place I spent four nights on the club level. The staff was welcoming and the rooms large and well appointed. It is right on People's Square, with the subway just a short walk away, and the shopping of Nanking Road at the door. From my point of view it was a very conventient locaiton. My only complaint was the configuration of the elevators. You took one elevator from the ground floor to the hotel lobby, another one from the lobby to your room, and if you wanted to eat in one of the hotel restaurautns you need to go back to the ground floor and take yet another one up to the restauraunt level. That minor annoyance aside, I will come back next time I'm in Shanghai.As other reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is new and not evey taxi driver knows where it is so if you're planning on taking a taxi from the airport I'd email the hotel and ask for the hotel name and address in Chinese.

majesty plaza shanghai ,Service Poor service for a hotel that I expected to be world class. 
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Brilliant location for shops and sightseeing. Large room, nice toiletries. clean bathroom. We stayed on the 18th floor so good view of other skyscrapers. Hotel has precipitous view over central balconies to the 7th floor below. Rooms are round the edge and space in centre of hotel from 7th to 25th floor. swimming pool on 7th floor looked good but we didn't have our swimming caps with us so could not go in. Probably could have bought one but we didn't ask. Breakfast buffet was a good selection of varying cuisines.Excellent location as on main high street for shopping although you get harassed the minute you walk out by people trying to sell you stuff. Can walk to the Shanghai museum about 30 mins and also to the river. The sightseeing tunnel to the Bund is an interesting underground monorail with a light show on the way. Shops stay open till 9.30 and a little electric train runs up and down the highstreet if your feet get tired. 2 yuan for a single journey "
majesty plaza shanghai ,Great Location ; Not Very Impressive Hotel This hotel is great for its location ; pricewise it's moderate in comparison to the other offerings along Nanjing Road. I booked the Deluxe room and it comes with a nice sitting room area ; furnishings are very old in design although well maintained. The room is very big and decent for the RMB 1100 I paid.Check in is efficient. The biggest selling point is the location. The hotel is right in the middle of the Nanjing Road shopping area and is great for exploring the area. THere is a better alternative that i stayed at Citadines Jinqiao...read that review ! Breakfast is good and normal. Overall you paid for the location and the price is fair for an old hotel although very very clean and well maintained. 
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Tried the Ramada Plaza for a Change I've been to Shanghai many times and have usually stayed at the Hyland Sofitel. That hotel recently raised its prices fairly dramatically with no apparent added benefits to guests - so, on this trip, I decided to stay at the Ramada Plaza (just up the road).Tried to book it through the Ramada website and couldn't - the reason being, as I found out, was that while it retained the &quot;Ramada&quot; branding, it had been sold to a Chinese company sometime ago and was no longer part of the Ramada chain.So I booked it through my travel agent at a slightly better price than the Sofitel.I arrived around noon. Check-in was extremely smooth and fast - after a long flight from Melbourne - that was a blessing. I'd booked, for 7 nights, a room with a double bed on a smoking floor. The bed was a pleasant surprise - king-size and, while being firm, was nowhere near the rock-hardness that characterise beds in most Asian hotels. I slept very well.All rooms are positioned around a central atrium which is quite pleasant as you enter or leave your room. Security is good as you must use your key-card in the elevator to go to your room - put the key into the slot and the elevator knows your floor and does the rest.The room, itself, was extremely clean, the bathroom standard for a 4-star hotel and, while quite comfortable and spacious, will need to be updated in 2-3 years' time if this hotel is to keep its star rating.A nice touch is the free wi-fi internet which worked well. The Sofitel (and many others) charge around $20 per 24 hours for internet access, so this made the margin in price between the Ramada and the Sofitel even greater.For english-speaking guests, the TV had limited channels - CNN, HBO National Geographic, CCTV9 and Channel News Asia. As with most hotels, they should, at least, have BBC World,Australia Network and Star Movies on their list. I didn't eat at the hotel - I seldom do in Shanghai. Breakfast was not included. There are SO many good, cheap eateries around the hotel area, why pay silly prices within the hotel itself??I had a problem with the in-room safe - the response from staff was prompt, courteous and, while the first person's english was limited, she quickly called up a senior person who arrived within minutes, spoke very passable english and solved the problem very quickly.I stayed in February 2009, so the air cond was turned off - that's standard in most hotels here at this time of year. However, after opening the windows, had no trouble sleeping, My room was on the 19th floor so I had no street noise to disturb me.The location: you really can't ask for better in Shanghai. You're right on Nanjing Road East pedestrian mall and a three minute walk from Peoples Square subway station which is a central hub of the subway system and will get you pretty much everywhere cheaply and quickly. SIgns, tickets machines and announcements in the trains themselves are also in english - so the system is easy to use - as well as being clean and efficient. For those places where the subway doesn't reach, use a taxi - they're still quite cheap here.Would I stay here again? After comparing rates at the Sofitel and the new Grand Central Hotel across the road, then, most likely, yes I would. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Rude Check in No Cold Aircon only heat. I checked into the hotel at 8pm after a long flight and long taxi ride. Taxi arrived bellboys did not help me with my luggage. Went up to the receptionist to get my room, there was nobody in front of me and she did not serve me until I asked if this was the front desk check in. Booked a king bed smoking room, but they said that they were out of kings and the only thing they had was a twin bed room. Then she had the gall to rudely tell me if I wanted it or not. Fine it was pre-paid so I took it, if it wasnt I would have walked right out due to her attitude. Asked for the assistant manager to come talk to me and he was just as rude as her. Go up to my room to find out that there was no internet connection besides wireless (my wireless adapter on my computer is broken) Call the assistant manager and he tells me to deal with it and that there was nothing they could do. even though the front desk told me there were rooms with wired connections. The room condition was appalling, the toilet had mold growing all over, the bed was rock hard, I ended up sleeping on the sigle seater sofa, which smelled bad. Finally the last straw was no cold airconditioning at night. Only heat... I called down and they said open the windows nothing they can do. Opened the windows to people screaming on the road. Paid for 2 days I left the first morning at 10 after 4 hours of sleep. Checked into the hotel next door which is great compared to that dump. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great Location Good Hotel The location is right on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Mall - which is both good and bad. You are right in the middle of things, but traffic can be very bad. It is walking distance to many things - and a short taxi ride to others.I stayed on the Executive floor (23rd) and had a nice large-ish room with large bathroom and jacuzzi. Water pressure in the shower was only average. Fresh fruit was delivered on arrival. The housekeeping staff were very attentive. The view was looking down Nanjing Road to The Bund, so very good! Access to the floor was by your room key into the slot in the elevator - no need to press the floor button - it does it for you.The Executive Lounge is on Level 25. Breakfast was included in the room price, but was only average at best - nothing to rave about.The doormen were always helpful with directions and flagging a taxi down, even during peak times it was only a short wait for a taxi.Overall I liked the hotel. Was not cheap, but was very convenient and a good hotel to stay in. It wasn't excellent, but was definitely above average. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Best value/location! I stayed here last year, on recommendation by Tripadvisor users. There were a few negative comments at the time, but it seemed to be the nicest vs. affordable hotel in a great tourist location for my last minute decision to check out the Bund. My expectations were average. This turned out to be a fantastic hotel, and I enjoyed every second of the stay. Check in was fast and simple, and in English; and they took care of my taxi request for departure immediately. I checked in at about 10pm, so I expected to get a &quot;leftovers&quot; room. To my surprise, I was upgraded to a suite. It was impeccably clean and comfortable with a great shower and decent view. After 2 weeks of Chinese food (which is my favorite, but..) I chose to have dinner at a little steak joint across the street. I had to take a rickety elevator to the second floor, so I was a little scared. The doors opened to a beautiful, quiet, Western-style steakhouse, where I had a delicious and affordable grilled steak with prawns and a glass of wine. I'm so happy I decided to stay at the Ramada Plaza. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Very good place We really enjoyed our stay in the Ramada. Our travel guides booked this hotel for us, and when we arrived we were pleased. The hotel lobby is welcoming and the concierge have maps and advice to hand out.Cabs were easy to come by from the front of the hotel and we had everything we needed during our stay.The room was clean, and everything worked well.If you want a &quot;no worries&quot; stay then book here and relax. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Best bet under $200 The Ramada was a bit hard to find the first day - but well worth the effort. (warning: I received multiple “map” locations from different sources which showed the WRONG location.) The Ramada is located next to the Royal Méridien, with the rear entrance to the lobby directly on Nanjing Rd (the pedestrian shopping boulevard). The location is exceptional!The lobby is very impressive with lots of marble and classic design. Shops, café, travel agency, airline office, bakery, business center, etc. in lobby. The buffet restaurant has an excellent selection of Asian, American and European foods. I really liked both the breakfast and dinner buffets (about 400CNY). There is also a classic Thai restaurant in the hotel. (there’s a Subway restaurant located on the outside of the hotel lobby)My room was amazing. Large, clean, well equipped - slippers, robes, mini-fridge, coffee, desk, sofa and chair, etc. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and glass shower area. The room had wireless internet and good signal strength (four bars). I booked a King Bed Superior Room for 900CNY (about $150USD) through the Ramada.com web site, and then got 10% discount for AARP or AAA. I arrived at the hotel at 9AM and they gave me a free upgrade to a King Bed Suite (1,170CNY)The Ramada is designed with the rooms around an open atrium, so each floor can see Roof to Lobby. The service and staff were excellent. Minor warning: I woke up to a persistent beeping noise (like someone text messaging on a phone in my room) which turned out to be the in-room safe had &quot;low&quot; batteries. When I contacted hotel service, they knew what was causing the sound and fixed it immediately.Overall, the Ramada was a great location - the lobby had a rear access to the tourist area and shopping district. The food and rooms and service were excellent. A GREAT value for under $200 (including free Wi-Fi!) "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Good Location in Shanghai We stayed in Ramada Plaza Shanghai for 2 nights. The hotel is not new since it was a local hotel before it was changed to Ramada Hotel. It is located in Nanjing Road East which is the pedestrian street of Shanghai. Nanjing Road East is were you can find local foods, stuff and products. It is one of the most most visited area in shanghai. The room rate is not bad considering shanghai is one of the most expensive cities in asia. There are other hotels located in different area in shanghai and choosing a hotel will depend on what you like. The french concessioner area is where you can find luxury items. The Pudong area is the business hub of Shanghai. The Nanjing East area is where you will find chinese local products. The size of the rooms in this hotel are bigger than newer hotels in shanghai. Many of the hotel staff knows how to speak english and are always ready to help you on your needs. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Worst Experience with staff at Beauty Salon and overall service I was very dissapointed with this hotel as a couple of things happened. First of all, after a long flight, I wanted to make a phone call to the beauty spa to enquire about the massage services. There were 2 different phone numbers in their phone directory, and both didn't work! I was firstly connected to the dim sum restaurant, and the 2nd number connected me to their housekeeping department. I called the reception to ask them to transfer me to their beauty spa...and it still connected me to the dim sum restaurant!!After lots of frustration, I went down myself and made appointment for a 45 min shiatsu massage costing RMB 200. The price was written down on the front desk menu very clearly in English. However, in the massage room, after approx 15 mins, I suspected that the massage therapist was not giving me a shiatsu massage. I asked her what massage she was doing....and after a few minutes, I found out that she was giving me a Massage costing RMB 480 and lasting 90 minutes!!! I asked her what the name of the massage was and she answered me &quot;test&quot;....I didnt even understand what she was talking about and I told her I actually wanted SHIATSU, she said she didn't know what that was, and also the hotel DID NOT offer this massage!!! I was so angry, because the Shiatsu massage was clearly written down in the front desk menu!!! I complained this to a guy who looked like he was a manager of the spa. He merely asked the lady to come out to the front desk and explain...and I could not even understand their chinese accent even when I speak mandarin fluently myself! He later used a very threatening tone and said to me: &quot; YOU SHOULD understand that these girls do not understand what Shiatsu is, and the Thai massage she gave you was similar anyway!&quot; Then I asked: &quot;why did the girl at the front desk tell her to give me 90 mins when I requested for only 45 mins.&quot; He replied: &quot;the girls at the front desk do not tell the massage therapist what the customers wants. YOU have to tell the massage lady what you want directly!!!&quot; I was soooo angry at what he said, but I did not want to make a huge scene just in case. I just paid and left. However, I just want to warn everyone that this is the worst service a hotel could ever offer as a 5-star rated hotel. TERRIBLE!!!! "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Excellent location If you want to see much that Shanghai has to offer, then this is the perfect location, close to People's Square. Ignore the hustlers on Nanjing Road and walk off into the side streets and work your way down to the Bund or go across to the Museum. My hotel room was very large and had everything I needed, - free and fast internet access, powerful shower, comfortable bed. Great views over the city too (especially as it was covered in snow). Negatives: the hotel lobby is soulless and I found the front desk staff a bit cold. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great location - easy access Booked flight hotel package with Cheaptickets over the Christmas holidays - very good price for a 5 day stay from the Westcoast. Location right on Nanking Road near People's Park was perfect. Easy access from the airport on the Maglev train to the Number 2 tram and the Nanking East station - best to get off here right on the pedestrian street than figure your way around all the People's Park interchange, even though on the map it looks closer. When you get out of the underground station, turn to your right and head up Nanking Road (you will see the spaceship Radisson Hotel on the horizon) and walk a few blocks to the hotel. There is no sign indicating it is the Ramada from Nanking Road pedestrian walk, so look for its distinctive roof line from the street and you will find it, it is right before the Meridian Hotel on your left as you walk towards People's Park.The biggest problems with this hotel was not honoring the &quot;free breakfasts&quot; promised by Cheaptickets. They would only honor one even though we made a double reservation. They charged $20 US for the second breakfast, while a nice buffet definitely not worth it. I had tried to confirm this with Cheaptickets ahead of time to insure they knew the offer included free breakfasts, and was assured by CT this was the case, but it was not. So don't make your decision about getting the free breakfast unless you are traveling solo. This was a disengenuous offer and I also fault Cheaptickets for their part in continuing this fraud as well.Also even though we upgraded to a studio room, which was very nice, there were no drawers in any of the cabinets. This was very awkward as all things had to lay on the floor of the cabinets where I was looking forward to unpacking once and having everything easily available for our 5 day stay. The room was lovely, quiet and even elegant so the lack of drawers was a bit of an oddity.But beyond those two glitches, the rest of the stay was wonderful to be in this location. Loved eating at South Beauty, did not care for Shanghai Uncle, and had an okay meal at the Meridian next door. Great dumpling and snack place right across the street and upstairs at Daniang Dumplings which is a sign near the Shanghai First Food Store across the street which has fried dumplings and really a treat to wander around and see the huge variety of every sort of Chinese food stuffs right on Nanking Road.Special places to visit close by of course are the Bund, the Pedestrial Tunnel to Pudong, People' Park, Shanghai Museum, and the Shanghai Development Exhibit all within a few blocks radius from the hotel.Don't be afraid to use the metro and best to get a card for multiple rides which you can purchase putting a certain amount on the card so you can use it until it is finished and not have to keep buying single tickets. They want a deposit for the card so you buy if for more than the value of the total rides, but it is so cheap don'teven worry about not turning it back in. I got two 50RMB cards ( total approx $20) and we did not use them all up in 4 days and just left them at the station when we were done, and ready to ride the Maglev back to the airport. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,Good Value for a Western Style Hotel Not a top flight international hotel but clearly better than an average Ramada in North America. The rooms and the lobby were quite good and the location was excellent. An easy and cheap (but exciting) cab ride from most of the key destinations.Reasonable value for what you got. One would easily pay this and more for a similar hotel in North America. I didn't eat in the hotel because I never find hotel restaurants to be worth the effort or the price. Lots of options around the hotel within easy walking distance. I would recommend this hotel. 
majesty plaza shanghai ,Can't do better This has it all. It is worthy of all its five stars. Rooms are good. Lobby is elegant. Location is tops. It is on the main shopping street and steps away from the metro where you can go 7 stops for 52 cents and connect with the world's fastest train that gets you to the Podong airport 30 km (19 miles) in eight minutes at 431km/hour (270mph) for USD6.50! 
majesty plaza shanghai ,Very convenient location reasonable service and good comfort We stayed in this hotel 2 nights in september 2007 and were very favourably impressed by the comfortable room and the excellent location next to the pedestrian zone with lots of activities until late in the night. Excellent breakfest and service.We can just recommand to anybody looking for a comfortable hotel in Shanghai. 
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Central location average hotel We have stayed for 3 nights in this hotel. Check-in and check-out was very good and fast. Breakfest was very good and we liked the style.Room service was okay and the room had average size and was clean and furniture was in good conditons.The pool was very nice and even big. Fitness centre was well equipped.Take care on your room safe as it runs with batteries. If the batteries are empty ... they can only be changed when the safe is open.Nanjing Road is not so nice, as there are many watch-bag-dvd-deales. You will not like it. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Bad check-in experience This hotel is very conveniently located, and the rooms are nice and comfortable. We had a bad checkin experience -- we had booked two rooms (for our family of 4) and requested one to have a king size bed and when we arrived none were available. They had other rooms with king size beds but would not give them to us because they were more expensive. A supervisor also could not remedy the situation. Overall our stay was not as comfortable as it should have been and this left a bad impression of the hotel service overall. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"horrible The lobby is nice,rooms are average.However the food, in particular breakfast , aside of having few choices, what was astonishing was finding a cockroach walking in the bread station. The staff was informed and the only action was to laugh among them, and later on advised us that the cockroach had been killed, no apologies or concern for the hygiene were shown.I will never stay here again!!! "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Laughable service I stayed here for a night on a business trip in April. First impressions were of a grand but rather tasteless foyer. Check-in was a disaster. I was told there was no reservation for me. I showed them confirmation code and reservation details on my PC. The front desk manager was unable to find any trace of it, and told me that if it had been booked through the internet by the agent, they might not have it. So even if you have a confirmation no., it does not mean you will get a room! The manager left after 15 mins to &quot;check with sales&quot;. Iw was another 15 mins before one of the hotel reception clerks took the initiative to allocate a room and issue me with a key regardless of reservation status. More shockingly, another guest walked in and sufered the same fate whilst I was waiting. I asked about a colleague who was scheduled to arrive later than me, and his reservation had been cancelled! My issue is that even if there is a serious hiccup, or a systemic problem, guests should not be kept waiting for half an hour (I timed it) at the front desk. Service in the main cafe/restaurant was also full of hiccups. I ate there for dinner as I had arrived late, and for lunch the next day as I had meetings in the hotel. I asked for a coffee after lunch, and was told it was not included in the price of the buffet lunch. I told them I would pay for it, but it still took ages to arrive. I also noticed that the food served at lunch and dinner was identical! Thankfully rooms in the hotel are more representative of this grade of hotel. The room was clean, furnishings are average, and everything worked OK. I do not intend to stay here again. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great Service!!Great Hotel! I've stayed in this hotel 3 times. Every time the rooms have been great, the breakfast is nice, the amenities in the rooms are wonderful, love the shower!, clean, friendly staff, etc. The last time my friend and I stayed we asked for several things from the staff and each request was met with courteous, speedy action. Very please. Also a great location. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Do not stay here you will be very sorry I booked my reservation for Ramada Plaza based on a recommendation. I do not know what the person was thinking who said to stay here--the service is atrocious, the maintenance is terrible, it is noisy, and very very expensive for what you get. Here's what I experienced: requested quiet, non-smoking room--got put in a smoking room next to hotel construction; bath towel was actually dirty (hair on it); air conditioning non-functional and maintenance unwilling to do anything to fix it; rooms have both noise from hotel and from street (even on 24th floor); workout room dismal and overheated; room sink was clogged up when I got in the room; asked concierage to book us tickets for Shanghai Circus World, instead he booked us at a 4th rate show in a run-down theater in a scary part of town at an extremely high rate; the maps they give out are outdated and missing huge chunks of the subway system and are not to scale in parts; no English spoken or understood for anything. Upon any of the issues above being explained to the desk (in English OR Chinese), there was no response or help. I would really like to save other visitors the extreme pain of wasting their money and time here (we had one night to see the circus and missed it because of the imcompentent concierage). Stay somewhere, anywhere else!! By the way, we stopped at the Radisson for help and the concierage was terrific, hotel is beautiful, staff is friendly (what a change!), location is very good, and I would try that in a heartbeat. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"If you do not need service o.k. This hotel is not a service-oriented one. Apparently owned by government most of the staff are students with not a lot of training and hardly any visable service-orientation and language skills. The hotel however is clean and the rooms also. We had a meeting there with customers and there were no complaints about bad rooms etc., but when it comes to service, the hotel makes a bad performance, especially in the banquette department. The servants could not speak and understand any English, there were 20 cups for 40 partcipants for coffee, the air condition did not work for 5 days although we complaint several times, the general managers was invisible and his staff just not responding. Near our meeting rooms was heavy construction going on and we had hardly any help from the staff to get our meeting going. It took a lot of effort to get what we wanted and this was nothing extraordinary. So if you just need a comfortable bed and nothing else, the hotel is o.k. , the breakfast buffet is fine, the restaurants are also o.k. The location is very good, you can reach most of the tourist attraction by foot. If you expect more service and friendly staff go to the Royal Meridien next door, here you find everything you want at a slightly higher price, however. Their bar there on the 66th floor is amazing. Drinks and food are excellant at European prices. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"You will enjoy This is a great hotel with a fantastic location for both business and tourism. Rooms are great, beds are firm but nice (I've had some bad experiences with rock hard beds) lobby and facilities are top class and you can't beat the location. You are right in the heart of the action quick walk east and your at the bund, shopping a plenty right out the front door and a quick walk west and your in Renmin square with all the arts, museums, gardens and hotels. Cabs are frequent along the road adjacent the hotel. Great value for tourists especially and the business centre really came in handy for me as I was running a seminar at the time "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"GREAT hotel Helpful staff, great location, walking distance to the Bund (Peace Hotel and M), right ON the major shopping pedestrian street Nanjing Donglu...theres a convenience store right across Nanjing st (so you can avoid the very overpriced minibar), a Pizza hut as well within feet of one entrance should you crave some western food...A subway within a couple of blocks, etc etc...Super-clean rooms with a flower in the bathroom, with all the HBO, CNN, etc. (and coffee packets in the room! A rarity in China!). Our friend's room on the 17th floor was pristine and beautiful, brand new, felt like a true 4 star, ours on the 19th was not as newly renovated and showed a little wear, but still excellent. Would definitely stay here again. Great place, our room even had somewhat of a view of the river and Pudong....at an amazing place when you factor in the price! "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Very nice hotel I spend 2 nights in this hotel at the beggining of December.It is a huge hotel at the center of the town, only a few meters from the main shopping street, Nanjing Road. The hotel is very clean, with all comforts and the price was great. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Sleepless at Ramada i just got back from China with my entire family of 16. It was my first trip to Shanghai together with my 12 year old daughter and we were booked at the 8th floor of the hotel which we were later told was the floor preferred by newly weds. The first night was a bit noisy because the newly weds were having games in the hallway! On our fourth night, the couple beside our room was quarelling quite violently. It was terrifying because it came to a point that they were banging the walls like they were going to come through it. Later, someone was banging our door and trying to open it. I had to call the assistant manager, front desk and concierge several times because the commotion would not stop. It was so so so terrible, horrible! They had to physically drag out the couple. When my daugter and I had finally got to doze off, someone knocks in our room at 12:38 am. Scared, I had to go to the door to find out who it was. It was a hotel staff asking if I requested a change. I was quite confused as to what change I wanted and at that time of the night! The following day, my sister-in-law wrote a letter of complaint to management and we personally submitted it. When we returned to check if we could talk to the manager, we were so shocked to see a torn letter held by the assistant manager! They probably did not want the complain to reach the general manager. There were no sincere apologies, just a cheap offering of 5 small cookies on a dinner plate with a bowl of fruits tied with a recycled ribbon! The hotel has great breakfast buffet and an excellent location! If they can polish their relationship with their guests, I do not mind going back and living there on my next vacation but as for now, I would consider other hotels where my family and I will feel secure! Peace of mind is, after all, one of the reasons for a vacation! "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Very good This Ramada is better than the ones I've used in America. Helpful, friendly staff, nice rooms and in a great location for exploring on foot or underground. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Nice Hotel / So-So Area HotelI was apprehensive about staying in a Ramada brand hotel because my experiences with them in the US have been totally poor. However, this Shanghai Ramada is genuinely a 4 star hotel with good service and English speaking concierge. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was friendly. There was security staff on the first floor at all times. It is 1 hour taxi ride (140 yuan) from Pudong International Airport.AreaThe area is on the pedestrian mall area of East Nanjing Road. Very unfortunately this is a major tourist area and touts are out in full force. You cannot take two steps without being stopped and offered bags, watches, or women. It is not an enjoyable place to stay. There is zero nightlife there. The more up upscale area on West Nanjing Road near Portman Center and Shanghai Hilton hotel is a much better place to stay. There is better dining, nightclubs, bars there and less beggars and touts.Nearby Dining/ShoppingCabs are cheap so every shop and restaurant is in reach. Good spicy food with good service is at Meilongzhen Restaurant. We dined at Shanghai Uncle at the Westin Hotel but the food and service was terrible. If you plan to visit YuYuan Garden you should eat at Shànghai Lao Fàndiàn (Old Shanghai Restaurant) and a visit to Shanghai would not be complete without experiencing the wonderful view/food from the balcony at M on the Bund. We went to KaDe Club video shop and loaded up on DVDs for cheap though there authenticity is questionable. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Hotel Nice - Major Check in problems I recently booked three rooms at the Ramada Plaza Shanghai with the Ramada Reservation desk. While making the reservation, I was informed that the hotel had a special package which included free laundry, free in room broadband service and a free buffet breakfast. This package was $10 USD more than the rate posted on the internet. I went ahead and booked this package.At check in, the hotel refused to honor the package. They said that they did not participate in the package and that they had informed Ramada International. They would upgrade the room, but would not include any of the items noted in the package that I had booked. After going through three levels of management, they eventually agreed to provide the breakfast and broadband access from the business center. The hotel itself was very nice. The two room suite was nicely decorated and quite comfortable. There was a bit of noise from outside, but that was to be expected due to the location of the hotel.The hotel is located on a busy tourist street (Nanjing Lu). The Bund area and the Huangpu River is approximately a fifteen minute walk. In the opposite direction, one can reach the museum area as well as the metro in approximately 5-10 minutes.The service level was somewhat disappointing as compared to the other hotels we stayed in throughout China. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great stay Location: excellent, right in the centre of where you want to be in ShanghaiRooms: spacious, well equipped, very cleanStaff: very helpful and friendlyRestaurant: the breakfast was disappointing, but okValue: its somewhat expensive (staying on the Club floor is NOT worth it)Recommend staying at this hotel "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great Staff and Location My family rented two rooms for 4 days at the end of June 2006. The location was excellent, right on Naijing pedestrian mall with lots of new shops, restaurants and new building. The Bund is a 15 minute walk to the river and sights of the spectacular Pudong skyline.The hotel was 4 star was the usual modern and western amenities. Several restaurants and a upper floor executive lobby overlooking the city.The front staff was very helpful and spoke English. I want to compliment an excellent concierge names Mr. William Shen, who helped us way beyond the call of duty. He accompanied us to a nearby dim sum restaurant to help us orders from a Chinese language only menu - kudos to Mr. Shen.On the down side, internet access was expensive and health club charges were very deceptive. The hotel manager tried to intervene but told me the club is run separately from Ramada. Although the fitness equipment, pool, showers, spa were excellent, there are no indications that using the sauna was an extra charge (the spa next to it was free for guest). There are many English language signs at the front desk of the health club with charges, but nothing that said the sauna was extra $10 dollars per person. Also my son and I was forced to buy a $12 swimming cap for the pool because those were the written rules. But to our surprise, many people using the pool had no swim cap! So, don't let the nice lady at the front cheat the &quot; rich Americans&quot;.That was the only unpleasant experience of our trip. Caution: China is still a very poor country and there many beggars and shady character out after 10 pm on the Mall and elsewhere outdoors. You will be swarmed if they know you are a tourist. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Great Location and Great services I stayed at Ramada Plaza Shanghai in May of 2004 for 5 nights for vacation. Check in was a breeze. The receptionist of the front desk was very friendly. I was upgraded to a suite as soon as he discovered that the type of room my travel agent booked for me was not available. My room was specious with a small living area though it was a little dark with only one small window. The bath room was fantastic with a large Jacuzzi. It was built with all marbles. House keeping was excellent. My room was always cleaned in a pefect manner. The location of this hotel certainly is the best for a leisure traveler. It is within walking distance to most attractions, such as the Bund, Nanjing Road, Legendary Peace Hotel, People’s squares, etc… There are plenty good and cheap eats as well as many large department stores and smaller shops around the neighborhoods. My breakfast was included in the room rate. Food was good, service staff was pleasant. However, all the guests had to find an available table ourselves. The restaurant was so packed with large tour groups during the breakfast time (7am to 10am). It was a bit struggle to find a table every morning. I had to share my table with strangers a few times. One thing you need to be aware. This hotel has two entrances. One entrance is on JiuJang Road, the other one is on East Nanjing Road. This could be the only hotel in Shanghai that has two addresses. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay. It is good value for money. I would definitely stay there again. "
majesty plaza shanghai ,"Ramada Plaza a good experience overall! A very well location hotel in a very busy and hectic city.The hotel is located on the main shopping street of Shanghai and is well located for walking to any of the major tourist sights and also the very good underground system.The hotel facilities are very good and the staff are both efficient and friendly. The breakfast and the restaurant food is fairly typical of your average hotel and is nothing to write home about. The accomodation, particularly the suite accomodation that we had on our trip, was spacious, clean and well equipped. Overall I was pleased enough with the hotel and would not discount using it again, however I would probably look to see what else was available in the same price range. "

manhattan business hotel ,"Simple hotel - Good location We travelled for a quick business trip to Shanghai and stayed at this hotel because of its location. It is located in the Bund, walking distance away (6 or 7 blocks) from Nanjing road (the main shopping avenue).The hotel is very clean. The room was small but had a 42'' plasma (with Chinese TV only) and a computer on the room with free internet. The window could not be open. The bathroom was small but OK.This hotel is ideal for leisure travellers with little time to waste on taxis or subways (Shanghai's traffic can be really messy). I would not reccommended it for long stays or business trips.Mrs Zhang in the front desk was very helpful and friendly and speaks really good English (which is not easy to find in many Chinese places).Bottom line, it's a 3 star hotel, nothing fancy about it, and you get exactly what you are paying for. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Room was great staff were rude and incompetant If you are looking for just a room and don't need any help from the hotel, then this hotel would be perfect. The room was clean and comfortable (after travelling throughout Asia, the bed was a welcome change from usual hard pads). There were no windows in my room, which may not be ideal for couples, so I would suggest inquiring beforehand. I used the laundry service and I was quite pleased with the results. I wouldn't suggest the breakfast they serve. It's a cheap buffet, but they have tastier options outside. The location was nice, being situated right next to the bund and walking distance to the nearest subway station and mall. The wireless internet wasn't working properly for the duration of my stay.This was the last extension of my trip, so I needed some help from the front desk for things. 1) I needed to make an international call. It didn't work. I was told to confirm the number and dial 011 first. I went back to my room and tried again but couldn't get it to work. I went back downstairs and waited in line again to be served. They then made a call to someone and told them to activate my phone. So I went upstairs and tried again. Didn't work. Then I went downstairs and waited in line again. I asked them to confirm what I have to dial to get out of China, and they told me 0011. So I went back and tried it, but it still didn't work. Long story short, I waited in line 5 times just to find out that the numbers they were giving me were wrong and they didn't bother to activate my phone first.2) I needed help booking a day side trip. I asked them if they provide the service. The woman looked like this was a huge inconvenience and said I should go there myself to book it. I told her I didn't speak Mandarin and thought I needed some help. She assured me that they would speak English there. I also told her that I wanted to book it all in advance so that I would get a seat, but I didn't want to spend a day journeying to the ferry port just to book and come back again later. She assured me that if I went the day of when I wanted to go, I would get a seat. I asked her if she was sure, and she assured me I would be fine. Sure enough, I make the journey there and not only was the day trip that I wanted booked solid for the next two days, but all the other ones as well. Wasted an entire day and never got to do the side trip.3) Wanted to exchange money, was told to come to the desk whenever I wanted. I came at 5pm and was told the exchange desk is only open from 9 to 4pm. I was seriously low on yuan and had to spend the night in the hotel because of it. 4) Asked for a map, was told that it would cost me money. I showed them a rather simplified map that I had and asked them to point something out on it, and they told me that just pointing out the spot would also cost me money. So I guess the room charge is exactly that, a room charge only. Don't expect any help from the staff. "
manhattan business hotel ,"You get what you pay for! This hotel is in a good location but its quite odd. The rooms are really tiny and uncomfortable and some of the staff are unhelpful, but for the location its good value for money and I think you would struggle to find a better hotel for the price in a location so central.We only stayed for four nights and it was okay. It did the job and served its purpose. We were happy to move on though. Four nights was definitely enough for us. "
manhattan business hotel ,"A Dump Based on tripadvisor reviews i booked a roomin this hotelwith a window. turns out window here means a fixed opaque glass pane. therefore no ventilation. with august temps rising above 30 degree celsisus, the hotel regularly switches of the central off or has a faulty AC system meaning around 3 a.m. you may wake up sweating and feeling suffocated and the fixwd glass 'window' can't be opened. they do nothing about it and the reception don't speak much english. room lighting is so bad that you feel you are in adungeon somewhere. everything feels damp and clammy. breakfast and bar/restaurant is overpriced. everything around resembles a huge construction site especially the bund. there are no location advantges by staying here as taxis are cheap and with so much construction, you can't really walk anywhere on the bund. go somewhere else unless you want to experience the black hole of calcutta "
manhattan business hotel ,"Great location Great staff humid rooms Stayed at this hotel from the 14-22nd of July for business. had booked a room through agoda and got a good price for the basic room. From Pudong airport, i took the maglev to longyang rd. then the metro line 2 to Nanjin rd. east (cost 50+4 rmb) in total. The hotel is located a 10 minute walk from the metro station. Perfect location for access to the city in my view. two mini markets are located 1 minute away, and you can choose among a japanese/chinese, plus two chinese local restaurants within 2 minutes walking.RoomsFrom the other reviews of this hotel, I was prepared for the small room size, so this was no problem when i saw that this was actually very true. Unfortunately I was disturbed the first night, by the aircon, which is directly above the head of the bed. Even while off, there was a strong draft sound, throughout the night from the airvent, which made me ask for a new room the following day. I got a new room with no problem, that was a bit bigger, and here the sound from the airvent was a little less disturbing.. Only real criticism I have of both the rooms is that the humidity in the room, felt very high, through the 7 days I stayed here. Even though the hygrometre showed about 55-65, my clothes in the suitcase was cold and wet, even though I had not unpacked it. Same thing goes for the bed and linning. I have a theory about the hotel in general is using a bad centralized airconditioning system for the rooms. Staff and other servicesThe staff present during my stay was very friendly and treated me well. English knowledge is okay for basic inquiries. I never used the restaurant or any other services the hotel offered, except from the FREE wireles internet, which was a great thing. Only the wireless connection is free, LAN costs 30 rmb a day. The hotel in general is nicely decorated and has dimmed light.PS. If you do not already have a plan for your visit, I recommend getting a personal guide. I can personally recommend Aron, who has helped me: shanghailocalguide.com. Another tip is to make a survival list with the 10-15 most basic Chinese words and sentences and take it with you every where. Best regards C.B.Pedersen "
manhattan business hotel ,"Past its prime You can tell this used to be a grand hotel. Not anymore..When we first checked in we got to our room, a tiny cot with no window, even though we booked with window. As the error was corrected we got to a slightly larger, as dated and dirty room. Extremely hot, dirty bathroom and dated interior.On the plus side, the location is pretty good, and I guess it is hard to find a hotel this cheap as central as it is. If you can handle bug bites, then go for it! "
manhattan business hotel ,"Decent but could have been better The hotel is reasonably well situated, but since I was on vacation I would have preferred being rather in French Concession area. Nanjing road is just too stressful with so many aggressive sales men during day and hookers during night. I stayed for two weeks, so I got to know the surrounding place very well. There were no cafes or bars anywhere nearby. You had to walk at least 15 minutes to find the nearest Starbucks. Subway station wasn't too far. Beds were hard. Room was decent, but small with no windows. I had the most basic kind of room. So although, it's a decent deal for the price, I would have rather paid extra 10-20 euros and gone to a better hotel. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Great value great location clean and friendly staff Really nice hotel in a great location, near the subway, and the main sites. The staff are really friendly, the room was a good size, and had good facilities. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was a nice but great value hotel. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Good for business travel and GREAT LOCATION Good overall hotel, and very clean. Excellent location, walking distance to the Bund, Nanjing Lu, metro station, and to plenty of cabs. Art Deco decor. Not overly content with the service, small room with no window, small wardrobe, small bathroom. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Comfortable Rooms in an Ideal Location At first the hotel was a bit hard to find as there was extensive renovations going on in the area, no fault of the hotel. It is on Dianchi Road behind the Peace Hotel which is right on the Bund. To get there we took the Maglev from Pudong Airport and then took the Metro line 2 from Longyang Station to East Nanjing Road Exit 3. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from there in the direction of the Bund just ask someone in the area for directions.The room was small but very comfortable, it was clean; there was a kettle, coffee, tea hair dryer and free internet. It is reasonably priced given the location, do keep in mind it’s a business hotel. Again the Bund is just a 2 minute walk around the corner and the famous shopping street Nanjing Road is a 5 minute walk away. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Comfortable rooms and great location I usually pick hotels based on location first. This hotel is suited perfectly as it is right next to the Bund and a short walk to the metro. The only thing I ask in a hotel room is to provide me with a comfortable base to return to, since most of the time I will be out sightseeing. The Manhattan Business Hotel provides exactly that.I booked a Common Room. It's a very small room with the king size bed taking up most of the room. There are no windows, which didn't really bother me. The only thing is that you can't tell if it's morning or night except by looking at the clock. They put plenty of mirrors which give the illusion of more space and also helps with the lighting. The room is a little dark. I could have used brighter, white lights.The bathroom is small, but clean and has new fixtures. It is hidden behind a sliding mirror door. You only get a shower stall and not a tub, but I only take showers. The towers are new and soft! I can't tell you how many times I've gotten worn out scratchy towels at hotels.There is also a small armoire to hang your jacket or pants, and there is a small safe inside. There is also a small desk and a wall mounted LCD tv (it was a 26&quot; tv I believe). I usually only watch CCTV-9, the English language international channel when I'm in China, so I don't miss HBO or other American channels. I wish they had managed to fit in a small refrigerator though. Not that crucial as there is a Family Mart a block away.Wi-fi worked perfectly for my netbook. They had two connection points on the fifth floor, and either one worked great. The signal was good (3 out of 5 bars for me).For around $45 a night, this room was perfect for me. If you traveling with another person or family, I'd definitely get a bigger room, but I would definitely book this hotel again. You can't beat the location and value. "
manhattan business hotel ,"FANTASTIC I travel extensively for business and pleasure. This hotel's room gave me much pleasure and relaxation. The room quality, size, offerings far exceed the cost. In fact the Executive Suite with the amazing Jacuzzi tub and outrageous huge shower, fantastic size room with so much room to &quot;hang&quot; out and relax in made me feel like a very rich celebrity but on a realistic budget. Location was great. Shopped and was able to enjoy the &quot;bund&quot; even though I only had one night to do it in. Loved it so much am going back next week for this next business trip. Very unusual as I enjoy staying in different hotels everytime. This hotel offers an incredible amount for the price. Service was fantastic. "
manhattan business hotel ,"No Window Good location near the Bund area. 5 min walk to enjoy the spectacular view. go at night prefer on weekend, when they light up all the building. Great. Staff is friendly, with a Spa on the ground floor, the services is quite pricey thou. You could get less expensive spa else where. The room is extremely small with a big plasma TV, so it quite difficult to enjoy the TV and it got NO WINDOW. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Superb Hotel with a great location in Shanghai I stayed at the executive suite for six nights and found the hotel just great!! Very friendly and professionell staff with a superb location just off The Bund. My suite, which I got for about 90 dollars, was really worth the money. You had to walk for 30 seconds to reach The Bund and one minute to reach Nanjing Road East. The Hotel was really really clean. The bed was pretty hard which is always get case in China! Recommended!! "
manhattan business hotel ,"Good location comfortable yet daggy hotel I stayed at the Manhattan Bund Business Hotel for a couple of nights in February 2009. None of the maps I viewed prior to booking gave an accurate indication as to its location - so FYI it is located behind/next to the Peace Hotel (North). Dianchi Rd runs parallel to Nanjing Rd for one block between Zhongshan Rd (The Bund) and Sichuan Rd. And the hotel is about a 5min walk to either the Bund or Nanjing Rd. And about a 10min walk to the nearest subway station.None of the reception staff spoke much English, but enough to get by (barely). My room was an Executive Suite, and it was HUGE!!! with lounge/receiving area, work area/desk (and computer) and king sized bed &amp; 42&quot; LCD. The rooms however were very daggy, and it looked like they were styled in the 1970s. The bathroom was big, and included a spa bath, and an awesome multijet shower. High speed internet was available via a wired connection (and computer) in to room for 10yuan for 24hrs access, or free via wi-fi - however the only place in the room I could get a strong signal was on the floor just inside the door (not very convenient, considering how big the room was). Contrary to other reviews, the rooms do have windows; you just can't see out of them as they are frosted glass - not that there is a view anyway. The buffet breakfast was extremely good value for 48yuan. I never had dinner at the restaurant as there was a multitude of places to eat nearby. Drinks in the in room fridge were also quiet cheap for a hotel, yet still not as cheap as at the mini mart at the end of the street.The only things I didn't like about the hotel were:- The only tourist maps they had of the area were in Chinese - No English maps at all.- The lack of decent wifi signal in the room.- Communication with the reception staff was difficult as they had little English skills. Even asking what the days weather was to be got to be a chore.All in all, for the price I paid for the Executive Suite (~AU$150/nt) I got a very good deal, and if I ever go back to Shanghai, I would strongly consider staying here again . "
manhattan business hotel ,"Better than 3 star hotel I would say this is another good hotel to stay, it is about 5 min walk to the metro station, the station is in 1 plaza exit at no. 3 if you fly to Pudong airport you can get out by maglev train (40 yuan) then get the metro at Longyang station metro line 2 (green line) then go to East Nanjing station 4 yuan get out at gate no. 3 then walk down to the Bund ....might be a little difficult to find the hotel so i just ask the people around there. There is a family mart near the hotel, and some place to eat breakfast and dinner. This hotel is near the Bund which travelers must go to see and take picture here with the Orient tower. When we got into the hotel, the room is small but they put lots of mirror in the room so it's look bigger, in the room every equipment is there, kettle, coffee, hair dryer, a big LCD tv. The bahtroom is very small no tub but it's clean and it's ok if you just want to take a shower. The room is clean and bed is ok ....blanket should be more thicker and also there is only 1 pillow for each people and it's very flat. If you didnt stay in the room much you will not be complaint about the tv channel which there is HBO and CNN only for you to watch and the rest is Chinese channel. Anyway this hotel is cheap try to book by agoda website. I will say this hotel is almost 4 star hotel. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Good hotel has its quirks I stayed at the Manhattan Bund Business Hotel for a couple of nights. I got to the hotel late, due to a late flight - I checked in at 2am, but had called before to let them know, so it was all fine. The reception staff are efficient, although not all of them know English - one day, I talked to a very fluent guy and a very fluent lady who gave me information. The next day, the receptionists did not know English and had to resort to calling the English-language Guanxi telephone line to resolve my query (I was asking for directions).The rooms are small and have 1970s decor, which is charming in its own way. The bathrooms are ok, but are a bit small in size. There is an in-room safe and net connection (wifi and wired). The service was good - I left the room in the afternoon on the weekend, and it was cleaned before I got back. When they figured out I was a foreigner, they left an English-language paper, which was considerate.The room had free net connection via an in-room computer, and several high-speed wifi which I connected to with my laptop. These were very good. My gripes about the room were:1. No fridge2. The bedsheets had a tear in them on the second night3. The underside of the sink tap was encrusted with I don't know what....obviously not cleaned too well4. No desk....in a business hotel, how are you supposed to do work with no desk?The bar and restaurant was empty throughout my stay. However, it has atmosphere, due to the 1970s feel, and the barman and bar-lady are friendly and really helpful. Beer is 25 Yuan a bottle, which is expensive for China, but not that expensive for hotels in China. I didn't try the food here, as it was expensive and anyway there are lots of places around the hotel to have food. I didn't try the massage and sauna as I heard that these are kinda expensive. A business centre would also be helpful....The location was good - a minute from Nanjing Road, 5 minutes from Nanjing Road East metro (line 2), and a minute from the Bund. The area is very safe, even very late at night. Yes it is dark, but I didn't see anyone dodgy around here. And it's easy to catch taxis from outside the hotel, as there is always one (or two) waiting. There is also a small supermarket, and a Family Mart, on the corner near the hotel, for essentials such as toothpaste, bottled water, snacks and baozi (although the baozi I saw were kinda old!). "
manhattan business hotel ,"Good deal. Good location. Little old! I saw the reviews from Trip Advisor so booked it through Expedia. The location is great - only one block over from the famous Nanjing Road, the Bund, and plenty of shopping! The only downside is the again the location as it's off the main road, so the evenings can be a little dark walking back to the hotel. At night, it's definitely a little scary but if you with someone else (ie. spouse) should be OK. There's enough people out at all times of the day that it's not bad.The restaurant on top (8th floor) could be better. There's no free breakfast with the stay which is very disappointing. Prices are alright by Canadian standards but pricey for China.The room is very small. Be enough for two at most! There's no minibar fridge so we couldn't have cold drinks when we wanted, which was often during these summer hot days!OVerall I was ok with the stay but would look for something on the main road next time but you can't beat the price! "
manhattan business hotel ,"Good location small basic rooms Although close to the Bund &amp; Nanjing Road, you will want to upgrade/book a large room if staying here for more than one night and want a level of comfort. As per other reviews, the basic rooms are TINY. Our 1st room, the size of a walk-in closet, had a tiny non-operable shaded window &amp; the decor, while “Asian exotic&quot; with dark colors was a bit dark and depressing. As we and our bags barely fit in the room, we paid several hundred USD more (for a week stay) to upgrade to a larger room -so much for a budget hotel. The larger room had lighter décor and a large operable window, a King-size bed, mini fridge, hot pot, desktop computer, large flat screen TV &amp; small shower (no bath) within a very tiny bathroom. The carpet, dirty and stained, was not vacuumed during our stay. Housekeeping was very inconsistent in terms of cleaning the floor, counters, replenishing water, &amp; providing a newspaper, etc. Laundry service was good &amp; reliable. Despite its name, by no means is this a business hotel; no clock in the room, no on-site business center, wireless internet rates are confusing and convoluted, and printing docs at the front desk is quite a task. The desk staff speak VERY little English. The hotel restaurant on the top floor was always empty, as well as a bit dark and dismal, but ok for a quiet drink. Great location if you want to be close to the Bund (near the entrance to the Psychedelic tunnel) but next time we will stay closer to the Sofitel area in the Nanjing or French Concession area. "
manhattan business hotel ,"Nice hotel great location I've been staying on business in Shanghai on and off for a couple of months now, and have had an incredible amount of trouble finding a hotel that (a) wasn't going to rip me off and (b) had service approaching the usual international standard. I tried the Manhattan Business Hotel on the Bund (historic riverside area of Shanghai) on the strength of a Japanese guidebook review.Turned out pretty well. It's just off the Bund main drag, just off Nanjing Lu (the main commercial thoroughfare of Shanghai) and two minutes walk from the underground/subway. Historic looking building, friendly front of house staff, and I got a suite for 777RMB ($100).Broadband in the room, nice shower, lots of free mineral water.Breakfast was good - freshly made real coffee, orange juice (as opposed to orange squash served in the last 4* hotel I stayed at in Shanghai), and nice service (a waiter spotted I wanted some toast, and made it for me in the buffet toaster- without a word of request from me).Only one downside is that for some strange design reason, none of the rooms have clear windows - all frosted glass or no windows. And they don't open. Weird.It doesn't have a swimming pool, exercise room or Michelin starred restaurant. But if you want a reasonably priced centrally located hotel with friendly staff, I'd recommend it strongly. "

mansion hotel ,"Fantastic in every possible way!! We have just come back from a 6 day stay in this beautiful hotel. Do not believe the negative, picky comments made by others, they are just not true. The hotel was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Shanghai, and has had dinner and drinks on the rooftop terrace so she knew the location and the public interiors.As a first timer to Shanghai this was the perfect location. Set in the French Concession in a street full of small boutiques, but far enough away from the noise to not disturb you. The rooms were beautiful, but most importantly the service, was excellent. They don't fawn over you, so travellers who are expecting this should stay away. They are polite and helpful when needed. The front desk staff had excellent English, and we made the effort to learn enough Mandarin to converse simply with the restaurant and housekeeping staff. We had way less problem understanding and being understood then we did at a multi-national hotel in Dallas which employed Mexican staff. "
mansion hotel ,"I wish I lived here My boyfriend and I were very taken with the pictures we saw of this hotel and as we are not keen on staying in homogenous business hotels, we decided to splash out for a couple of days, whilst travelling around China. I am really surprised by the negative reviews on this site. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful, for example they booked sleeper tickets for us, saving us a trip to the train station and did not charge us a commission. I had my incredibly heavy rucksack carried up to the room and there was no expectation of a tip. As for the room... It was without doubt, the most luxurious room either of us has ever stayed in. The bed alone was so big it required a step up to it (as did the two person bath tub). The furniture (which is repro - who would put genuine antiques into a hotel room?!) worked really well to give a 1930s vibe. Maybe the large flatscreen tv didn't fit in with the decor but it was easy to ignore. The bathroom was also impressive. Apart from the two-person tub, there was a large shower cubicle with the best shower I've ever had - three settngs: main shower, mini shower and spray/mist. And the toiletries were delicously scented!We also had access to a balcony that overlooked the front of building, so we had a great view of the comings and goings of the street as well as a great view of the Russian Church opposite. The only real noise came from the crickets (presumably in the trees) but they stopped at night :)Breakfast was also fine - a choice of a main meal, tea/coffee and then buffett (fruit, cheese, bread etc). The only real downside to the hotel was the cost of room service and mini bar (8 yuan for 1 litre of Evian...)Overall, this was an amazing hotel! "
mansion hotel ,"Perfect Stay for Our Small Group I organized a group of 8 to stay at the Mansion for the July 22, 2009 Total Solar Eclipse. Group members universally loved the Mansion. The accomodations exceeded expectations (even better than as pictured on the Hotel webiste). The service, both before and during the stay, was superlative. We chose the mansion because we wanted an historic &quot;boutque&quot; hotel with a panoramic view. The Mansion fit the bill perfectly. They set up a rooftop oasis for us for viewing the eclipse; and fortunately, it was covered by an awning (it rained during the event).I do not understand some of the negative reviews I posted here previously. I have stayed at dozens of small luxury properties on five continents, and I cannot recall better service or accomodations for the money. "
mansion hotel ,"Great experience at the Mansion Just came back from a trip to China, Thailand, Laos and Hanoi.Trip was wonderfulIn Shanghai we stayed at a wonderful placed callled the Mansions, in the French Concession.The manager and assistant manager could not have been nicer. We found a price on Hotels.com and then emailed the hotel directly. SInce I was traveling with a friend, of the same sex, we wanted 2 beds in the larger room.The manager was happy to move the beds, match the price of Hotels.com, and threw in a free breakfast.When we arrived in Shanghai, after out flight had been significantly delayed, the car that the hotel had arranged to meet us, was not there. The hotel had called and been given incorrect information from the airlines.They were VERY apologetic, and gave us an additional breakfast , on them, as well as 2 free drinks.The staff was extremely helpful with the many questions we bothered them with daily.. As well as excellent with suggestions . They went out of there way to make our stay at the hotel great.The hotel itself, is quite charming.When we first walked in to the lobby, we were a bit put off..l But, within seconds were thrilled that we had decided to stay there.My understanding is that there is a great deal of histroy connected with the hotel, including being owned , at one time, by an opium drug lord..Location is great..in the French Concession, Great area to walk in, and convienient to everything. Taxis were plentiful, and the staff was always helpful about locating one.I highly recommend this hotel, and look forward to staying there again, soon "
mansion hotel ,"Great Location Compensate for Rude Incompetent Untrained Staff Positives: Location in the French Concession on a quiet street near trendy cafes, boutiques, spas, and a short walk to major shopping areas is outstanding. The cool-factor of being in an old mansion is fun.Service:Horrible for this price range (any price range for that matter) for the following reasons. - Staff at the main entrance failed to greet us with a simple &quot;Hello&quot; 75%, preferring to text message or look askance. - Check out: (1) No offer to help us with luggage or to hail a taxi even though staff were standing in the lobby quite aware of both our presence and of our checking out. (2) Cashier was incompetent. The bill was settled in cash. The employee was unable to count the bills by hand, preferring to use an automatic counter which jammed 10 times before she gave up and tried to count the bills. She was not confident and just let me go as I was clearly exasperated by her inability to simply cound 35-odd bills.- Clogged sink: had to inform staff twice (I speak Chinese, so no communication difficulties) to have the simple problem fixed. Five hours lapsed between requests.- Maid service: (1) did not refill complementary fruit tray over our multi-day stay. (2) allowed the hotel's internet cable to remain strewn about the floor/table, not even attempting a cursory tidying up of it. - Size: room was much smaller and equipped with a small bathroom and no tub as against the pictures they advertise.Conclusion: The period details make the location interesting; however, the lack of modern amenities such as a gym or comfortable lounge or larger rooms do not make this establishment worthy of a multi-night stay. Spend one night to have the experience, then move to the Regent. The hotel's one saving grace is its location. "
mansion hotel ,"A Hotel with Integrity Business travel is usually uncomfortable. Most 5 star hotels are exactly the same, and hence boring. What a pleasure then to stay at a hotel which satisfies the key attribute missing in most hotels .... being made to feel special. There is nothing pretentious about China Mansion. It's the genuine article. "
mansion hotel ,"Old Shanghai repackaged This is boutique hotel at its best. Charming and intriguing at the same time. You feel like you are staying at the clubhouse of THE Mafia boss of 1930s Shanghai.The location is extremely convenient, 2 mins to HuaiHai Road, a major shopping location and at the edge of the quaint french concession area.The room exceeded our expectations. Looks old on the photos but is extremely comfortable. Fluffy beds, clean sheets of a sufficient thread counts and your own pair of embroidered slippers for that old Shanghai feel. The toilet ticks all our boxes as female guests. Huge bath, rainshower high pressure steam room. Large sink, mirrors and quaint antique jewelry boxes for your toiletries. Service is attentive in general and the staff try very hard to speak and understand english. The carpet is a dream to walk on and the armchairs are so delicious, they are hard to get out of.On the downside, if you want to nitpick...they should have repaired the carpets at areas with more wear and tear instead of throwing a thick layer of plastic over it. We could do with better toiletries and bath oil etc. But who uses hotel toiletries anyways...Turndown service could do better than 2 measly piece of DOVE candy. The LCD is really in your face and clashes with the old world glamourFantastic on the whole and a breath of fresh air in accommodations. Definitely worth a stay if you are allergic to the hotel chains like we are. "
mansion hotel ,"Good but NOT Great. Ok Let's cut to the chase here.Pro's1) Location. Location. Location. 2 blocks away from all the upscale shopping and restaurants.2) Colonial building with a fascinating history. Great Lobby.3) Rm Decor 4) Terrace Restaurant (go for a drink. not food).Con's (some of them only apply b/c the hotel claims to be a 5 star)1) Cigar smoke permeates the ENTIRE hotel at night.2) Sorry Breakast3) Staff are not as service oriented as you would expect in this hotel catagory. Front desk could be clueless sometimes. Don't expect any greetings/smiles/help from doormen/lady. Seems like &quot;standing by the door&quot; is their entire job description, and they do exactly so.4) Very short driveway. You end up at a streetcorner if you want a cab.5) Rm showing it's age even with the 2007renovation. For example, a few small moldy spots between the tiles in the bathroom. Also. for a short person like me, getting into the tub required a stepping stool (provided). Not sure how it would go for elderly or children. In short, having stayed at Ritz/JW in Shanghai before, this is by no means a true 5 star experience. But it you want something unique, woldn't hurt to give it a shot. "
mansion hotel ,Wedding at Marvellous Mansion Our wedding couldn't have been any more perfect at the Mansion.Right from the start until the end we were looked after like Royalty. They gave a massive room that was beautifully decorated with petals in the big Jacuzzi and even a rose in the toilet bowl. We had the ceremony at the top of the hotel and Shanghai turned on a great day me and my husband. We danced the night away and everyone had a fantastic time. My family and I will recommend this hotel to all of our friends and if you ever want a romantic getaway Mansion hotel is the place to do it. The staff are so sweet and attended to our every need. The hotel itself is fascinating and is a great place to escape the busy center of Shanghai. 
mansion hotel ,"Disaster!! Our 4 day stay in Oct. 2008, was a disaster; This is far from a five star hotel; the standard and deluxe rooms have littleto no space for clothing; the food is terrible; eg. a $45.00 &quot;Kobe&quot;steak in the roof terrace arrived cold and inedible; We were double charged for a 1/2 day tour; and although this wasrecognized by the staff, the charge remained; there is considerable traffic noise..Few of the reception desk staff speak any EnglishThis hotel is highly over rated and over priced. "
mansion hotel ,"Lovely Stay But... I had visited Shanghai in June and wanted to take a look at the China Mansion for my next trip in September. It was really difficult finding a taxi driver who knew where it was but after about 5 attempts we made it. The hotel lobby is certainly stunning and staff were most accommodating, offering us a tour of the rooms. It is absolutely lovely - as close to 1930s Shanghai as you can get. Lots of antiques, some opulent rooms and of course the &quot;gangster history &quot; is quite different to the usual big chains. So fast forward to September when I booked 3 rooms for a business trip. On arrival staff were very helpful and we were delighted to be upgraded - my room was a balcony room and I loved it. But here goes the good things and a few not so good. Hotel beautiful, atmospheric and in a nice area for walking the French concession. Staff try their best to help. As a five star hotel though - on checking in I had dried urine from a previous guest on the toilet seat. That's not good even for a budget hotel. Next (I'm being picky here) the robes were tatty and the pockets torn, the fruit in the room looked pretty old and wasn't changed for the 4 nights I was there. Staff were sometimes slow -especially with drinks and the maids were often pushy. Even though I had no laundry they sometimes barged right past me into the room. Perhaps they didn't understand my attempts at no thanks. We tried the restaurant twice. Once for soup. It was watery and tasteless and the breakfast was bad. They tout it as western but my omlette was horrible. I know it is a small hotel and shouldn't be compared to the breakfast at the Westin Bund, but it could have been better. Oh, there's no currency exchange either. It's about a 8 mins walk to a bank .A big problem and this is not the hotel's fault...is that taxi drivers have no idea where this place is - even when you have the little map. I know sometimes taxi drivers just don't want to take you, but this was really, really bad. If we did not have native Chinese speakers with us I don't know if we would ever have found our way to the hotel. I loved being in this area as I have been to Shanghai several times but if it was my first trip I would suggest the bund/nanjing road area as it was quite a ride to old town etc. Plus there was always the taxi problem. Overall a great, atmopsheric place to stay but don't expect the Ritz service. Also, I may hav e the name wrong but do try and eat at the Yong Foo Elite(???) It used to be the British consulate before the war and again it's like stepping back into the 1930s. "
mansion hotel ,"Adored The Mansion Just returned from a week in Shanghai where I stayed at the China Mansion Hotel. I was taking my daughter to her study abroad program and really wanted to stay somwhere luxurious and memorable. The Mansion delivers on both counts. Located in the former French concession the hotel is a private home that has been lovingly converted to a lavish 33 room hotel - one of the nicest I've ever been to (and I've been lucky enough to have stayed in some of the very best). My room was enormous, with high ceilings, a private terrace and a beautifully appointed bathroom with a tub that was practically big enough to do laps in. Despite the language barrier (The Mansion is not the Marriott in this regard) the level of service was superb. Prompt room service, a fantastic rooftop restaurant for drinks and/or dinner, and an attentive staff that anticipated my every need. I also loved the location which was both convenient and enough out of the main tourist crush to make you feel as though China is really just outside your door. A great value for the money..... "
mansion hotel ,"Gorgeous Rooms Needed A/C in the rooftop restaurant The hotel reception was beautiful, filled with antiques and photographs of old Shanghai. A really nice reception. Checkin went smoothly. The rooms were fantastic! Huge rooms, very comfortable bed, and a massive bathroom. The hi-tech toilet was a bit overwhelming (had to leave the light off to keep the toilet from switching on!), but the massive bathtub with jets was wonderful. Only issue with the entire stay was we spent some time in the rooftop restaurant / lounge during happy hour one afternoon. We were the only guests and the A/C kept on turning off. It was extremely hot and humid, and not at all comfortable. "
mansion hotel ,"Great location but not a 5-Star Hotel Please keep in mind that this was our first time to China, for a long weekend. So, I am comparing this to how a 5-star hotel should be.On the upside:1. The hotel's location is ideally located in the heart of the French Concession. There are lots of curious shops within walking distance; it's a great place to start a stroll.2. The hotel itself is a magnificent old building and once inside the lobby, you feel a world apart from the Shanghai chaos outside. 3. We were keen to avoid a business-hotel feel. It certainly feels more boutique than the chains.4. We had a Superior King room. The room was large and met specification. They've tried to give the rooms something of a period feel, by decking them out with (fake) antique furniture.On the downside:1. We took the Weekend Package - stay 2 nights and get 3rd free. I noticed afterwards that the room rate/night that is used to calculate the price of two nights for this package was higher than the basic rate if I had just booked two nights (though it still came in slightly cheaper on the Weekend Package).2. The service was terrible. The desk staff had no idea about what I would regard as basic knowledge for a 5-star hotel, eg the names or addresses of the best-known restaurants in town. We cannot have been their first customers to request a cab to Jean Georges. Worse still, one night the staff gave the cab driver the wrong address for the restaurant ... fortunately I had a guide book in my back pocket. Maybe the staff/concierge need more training. We also ran out of toilet paper one night .3. It took a while for people to appear and things to happen, eg we waited a few minutes for someone to show us a table in the lobby for a drink. 4. The breakfast is expensive for what it is and not up to 5-star hotel standard. I'd recommend eating outside.Maybe these are all small points, but when you are paying more than $250 per night, with a 15% service fee on everything, this all counts. "
mansion hotel ,"Shockingly Bad We made our reservation at the Mansion Hotel with great expectations ... and could hardly have been more disappointed. Yes, the hotel has many beautiful features, but nothing could make up for the truly dreadful service and serious problems with our room. The hotel staff was consistently cold, unhelpful, and often hostile, especially those at the front desk. We were checked in without so much as a &quot;welcome&quot; or a smile. Because we had missed lunch and were hungry when we arrived, we asked if they could recommend something in the area. In response, we were given a map with the hotel circled on it, and were told that there were many restaurants in the area. After 45 minutes of walking (apparently we had headed in the wrong direction), we returned to ask for more help. We were then told that the restaurant on the 5th floor of the hotel was open, and we could have lunch there. Why this information wasn't initially offered is a mystery. Our room, while nicely appointed (although quite small), had serious issues that were never addressed. Most importantly, there was mold growing on the ceiling and an oppressive mold smell that permeated the room. The hall lights outside of our room were never turned on, making returning at night through a dark hallway a fairly creepy experience. There was no response to our repeated requests to have these problems dealt with. We booked a &quot;VIP package&quot;, which was to include champagne upon arrival, flowers in the room, and two massages. There was no champagne (never did manage to receive it), the flowers were sad, and we received the massages only after our reminders that this was to be included in our package. Unfortunately, there was no glimmer of hospitality from the beginning of our stay until the end. The final blow was when someone chased us out to our car, as we were leaving for the airport, to say that housekeeping had reported that we consumed one more minibar coke than had originally been reported, and we owed them an additional five dollars (remember the champagne that we never received?). We are travelers who love small hotels and had hoped that this would be an experience to remember. Unfortunately, the Mansion was devoid of the kind of service and attention to detail that make staying in a small &quot;boutique&quot; hotel a special experience. The Mansion Hotel is not what it appears to be. I would suggest that you find a cool night to visit the top floor outdoor restaurant for drinks, but avoid staying at this hotel at all costs. "
mansion hotel ,"Disappointed The Mansion isn’t a bad hotel. It’s clean and comfortable and its location in the heart of the French Concession is ideal for exploring Shanghai. However, the hotel’s prices (for rooms, food, laundry—most everything) are at the top of the line for China and it fails to meet an international 5 star level in some significant ways.Service1. For reasons that I was unable to determine, most of the staff seems quite unhappy. There was no warmth or friendliness in the service, even from staff members that we saw several times during our three-night stay. One of the reasons we like to stay in smaller hotels (like the Mansion) is because we prefer a more personal experience. We felt as anonymous here as we would felt have at a Marriott with 1,000 rooms.2. The hotel charges a 15% service fee on top of its already high prices on almost everything. In addition, the staff hover around after they perform every service and are clearly expecting tips. I suspect that little if any of the service charge goes to the staff and this may explain the unhappy staff attitude I mentioned in point 1. However, the practice of charging for service and then having the staff expect tips is outrageous and should stop immediately.3. We encountered some glaring service gaps. For example, we arrived back at the hotel at 9.30 pm on a Saturday evening and wanted to have a drink. We went up to the bar on the fifth floor and it was closed for a private function. We went back to the nearly empty lobby lounge and sat down in full view of several staff members. No one came and asked us if we wanted anything. After 10 minutes I got up and told a staff member that we wanted to order a drink. Rather than take our order, the staff member said he would get someone from the bar. 10 minutes later no one had appeared and I had to get up and ask again. Someone finally arrived and took our order about 30 minutes after we sat down and our (expensive) drinks arrived 10 minutes after that. Again, the server clearly expected a tip even though the order included a 15% service charge.4. Service in the restaurant on the 5th floor was disorganized—almost chaotic. I could never tell which waiter was in charge of our table (different waiters appeared throughout the meal), part of our order was forgotten and another part was given to the table next to us.Design Design preferences are very personal and I understand that other people may find the hotel’s design attractive. I did not.1. The lobby is fussy and cluttered and it often has an unpleasant food odor wafting through it.2. Our room was large but the space was not used very effectively. There was a very large bed (that’s fine) and an overly large (almost silly) desk, armchair and footrest. There was also a large, fake fireplace. The wardrobe for hanging clothes was too small and there were no drawers for clothes. If space had been used more effectively, there would have been room for a small, but cozy sitting area with a sofa and chairs and adequate room for clothes.3. The lamps next to the bed do not provide enough light for reading—you have to keep the overhead light on.4. The shower curtain is inadequate and water floods the bathroom floor.5. Our room had many shiny/glossy/reflective surfaces and mirrors. It’s looks like a Chinese version of Las Vegas style and I did not care for it.To summarize, there is nothing seriously wrong with the Mansion and its location is excellent. However, for the prices being charged I expect better, friendlier service and the design of the hotel did not appeal to me. "
mansion hotel ,"Perfect Start to China Trip My wife and I stayed at the Chna Mansion Hotel for three nights in May (during Labor Day holiday). When our guide we hired picked us up at the airport, his first words almost were you picked a great hotel , in the best part of city. We had seen pictures on the internet of hotel, but was really impressed when we pulled in through the gates. The lobby was old school with many nice antiques. Check in was easy. We were brought to our room, the cheapest one in hotel. It was huge with a fireplace, antique desk and one of the nicest bathrooms. The toilet had a heated seat and electronic controls, took a little time to figure out which button flushed the thing. I realy liked the charm of the hotel and feel of the old luxury of China, not the new skyscraper hotels where your room # is 3615. After take a brief nap, 15 hour nonstop flight, we went up to the rooftop terrace to take a look. One of the best feautures of the hotel, as Shanghai is extremely crowded, noisy and has lots of pollution, it was like being on your own island where you could relax and have a drink. We ate breakfast everymorning ther and truly enjoyed it. The Sunday brunch was excellent, as the eggs dishes. The location is very easy to get around. The most we paid for a cab was 20 yuan, during rush hour to the Bund. The rest of the time around 12 yuan (less than two US dollars). We loved walking around Old Shanghai. I would recommend this hotel to someone looking for a hideaway within one of the most busy and biggest cities in the world. As for some guests on this board complaints about the staff, I think alot of this is due to Chinese is most of the staffs first language and as the saying is goes &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. My wife and I both have different first languages and we even have some problems communicating with each other sometimes due to misunderstanding. The staff has several Americans and Europeans on it and during our stay they were very helpful as were all of the staff. "
mansion hotel ,"Luxury Experience of 1930's Shanghai In today’s world, we are never lack of luxury hotels. Especially, as you stay in UAE, there are so many 6 stars or even 7 stars hotels all around and there will be more and more. The Jumeirah, Rotana, the Shangri-La, Hyatt, JW Marriott and Le Méridien etc, you will find they are more or less same with big hall, shining- shining decoration, 500 above rooms or suites, 6-7 restaurants with presentable staffs. While you are on biz trip, you would be like these conveniences that modern luxury hotels could always provide to you. But while on leisure time, I definitely need something different. After long time searching and comparing, we choose the Mansion Hotel. The building and its decoration are lovely as well as their staffs. They are always be there to be ready for answering all the questions that you may ask about the building, the neighborhood and the city. They also have one of most comfortable hotel beds that I ever slept on. The bathroom is as big as many bathrooms you only could find in luxury suite of 5 stars hotels even my room is just a normal deluxe room. With a nice of view of the local residents’ areas, I felt that I touched the best part of real Shanghai! The hotel also has a rooftop restaurant called Skyline. The lunch set menu is a good choice before you start to explore the city. And the Sunday brunch was also nice if you get late and just want have a lazy and casual day. I did not try their dinner. But I think it will be a good idea to have some drinks at their terrace during late night time. If I get any chance back to Shanghai, I will definitely return my home away home again. "
mansion hotel ,"Magic at the Mansion We asked our friends in Shanghai where we should stay when we came to visit them. We asked for a place that was different from the 5 star hotel's we usually stay at. They said they had the perfect place and left it up to them. I am very thankful I did, as we wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else.From the moment we drove into the gates of the Mansion we were amazed at what we saw. The fountains bubbling beside the beautiful gardens and a lobby overloaded with classic pieces from early this centuary. Once we were checked in by the front desk (quite slowly), we were lead to our room. The rooms are great! Massive bathrooms with a nice small deck to sit outside on. The big TV was perfect for us to watch the cheap DVD's we brought from down the road. Breakfast everyday had a good variety and we loved sitting out on the deck at night . Indulging in a few social drinks and immersing ourselves in the panoramic view on offer. The view is one of a kind and needs to be seen to be believed. Our whole stay was great, except for the fact that they didn't change foreign currency at the front desk. Chinese banks are a nightmare. These things are to be expected. However the experience is something to learn from.We are so glad we trusted our friends and will continue to do so for a long time to come. I would happily reccommend Mansion Hotel to everyone travelling to Shanghai. "
mansion hotel ,"Horrendous Experience Being a member of SHL, this hotel totally failed our expectation. We stayed for 2 nights only. The rooms look nice, but when you look closer, you can see that they used cheap material to pretend that they are luxurious. Some of the decorations are simply not right, such as the paintings on the bathroom wall, and the plant in the room. What we have most issue with is their service. The breakfast was just bad. The buffet part was sad and the entree part was bad. The staff there, they either didn't know what to do, or they didn't care. No matter what we asked for, we could't get it from them, from a fork to a taxi. If we managed to get it, it would be after rushing them a few times.When we checked out, we requested to store our luggage at the concierge, which is like the most common request that you can expect from the guests, but they said no, due to &quot;security reason for the Olympics&quot;. After arguing for 5 minutes, and 3 times &quot;we really can't store your luggage here&quot;, we asked to speak to the GM of the hotel. The most funny thing is: the reception said she could not reach him, and it was 10:00am on a Monday! Eventually we were offered complimentary late check-out until 6:00pm. However, when our friends checked out the room, they only offered them complimentary late check-out until 3:00pm, right in front of us! The more ridiculous thing was, my another friend checked out later and they stored their luggage at the concierge without any difficulty! This example clearly shows that they have absolutely no clue about service.This hotel has a beautiful facade, but once you look closer, you will reject it as fast as you can. If you have made your booking, I wish you luck! "
mansion hotel ,"adored Mansion Hotel Shanghai I must admit that I was a little nervous about arriving in Shanghai alone, but all that changed when I saw the limousine driver from China Mansion Hotel holding up a sign with my name on it. From then on I was in heaven. From the moment I stepped into the romantic historical lobby I knew I had made the right decision to stay in the French Concession are rather than the space age Pudong side. The accomodation at the Mansion is reminiscent of the Peninsula in Hong Kong, with a much more intimate feel. The lobby is without retail outlets and feels like the entrance to a grand old home, which in fact it once was. As I was a little timid at the begining about wandering around alone until my husband was to join me in four days time, I think I treated every member of the staff as if they were my parents and should look after me !!! This they did and more.......I ended up wandering around the magical streets and laneways every night till late......very safe and always full of people. Taxis are so inexpensive if you don't feel like walking. A bubble bath in the evening was de rigeur before sitting at the bureau full of all the staionery you need and working at my computer. When my husband did arrive he said WOW and then how much is this costing?! Surprisingly, the Mansion is not expensive for a 5 star hotel. Don't let your taxi driver take you to the wrong mansion hotel though, as there are a few in Shanghai with the word mansion in them. Shanghai is a beautiful city with its colourful history ever present around every corner from the Bund back. Sitting in on of the many beautiful spots at the Bund looking across at the &quot;Jetsons&quot; space age architecture which we explored many times, I decided that the experience has been so good for my soul, business and social life, Shanghai is my new obsession and the Mansion my home away from home.Angela Batley.Double Bay. SydneyAustralia "
mansion hotel ,"A nice surprise... I'd be lying if I said that our heart didn't sink a bit when we entered the China Mansion hotel. A musty smell hangs in the air, and the thick carpets, and proliferation of photos, momentos and 'period' pieces leaves one weaving through the lobby. But I can honestly say that by the end of our trip, I wouldn't have gone anywhere else in Shanghai.The location is excellent - sitting in the middle of the French Concession, and it is very good value, just $200 for a huge and very comfortable room with balcony and the bizarre and amusing breakfast (including a woefully understocked 'buffet', and cooked menu of your choice). Compared to the surprisingly tatty &quot;new&quot; hotels in Shanghai (we visited and saw rooms in both the JW Mariot and Four Seasons), the China Mansion was wonderfully eccentric.Yes, there are problems. The hotel is on a busy junction and the rooms were quite noise. The service, though enthusiastic, was not the most efficient (the car booked for the airport turned up half an hour late with the excuse &quot;well, it's Monday&quot;), and the smell of chinese food and cabbage had a tendency to waft through the corridors. But all-in-all, I would recommend China Mansion - if I returned to Shanghai, I'd happily stay there again. "
mansion hotel ,"Bad Place To Be The service and amenities are so substandard I think the reviews here are fake!An email for an extended stay was totally ignored twice. Guess I should have known.Asking at the desk for a map-&quot;we have none&quot;Asking for a guide-&quot;We have none&quot;Asking for reccommendations -BlankAsked to have pot of my new tea made while I sat in lobby &quot;We charge for Tea&quot; ok, my tea comes out in an inappropriate pot with boxed cookies ($2 for a 100 cookies)...Us $5At breakfast there really is nothing, the same cookies appear in a bowl, ask for yogurt, nuts, coffee..2nd coffee-the usual Americano watered version-&quot;we charge...only 1 coffee/juice for breakfast&quot; I am told.There is a large flat screen TV for Hallmark, HBO, CNN--that's it.Nice bathroom, but its service that makes or breaks a hotel stay and this is simply way below the worst in my 3 months in Asia. "
mansion hotel ,"The Utimate plush hotel in China Excellent service quality assurance with the aid of New Zealnd ambassador Samuel Finnerty, who made this experience exceptional. His wealth of knowledge for a social experience and organisation made this trip comfortable and a pleasure to be home away from home. "
mansion hotel ,"Sumptuous even over-the-top..... My partner and I visited Shanghai over the Chinese New Year holiday when the city was absolutely cold and freezing. The China Mansion Hotel provided us however with a refuge to keep us warm during our brief stay. The hotel is a gem in the middle of a city known more for high-rise glitz and glamour offered by sterile hotel chains. Every inch of this unique property is filled with priceless antiques and memorabilia that must be seen to be believed. Our deluxe suite was huge with a cavernous ceiling. The furnitures were plush and sumptuous, a great departure from the minimalist trend that is so common to most hotels these days. The bathroom was gorgeous but quite cold as it was not heated like the bedroom. What the hotel lacks in standard amenities like a business center or a gym, it makes up for in character and hospitality. The location is very convenient if the Huaihai Road shopping is on top of your agenda as it is only a 5 minute walk. Alternatively, the Bund area and Nanjing Road can be reached either by taxi (around 12 RMB) or by subway (2 stops at 3 RMB). The popular Yuyuan Gardens can also be reached by cab and the approximate fare should be around 15 RMB. For travellers who prefer to stay in a unique and historical place, then this lovely hotel will surely get high marks. "
mansion hotel ,"Gangster glamour in old Shanghai We wanted to stay somewhere convenient in an above average place with character. China Mansion Hotel was recommended to us by an expat resident of Shanghai and met our critieria and more. This place has to be seen to be believed. The time warp to pre-war Shanghai happens as you step through the front door, though the location of this renovated 1930s gangster's villa in a busier part of the former French Concession helps prepare the ground. The reception area is kitted out in dark wood, period-style armchairs and glass cabinets, to which a generous portion of kitsch memorabilia has been added. The walls abound with fascinating pictures of old Shanghai. Our suite was spacious, with a combination of Chinese furniture and features and old-fashioned club furniture: high backed leather chairs etc. The bed was huge and comfortable. Only very minor grumbles were the bedside lighting - too dim to read by - and the heating - set very high. Our room faced the street, which gets noisy early. Even with the double glazing, street sounds do filter through. But it didn't disturb us.The bathroom was luxurious: lots of marble and mirrors, a rainforest style soaking shower and vast bath with jacuzzi. But the lack of heating meant it was a tad chilly on a December morning! However, the toilet seat was heated!The rooftop restaurant where we had breakfast was wonderfully bright with views over the surrounding area (including a Russian Orthodox Church opposite the hotel entrance). Too cold to sit outside, though they do have heaters for the evening. Breakfast was fine: nouvelle cuisine meets continental. Didn't try it for other meals but the blackboard announcing gluhwein and winter BBQ appealed. Service was excellent. We were given an upgrade, which helps (not least as this is an expensive place to stay), but as I've found at other hotels in China staff were keen to help without fawning over you. The excellent manager, Sam Finnerty, met us on arrival and farewelled us. Getting a cab in Shanghai can be a nightmare but the concierge got us one on both evenings we needed one. If you want a view of the Yangtse, Pudong or the Bund this isn't the place, but when you walk out the front door you feel as though you're in a neighbourhood with history and character. The local metro station is just 5 minutes walk away on one of Shanghai's most fashionable shopping streets, Huaihai Road. And there are lots of boutiques in the immediate vicinity.We will definitely stay here again and will be recommending this hotel to friends and colleagues. If you want pre-war Shanghai glamour with luxury (and excellent plumbing!), this place is very hard to beat. "
mansion hotel ,"Loved the Place!!! Lovely Hotel with even more lovely staff. We were there for two nights and had the most luxurious stay ever. The rooms were amazing and th restaurant a beautiful view. Will be back to Shanghai again next year and wouldn't stay anywhere else. Price was pretty high, but worth every cent we paid "

mansion hotel ,"Mansion Hotel - setting new boutique hotel standards in Shanghai! It should have been listed as the MOST LUXURIOUS boutique hotel in Shanghai! Historic heritage building beautifully restored, as if you've stepped back into old charm of 1930s Shanghai, updated with today's luxury. We stayed in the delux (basic) room - it was enough to WOW us. 60sq m room with 3m high ceiling, gorgeously decorated, equipped with free wi-fi, jacuzzi for 2 people, a spa-shower and toilet with seat-warmers! Notice the thick luxurious carpet in the lobby, walkways and in the room, they were specially tailored made and imported for this hotel. We were told that the beautiful 2meter floor lamps in the lobby and in the room were designed by the owners. Evening drinks on the roof top restaurant gives you a spectacular view of the city. Not to be missed! We enjoyed our stay here very much, once in the room, the windows shut out the noise from the busy street, and you'll forget you're right in the middle of a busy city center!

marriott executive apartments pudong shanghai ,"Great Value Excellent Hotel These apartments are just wonderful. The rooms we stayed in, were, I think, at the &quot;left back&quot; which had a fantastic view - the higher the floor. We stayed on 7th floor for 3 nights, then stayed in Hangzhou Hyatt regency for one night – (to see Solar Eclipse - Main reason for our trip) - and then stayed a further night on top (38th) floor....wished we had asked for a higher room for our earlier stay. We looked out towards the Oriental Pearl Tower and World Trade Centre..which we nicknamed the bottle opener....The window stretched the whole side and round the front &quot;end&quot; of the apartment, which gave a fantastic panoramic view...especially great at night.The members of staff are very courteous and efficient. Very helpful, particularly as we had problems with our credit card having been blocked by our bank after first use, (Foreign travel/Bank issues...another story). Reception staff not at all phased and very willing to find solution. Every request was met quickly and nothing seemed too much trouble...we were very jet lagged (15 hours out of sync from home) and probably seemed a bit grumpy at times...but they accommodated that.The rooms are very spacious, ours was wedge shaped, but looking at fire plan on back of room front door, there were at least 4 different types of layout. The room was very clean...I am extremely fussy about cleanliness in any type of rented accommodation, especially in kitchens and bathrooms, and to be honest I could hardly fault either...it was almost as if we were the first to use the room after a new fitting out....We had one large bedroom with comfortable king-size bed, large plasma TV (separate to living room TV), loads of cupboard space, both hanging and drawers, a safe and iron and ironing board...hidden in cupboard. The living room had a sectional sofa (chaise) (this was a bit hard and had silk throw cushions which slipped about, so a tad uncomfortable), a glass topped coffee table and matching side table (not glass), glass dinner table with two comfortable chairs, desk and chair with internet access via cable (wireless would have been preferred), large plasma TV...with connections for your own AV devices via wall sockets. All the rooms were literally packed with features and almost everything had been thought of. An extra rollaway bed was provided for us, was a bit pricey considering we had booked an advance purchase rate of 890RMB, 300RMB for an extra bed rather bumped up the price....but still very good value overall.The fully equipped kitchen has upscale fittings, including a “sensing” microwave, full oven, garbage disposal, dishwasher and large fridge with three drawer freezer. The Bathroom has a front loading washing machine and separate tumble dryer.Recommend you take with you a small supply of dishwashing liquid, dishwasher tablets and clothes washing powder/liquid. Was difficult to find in local shops and very expensive for much more than needed for a short stay. The utensils in the kitchen, including knife block, full set of pots and pans and full sets of crockery, cutlery, and glasses were of an excellent standard. You could certainly prepare and cook as if you were at home...but you need to bring/buy everything food wise like oil and condiments etc. We found a “supermarket” in the basement of the local upscale shopping mall. It had everything you could need, but I suspect as prices in China go this was the Marks and Spencer end of the market. E.g. 99RMB for a medium sized bottle of concentrated washing liquid (clothes)...about US$15....But the fruit and veg were great, and they even sold Speckled Old Hen cans of beer........The bathroom has a large bathtub, deep and long enough for a good soak, with a hand held shower attachment and also a separate glass shower cubicle. In the roomy tiled and glass doored shower cubicle the fittings to switch from overhead rain shower to hand-held were a bit tricky (because of trendy square design), but the water pressure is excellent, so a great showering experience.I see others thought breakfast only average....I found it excellent for this type of hotel, a large choice of different types of breakfast including “American” bacon and sausage, Chinese dishes, continental cheeses, cereals, fruit, juices, toast, pastries etc....The room service, however, left a bit to be desired, I suppose that because these are “serviced apartments” you cannot expect the usual room service quality. The food itself was mostly OK, however it was disappointing that it was not always as described...e.g. the torpedo steak sandwich was not the tender steak advertised in the menu, (but then again they rarely are)...however it was missing the “roasted onions”, which meant that it was lacking in taste...when I complained, instead of bringing up a small dish of onions they came and took the plate away to add them....and brought back the same meal...now cold....(lucky able to heat up in the kitchen...). Then, on another occasion when only a snack was needed, the “crispy chicken wings with hot chilli and lemon mayonnaise” were not crispy...and arrived only with tomato ketchup...which they later tried to say was “spicy ketchup”. but it was still tomayo ketchup!!!...They brought up a small dish of plain mayonnaise....hmmm...sent meal back...However they were most concerned and phoned up afterwards to check i was OK. Also there were no condiments sent, no salt and pepper and no napkins.... let alone any of the usual room service frills....The pool and Spa were too cold for me, but the steam room and sauna suite and showers in the changing area were great. (Although would have been even better if not opposite the loos). We live in Caribbean, so we are used to warm water and hot sun, lounging in the cool pool area just wasn't warm enough for me, but I am sure anyone from a temperate climate would love it. But it was a shame that at the least the Jacuzzi wasn't hot.However all in all an excellent place to say, great value and although not in the tourist area, had easy connections via Metro (short walk) to rest of Shanghai...and Taxis were easy to get to and from...DO take a label with the hotel name on in Chinese for taxi drivers...English is hardly spoken, and that includes the ability to read addresses and street names in English. Pointing at the English name of a street on a map in a guide book is no good. We took a supply of labels printed in Chinese...they proved invaluable. Cut and paste from here.....(we stuck one in the guide book).http://www.sinohotelguide.com/detail_index.php?Hotel_ID=SSGH0114&amp;City_ID=SSG&amp;City_Cname=Shang%20Hai&amp;City_Lname=shanghai Useful advice for any hotel in China "

marriott executive apartments pudong shanghai ,"Very nice apartments near PuDong Times Square This hotel is very nice, but caters to the extended stay. They really prefer to rent the rooms by the month, but will do it on a daily or weekly basis if needed.The room consisted of a kitchen, dining room, living room and large bathroom with tub and shower. There were 2 plasma TV's. The breakfast was adequate, but not as good as some of the other Western breakfasts in the area. Dinner isn't available in the hotel, although there are many nearby. The only downside for me was that the internet connection to the USA was EXTREMELY slow, and since I was using a Slingbox to the USA, this kept me from enjoying my stay and I chose to move back to the Courtyard Marriott (accommodations not as nice, but friendlier people and internet).Since internet service in Asia can be iffy at times, it might have been that they were having problems the week I was there.The room can also get very hot in the Summer, since the thermostat prevents the room from getting really cool. I understand that this is a government rule to save energy, and not necessarily a rule of the hotel. "
marriott executive apartments pudong shanghai ,"Nicest Place I've Ever Stayed What a place! I'm rarely 'over impressed' with a hotel, but WOW! It's technically not a hotel, rather 'apartments'. Very modern and new decor (the place has only been open about a year). HUGE living room, FULL kitchen, gorgeous bathroom with a separate jacuzzi tub and stand-alone shower. The bedroom alone was the size of a standard hotel room--big comfy bed. My room was on an angle, which gave me floor-to-ceiling windows spanning the entire room with about a 180 degree view of Shanghai. Two plasma TVs (about a 32 incher in the bedroom and a 50 inch one in the living room). All rates include breakfast...A very good one by Shanghai standards. Mostly Western selections with a few Chinese ones.The staff was very good. And the location is good...A block from my company's Shanghai operations and plenty of restaurants right near the hotel.I said I could never live in Shanghai, but I take that back--I could live in Shanghai if I could call this place home. Again, THE BEST place I've ever stayed (and I stay in hotels 60-80 nights a year). "
mason hotel shanghai ,"Good location This hotel is more like a mid to up market service apartment rather than a hotel, we spent 6 days and found it reasonable for the price as it is in an excellent location.The hotel is in a block about 8 floors high in the central of HuaiHai Road, the upmarket shopping street of Shanghai. The beauty of its location is that it is right above the Shanxi (South) road subway station on line#1. Sightseeing via both subway and buses is therefore very convenient even if you get tired of walking around the shopping street itself. The hotel staff are helpful and found us carpark space for our visiting friends as well as directed us to take the subway to the Shanghai circus station for a show called ERA, it was a fantastic show!The rooms are average size but we had a bigger room in the end of the block as we asked for a quiet room away from main streets where busy traffic can be seen or heard. The bathroom is a bit small but with sufficient accessories and fittings for a pleasant stay, bath and showers both work well. There are tea making facility in the room and also free broadband internet common in all China hotels. The furniture are adequate but slightly worn out. Breakfast was a good spread catering Chinese, Japanese and western style food in the top floor restaurant. Food quality is reasonable but juice and coffee are way below standard. For those who need coffee fix, there is a Starbucks next door and also a few fast food outlets across the street for those desperate for western comfort food. The Chinese style porridge is the best I have tasted since visiting HongKong but the eggs and omellettes were presented in a terrible mess. The hotel has bargains for business men who needs a room at last minute: every evening the hotel seems to have a sign selling single rooms at RMB530 inclusive of all facilities like car parking!

Parkson Plaza Department Store is directly across the road, to stock up on bottled water and champagne. Starbucks is downstairs to kickstart you for the day.

Some rooms don't have a bath, but just a walk in shower. There is a tv with limited english channels. No other entertainment. However the broadband access is free, via an ethernet port. Outside the rooms note there is no swimming pool, but a small gym equipment room, and two pool tables.There is a roof top bar, however it may only be open in summer, as it was closed (despite signs saying it is open). There is a ground floor starbucks, and many good places to eat nearby within walking distance.Breakfast is available - a buffet of chinese and various western foods. Don't expect a continental or full english breakfast, but you will find something to suit you.I have always stayed at the rear of the hotel, which is quiet. Overall, a good western style hotel, particularly suited to business travellers. "
mason hotel shanghai ,"Really liked the Mason Hotel: excellent value for money We really enjoyed our stay at the Mason Hotel in Shanghai. Although located on a busy shopping road (Huaihai road), in a town where the traffic is very noisy, the traffic noise in the room was acceptable (on the 7th floor). That was the only downside, explaining the less than perfect score. However, half the rooms (even numbers?) are on the other side of the hotel, which should be very quiet (not from experience) .Room comfort and spaciousness was excellent, and far superior to what we got for double the price in Hong Kong, our subsequent stopover. Located in the heart of the elegant French Concession, and right above South Shaanxi metro station, with easy access to rest of city and right in the midst of many good services and tourist sights. There is a HSBC ATM next to the lobby.The hotel interior has a clean, peacefull, elegant and modern feel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast facilities were excellent offering a mix of local and Western food. Terrific value for money. "

mayfair hotel shanghai ,"So-so hotel uninterested staff Stayed six nights in Aug-2009 in a room facing Zongshan Park on the 21st floor and then another with no view on the 23rd floor. The rooms are pretty decent and the hotel itself is nice. One of the best features for travellers is the metro station right next to the hotel. The biggest problem is the staff - almost no one can speak English, so having any sort of conversation is a problem. As an example, our laundry had issues on more than one occasion and each time, they would send a note in Chinese, delivered by someone who did not speak a word of English!! The redemption lay in the fact that the operator at the end of the Services button (0 on the phone) was keen and usually resolved the issue, though it took more than one call on every occasion.Shockingly, bell desk/concierge staff seem to be most unfriendly of the lot, totally uninterested in dealing with guest requests. Front desk staff rate a close second in the uninterested and unmotivated category.The gym is pretty decent, especially since it overlooks Zongshan Park and one can see loads of people out for walks/practising Tai Chi in the mornings.Taking staff attitude into consideration, a very average hotel to stay in.

mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel Stayed three nights at the Mayfair. Very comfortable bed, pleasant quiet room, nice bathroom. Robe, slippers, supplied. Electric kettle, drinks, minibar. Breakfast buffet was superb. We had room service which was fast and very good. Staff friendly. Lots of shops nearby and places to eat out. Near underground station for getting around, but taxis are cheap too. Did not notice that the water smelled bad. Window of room could be opened for fresh air if necessary. Drapes kept light out well. Used laundry but it is somewhat expensive, although excellent. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"OK Hotel The hotel is easily accessible from the metro (Zhongshan Park, lines 2,3,4) - Exit #5 from the station. It is about a five minute walk to the actual station which can be done via an underground passageway. Line 2 runs to Long Yong Rd where the Maglev runs to Pudong. So for RMB44, it is possible to get from Pudong to the hotel within one hour (taxi runs about RMB200 and more than an hour during peak traffic).The hotel tap water does smell funny/fishy. This is only for this hotel as I have stayed at numerous hotels in Shanghai and Beijing within this happening. The hotel staff speaks sufficient english, but few are fluent enough for troubleshooting deep issues. The hotel seems to cater to more local / asian business people although I did also see the crew from Lufthansa. The area around the hotel is surrounded by high rise residence, so it gives more of a local feel rather than a tourist feel like around Nanjing rd. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Nice hotel good quality We stayed here for three nights during a tour of China (our second tour of China).The hotel was an excellent standard, with good food and excellent accommodation.We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but we did enjoy the excellent and wide-ranging breakfast. There are many eating places nearby so it is no problem finding somewhere nice to eat.The rooms were an excellent standard. Clean and sumptously furnished and decorated.The service was excellent. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"There are some things in my mind.... First of all, tap water smells bad... but is this because of the hotel ? or.. is this the problem of this city ?The tap water in Beijing doesn`t smell that bad....Room is fine, except the fact that they charge internet at RMB 120 per day.Someone was saying the internet was slow.Yes, it is slow as they charge money.Breakfast is a crap except for croissant. Western dishes are fine, but Chinese dishes are not.... I didnt touch Chinese dishes from the day 2.Staffs are kind and can speak English okey.I purchased a package tour of flight and hotel, so I dont know how much the room is in fact, If the price is around US 100 including breakfast and tax, I would NOT complain.The hotel is not in the center of Shanghai, but is very close to aZhong Shan Park Station, although I used taxi most of the time. (RMB15-25 per trip to most of the sightseeing sites or restaurants.)Taxi from People`s Park to the hotel was 15-20 mins.Taxi from the airport to the hotel costed RMB 170 at night (40-50 mins)Taxi from the hotel to Mag-lev station was RMB 80 in the morning(25 mins)I do recommend this hotel AS LONG AS the price is USD 100 includng breakfast and tax, whatever the season is.Otherwise, you should spend more time to net-surf tofind better hotels.You would realize that there are plenty of hotels in Shanghai. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Beware....of Annex Building On a recent trip to Shanghai, I booked a reservation that I thought was the New World Mayflower Hotel in Shanghai. However, upon check-in I was told that my room was in the &quot;Annex&quot; building. The annex building turned out on to be a different hotel, the Penta Hotel. The rooms at the Penta Hotel were NOTHING of what I expected of the Mayflower based on previously viewed internet pictures. There was no information about the Mayflower hotel in the room at all. I was completely disappointed and would not recommend the hotel. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Great for the price This is a great hotel for the price and is, in my opinion, in a better location than many of the more expensive hotels. the room was well presented, clean and modern. The lobby was really nice. Check in was quite slow and don't expect the staff to be too overtly friendly, but they were professional. The bar is very expensive and the prices they are charging are no reflection of costs in Shanghai. It's a case of rob the tourist. the staff constantly ask if you would like a drink, another drink, pour your drink from the can etc. and their constant presence is quite unnerving and very unnecessary. Just leave us alone!!A fair price for a very good hotel. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Very Good Hotel Great Value I staid in the New World Mayfair Hotel for a couple of days during a visit to Shanghai. It wasn't perfect but it's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses. The rooms were clean, stylish and well appointed. Most amenities such as internet, the fitness center and sauna were free. (Although the sauna was not the best I've seen in Asia.) Breakfast was free and on the whole quite decent if not exceptional. The staff was generally very courteous.The location is not quite in the center of the city but it is in a good neighborhood with plenty of restaurants. It is right near a subway station and you can get to the major tourist attractions pretty quickly. The hotel restaurant was also reasonable and pretty good (although I only had one meal there). On the whole, this was a very good hotel. The price is very reasonable (around $130). It might not be quite as luxurious as some of the best 5 star hotels in Shanghai, but given that it's less than half the price of the Hyatt and others, I have to give it my strong endorsement. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Very Nice Business-Type Hotel As part of our recent China tour, my hubby and I stayed at the New World Mayfair Hotel in Shanghai on May 23 and 24, 2008. We arrived late in the evening and there was still a bit of a wait to check in (several folks in front of us). We were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a king, non-smoking room on one of the executive levels of the hotel (room 3106). The room was large with all of the usual amenities. We had a lovely view of the park adjacent to the hotel. The only downside for us was the bed was very hard. We both like a hard mattress....but this was VERY HARD. Breakfast was your standard buffet (wait staff seemed quite bored and service was slow and poor). We didn't know that we could eat at the executive level lounge, instead of the regular breakfast buffet. No one ever explained the benefits of the executive level floor to us...we found the lounge on our own (nice views, complimentary beverages, magazines and newspapers). Plenty to see and do in Shanghai. We especially enjoyed the Shanghai acrobatic show and the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center. Hotel is located a good distance from many of the &quot;attractions&quot;....so you will need to travel by taxi or public transport. We did not try it, but were told the subway system is very &quot;user friendly.&quot; The park across from the hotel is lovely and great for walking. Standard western chain restaurants are close-by (Pizza Hut, KFC, etc.) Also a supermarket (Carrefour) within walking distance. Hotel is very modern with beautiful public areas. Very busy in the lobby area. We did have a bit of a wait to check-out (even at 7:30 AM). We didn't see very many tourists ...mostly business people. But this seemed like a very nice, business type hotel and except for the hard bed and slow service at breakfast, we were quite comfortable here. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Loved this hotel ! This is a really good hotel - new, modern, efficient, clean, convenient - all I want for a business trip. Note - this is not in downtown city centre. The rooms are smaller compared to other established well-known hotels but the space is enough for me to move around in, well-lit, has all the paraphenalia I need.There are lots of places nearby to eat at if you don't want to eat in. Across the road, to the left, about a 15-minute walk is Carrefour supermarket. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Lots of Problems in Hotel Hotel hardware is fine. I like the rooms although they are a bit small. Location is good and close to shopping and other restaurants in the Changning district of Shanghai. The other parts of hotel though are below par for a five star hotel.I came with a delegation of seven people. And all of us agreed we will not come back to the hotel again. Firstly three out of seven of us have problems with the key card. It is painful to haul your luggage upstairs only to discover that the key does not work. Two of my delegation members had to do it twice!For a business hotel the elevators are not enough to service all the guests coming down in the mornings. There is a long wait and the elevators are quite full. Breakfast involves lining up to give your numbers. The waitresses and hotel staff all look frazzled and stressed to cope with the crowd. Checking out and checking in all involved long queues. One thing I hate about hotels in China is they need to check your room (to make sure you did not run away with bathrobes or remote controls) before they let you go. This hotel just takes a longer time.In China many hotels do not charge for Internet access. This one does at 120 chinese yuan (US$15) per night. And it is slow. The theme in this hotel seems to be the guests have to spend a long time waiting for anything. For checking in, for Internet, for food etc.All in all not worth the money one pays for. There are many better choices elsewhere in Shanghai. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Great location good value! My Shanghai friends arranged this Hotel as it was near their offices etc. Close to subway ,breakfast was excellent and the bed comfortable.Staff friendly and efficient and the bar was very nice. Definitely stay there again in April.Very good value for money as I have stayed in Shanghai many times and the price can be high. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Just fantastic - absolutely fantastic I had worried before my arrival in Shanghai, it was cold and very unwelcoming as we stepped out of the airport, having been in Bejing a few years ago I was starting to get concerned.Having arrived at the hotel I knew it was going to be good, directed up to the executive floor I checked in over a coffee and the attentive staff had the process all done and we were off to our room on the 35th floor.As part of the excutive floors, the room is very spacious and well equipped, with a separate lounge/office separate bedroom and excellent bathroom with a wetroom featuring a great shower!There are staff everywhere, the place is spotless, you put something in the ashtray and its gone when you go back a minute later.The executive breakfast and free all-day bar is fantastic too, along with the breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner if you stayed there all day you could eat for free!Well worth the stay, having paid 850RMB a night on a special corporate rate with internet included its going to be a long while before I am in a hotel this good again.... "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Excellent Shanghai Hotel This was a great 5 star hotel in Shanghai. The lobby was beautiful and welcoming. It even had a piano player and singer in the lobby lounge in the evenings.Check-in and out was fast and easy. The rooms were nice and bright. Beds were soft (unlike a lot of China hotels).Not sure about the location because we took tour buses and cabs everywhere, but I think its very close to the subway if you're getting around on your own. There's plenty of shops nearby to get your essentials.Overall a great place to stay in Shanghai. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel! We stayed at the Mayfair Hotel for 12 nights in October for Special Olympics. The breakfast buffet was wonderful, even after 12 days. We also enjoyed the dinner buffet a couple of evenings and that was wonderful as well. We had a view of the park across the street. This hotel is in a great location, the subway stop is a 5 minute walk, you don't even need to cross a street! Service overall was excellent. The rooms were very clean. The concierges were very helpful. We would stay again, and would definitely recommend this hotel! "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Really comfortable hotel - such a pleasant stay My husband and I stayed at the Mayfair for 3 nights as part of an organized Grand Prix trip with the Travel Department. On booking, we requested an upgrade to the Executive Suites. The additional cost was approximately €50 per night and it was well worth the extra money. Highlights:-The suites were beautifully appointed with separate living area, bedroom, vanity area and bathroom. There we sliding door separating the different rooms and the décor was fresh and modern. -The bathroom was a little small, but pretty impressive. It was marble, with separate bath and big shower. The water pressure for the shower was great (nearly take your skin off at full pressure!!). There was also a wall mounted TV in there!! Great selection of toiletries available including tooth brush kit, loofah, gels, shampoos, vanity kit etc. Bottles of water provided each day for oral hygiene etc. -The bed was a little hard, but comfortable none the less and the size was great. Comfortable duvet and pillows also provided. Bathrobe and slippers also provided.-The room was fully air-conditioned which was a God sent as the humidity in Shanghai can be a little unbearable (it was 30 degrees and 80% humidity during our trip). -Mini bar was well stocked and was replenished daily. Prices were what you would expect from a hotel – but not extortionate. -As we had upgraded to the executive package we were situation on the executive floor. This was the 35th floor which had amazing views out over the city (the night lights were a picture to behold). We also had access to the executive lounge which meant free drink (good national brand available), your own dining area for breakfast and your own reception area which was manned all the time (very convenient for a speedy check out). The staff were super efficient in this area. -Ironing board and iron in room. Also a very efficient laundry service available for dry cleaning and regular laundry. -Very and efficient staff throughout our experience. -Impressive and beautiful lobby and lounge areas. Grand piano surrounded by a water feature with a pianist playing nightly – very relaxing. Lifts are also really impressive being all marble, mirrors and brass. A staff member was there almost all the time simply cleaning them down and shining them up. Flowers placed in the cigarette bins making them less unsightly. Low lights:-I really can’t think of any!! This is a relatively new hotel and it shows. Some travelers have mentioned that it is a little out of the way which is true, however, taxis are so cheap, the most we ever spent was the equivalent of €3.00 and the average was about €2. Tip:Visit M on the Bund – really great restaurant. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"The Mayfair's fab! Great property, views, ammenities, staff, breakfast - and an outdoor pool on the 15th floor - with park views - to beat the stifling Shanghai summer! Only downfall is the location: not on metro line or super close to attractions. However taxi's are always available and very inexpensive. Highly recommended. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Kind of Disappointing I had booked through the hotel, and had asked for a queen bed in the room, and non-smoking. I realize these things are not guaranteed, but I found out (after a 20-minute wait at check-in, with heavy luggage, which no-one had bothered to relieve me of) that this was not available. Later, as I tried to sleep in the twin bed provided, I realized that the hotel must have been really just deisgned for Chinese people, because I am 6' 3'' and my feet stuck out off the bed by at least a few inches, even though I was sleeping diagonally. My room seemed small - positively liliputian, actually, particularly the bathroom with was very cramped with lots of sharp corners.The internet charges at over 100RMB per day were also amongst the highest I've experienced in China. Overall, I found it to be a really rather disappointing experience, especially after all the positive comments here. I travel a lot in China and especially in Shanghai, and I know for a fact you can do a lot better for your money. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"They have a 4 Star and 5 Star Tower The hotel is not central to the city but I knew this on booking. It is located in an area with heaps of shops and restaurants and right next door to Zhongshan Station, which makes it so easy to get into the sights. The negative of this hotel is that they have 2 towers, one is 4 star and the other a 5 star tower. The receptionist informs you of this upon checkin and tries to upsell these rooms 300yuan($50). I had no idea my room was not going to have a minibar and rock hard beds. Be aware when booking that you have booked a room with these standard requirements. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Comfortable convenient and just one small step off the beaten path Comfortable, convenient, especially if you want to be just a bit away from the &quot;usual suspects&quot; hotels and tourist ghettos. Exceptional value for the yuan/dollar spent. Mayfair is immediately adjacent to one subway line and just a short walk from two other lines, making travel around Shanghai a breeze. Nice shopping, many very good restaurants in all price ranges, several Starbucks in the immediate area. Easy to get a taxi at the hotel. Very capable staff was patient with my broken Chinese or, at my alternative, very fluent in English.I myself like to stay just a little away from the center of cities so as to get a better feel for the everyday. Yet I always want to be able to get to the main tourist sites with virtually no extra effort. The Mayfair was perfect for me in this regard. Clean, quiet, spiffy, not obscenely luxurious, but quite comfortable and &quot;new&quot; feeling. It's a long way from Pudong airport, but worth the few extra dollars you spend to get there. I was there in early Springtime, so did not see the rooftop outdoor pool, but imagine that, when that is open, this hotel becomes absolutely unbeatable as a combination of price, convenience and comfort, as long as you do not mind using taxis (which are very inexpensive) or using the subway (which, being brand new, there is no reason to mind it). "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Fair Deal at the Mayfair Definitely workable for the Western business traveler, as the accommodations in Shanghai keep getting better and better. I remember just a few years ago when the staff at the Peace Hotel could barely pronounce the places's English name. Your Mayfair staff are miles beyond this, though of course once in a while you need to be patient, as they are.That said, this is a great hotel because you're out of the worst of the expat exploitation zone and can get some real Chinese food! Also close to the domestic airport and Zhongshan Park is a nice way to forget the urban hell that is Shanghai.Service at the hotel is prompt, attentive, and accurate. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Really good hotel We stayed here for 7 nights at the beginning of October and were really pleased with the place. Our room was high up and had a great view over the surrounding area. It was clean, friendly and efficient and offered a variety of places to eat and drink, although the main bar was shut most of the time as it was during the National Day holiday week. We had the buffet on a couple of nights and you can get a good mix of local and western food and unlimited free beer! (Well, included in the price as long as you were eating) We chose this hotel mainly because it had an outdoor swimming pool on the 15th floor. But although it was warm enough weather to swim, it was too windy and cool up there to relax. There were some young teenagers who were braver than me who were enjoying a swim. Pleasant spot though and fantasic views across the park and the rest of the city from there, expecially at night.There's not much to do locally ( or we didn't find anything) but Zhongshan Park was good to walk around and big enough to while away a couple of hours.It's quite close to the metro at Zhongshan Park (about 10minutes) and that is only 3 stops from Peoples Square, so a good location for access to the city centre.I'll be putting a review of the whole trip on the Shanghai page. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"good value for 4-5 star hotel Owned or managed by New World Group (Hong Kong) so the service is catered to the Western traveler. Seemed to have quite a few Hong Kong tour groups, shopping for the weekend. Quick check in with friendly staff. I requested Non Smoking - King bed and was accomodated without any problems. Agree with previous review that far too many smoking rooms in Chinese hotels. Room was clean &amp; quiet, and housekeeping staff was very accomodating, they helped me get laundry done after I missed the cutoff for the day.Coffee service is provided in lobby in the morning, or there is a starbucks around the corner.To sum up, great value ($1000RMB) for a well western managed hotel. I have stayed at other 5 Stars in Shanghai before that are a little nicer, but they are also double the price. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Good Services I asked some of my local Shanghainese friends then choose this one; we arrived very late, however when we got there, packed of asian people smoking in the lobby...; just while i felt really bad about this hotel, the checking process is really fast, all the staff is really helpful and spoke in fluent English, plus a really friendly Caucasion staff, we are surprised.The hotel looks like a typical asian apartment, not really tastful, but its clean and worth what its for.Plus for the great buffet for breakfast.Subway is nearby, however have to take taxi, its cheap and easy to get around, but be aware when its raining, there is NO WAY you can catch any taxi!! "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Pretty Good! The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. There's a direct access to the subway from the lobby although we didn't use it coz it seemed that taking a cab was more convenient (about RMB15 to 25 on the average to the main shopping centers). The hotel itself is a bit out of the way - a couple of malls nearby but the stuff on stock are so-so, and there's a small factory outlet of nike, adidas and other sports brands. There's a restaurant right in the hotel's lobby (a tenant, I suppose) - Today and Tomorrow - that serves really good chinese food...price is affordable (arnd USD5-10 per dish) and ambiance is clean and nice. Across the street from this restaurant is a dimsum fast food restaurant. The attendants there don't speak much english but you can just point to the pictures and indicate how many plates you want of that - 1 dimsum platter good for 1 or 2 is about 4RMB (around USD0.50!) and the flavor is great - eat it with some chinese vinegar! Yum! This place gets full during meal time. Beside the dimsum place is a 7-11 type of convenience store.Be careful when crossing the street. Even if the road may be one way for cars, there are roads that remain 2 ways for motorcycles and bicycles. Look both ways several times, even when you're already crossing!I recommend this hotel although you might be able to get a hotel with a better location. Otherwise, if you just need a place to sleep that isn't too pricey and has access to restaurants, this is the place to book. "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Bad Service! DON'T GO! We were there from April 21st, 2006 to April 23rd, 2006. I bought a voucher from a travelling agent in Hong Kong (meaning that I had paid for the room already). They held RMB $ 5,000 on my credit card and 'till this day (today is April 26th), the amount was still being held.I called them once two days ago and the guy whom I was talking to admitted that they made a mistake by holding us RMB $5,000. We had a voucher and we didn't need to have a credit card on file and they shouldn't hold that amount. He agreed to call the bank to release the amount, but still haven't done it yet. I was only staying in a standard room for two nites and why on earth did they hold that much money? I called again today and they directed my line to the health club! What da hell was going on with these people?! Because the health club people couldn't direct my line back to the front desk...I had to call long distance to the front desk again.... and I am still waiting for their call back and the problem was still not yet solved.I called my bank and asked them how long will the money be on hold, they said probably for 3 weeks if the hotel has no intention of releasing it. You know for travellers, they really need extra money on their credit card. It was their mistakes on having to hold that much money, and they didn't make an effort to release the money. How ridiculous was that.I will definately not stay there again. Service was bad. People were clueless.... "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"Pretty good. Stayed here, early september, all and all a good hotel - wasnt sure what to expect never travelled to china before - Hotel was modern, and they state 5 star but probbably more like 4 - 4 1/2 but still very good - Seemed to be popular with flight crew which i guess is a recommendation. Staff are very friendly and helpful and most speak english and they have english only speakers at the reception which is nice. Rooms on the front have good views of the skyline and park across the road aswell as an large entertaining chinese ( chaotic ) intersection - Lunch and breakfast in hotel everyday was high standard with a large selection - dinner they had a malaysian festival with food and entertainment which was fun and good ( but really you dont want to eat dinner in the hotel - thats no fun so we didnt any other night) All and all a good stay - i recommend it . The previous comments are all valid as well - although it is off the beaten path - taxis are more than plentiful and dirt cheap - $3-4US at the *most* to most destinations and the city - and well worth the thrill ride :) "
mayfair hotel shanghai ,"A bit off the beaten track i stayed at the mayfair hotel just last month. Definately suggest to book a non smoking room as they seem to have an over abundance of smoking rooms. At reception they tried to railroad me into a smoking room which could have a 'nonsmoking&quot; treatment done to it. no idea what they thought they could do to a room that had a heavy smoke smell in all the soft furnishings! after inspecting the room i returned to reception to try to negotiate my way into a real non smoking room. Otherwise everything good. as is usual in big hotels, breakfast rather overpriced. Bakery next door was nice. Train station alongside hotel and huge park across the road. Small take away food shop in the 'old' section of the hotel (left up ramp from reception) that sold sandwichs, biscuits and chocolates. 10% off after 6pm. Mcdonalds across the road. Other wise a nice hotel. "

millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Solid Business Hotel - Excellent rooms firm beds This is a very solid business hotel. The beds are nice and firm unlike the soft mattresses in the states that are murder on my back. Rooms are very well appointed in terms of lighting, bathroom, and supplies.Service is good if a bit on the cold side.Breakfast, which was included w/ our rooms, was good but by no means the best I have experienced in Asia.Location is close to Shanghai Mart - within walking distance if you dare to deal with crossing the street "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,Great learning venue This hotel was fabulous. The accommodation rooms were beautiful...very beautiful.. you could watch TV from the bath if you didn't have jet lag so much that you couldn't have a bath. ..The conference rooms were also very good for breakout rooms and large roromos - the staff were wonderful. 
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Clean and Quite Great Hotel, Location is Key for me since i need to be in that Area.... The Gym is small but good and Quite, the Pool is very nice big and clean and the locker roms where very nice showers.... the room is great except for the bed which is as hard as a rock but otherwise sheets and conforters were excellent..... NO nightlife at all.... it has a club with great music and 2 workers but NO customers ever.... There is a Piano BAr which is also very silent..... "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Awesome Garden This, it has to be said is one of the best hotels that i've ever stayed in Shanghai. The view of the garden when you first arrive is magnificant. The rooms were beyond luxurious and was surely among the largest in this city. It has the most amazing pool. The staff were curtious and friendly and I felt very welcomed. The food was delicious. The hotel was just amazing and made the stay one of the best that we've ever had in Shanghai. Definately recommend this to anyone. 5 Star. It would be more ideal if there would be a BBQ party with beers in such a stunning gorgeous garden! "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,If this hotel were in a better location! As good as any hotel needs to be and the value was the best we experienced on our trip. . We were upgraded to a suite and the room and hotel were superb. The service was excellent and the staff more accommodating than we are used to having. The hotel is about a 30 minute taxi ride (only $5 cost) from the center of Shanghai and that was the only issue because there always seems to be bumper to bumper traffic on the road between the two places. 
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Eerily quiet but nice To follow the other reviews, the location is odd (and some cabs had trouble finding it, even with the location card). The staff was English-friendly and helpful but there were some glitches.The room was large and I had a garden view, which is preferable to the highway view. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was very nice.But the whole place was strangely quiet. Hardly ever saw another soul. The attractive health club was virtually empty, except for chatting staff members, which was weird and I left earlier than I would have wanted to. Business center only had 2 internet stations and I had to wait 20 minutes to use it one time. But they offered tea or juice while I waited. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,Great Staff! Love it ! email me if u wanna know more .. only downside is the location .. it's away from the main attractions.. but nothing a pretty reasonable cab ride wouldn't solve . If its just some food and a little bit of shopping u're looking for .. fear not... theres a huge carrefour just beside the hotel ... with fast food and a food court as well .. GREAT PLACE!!! 
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Excellent hotel I was in Shanghai for two days, my last two days in China and what a way to end my journey!A superb hotel!The only not so positive aspect was the location, but with all the good aspects, I can easily forget this one! You can pick a taxi and in 20minutes you're in the center! Don't worry :)Where can I start? Beautiful rooms, with everything you may need when you are in a hotel, with very modern and clean decoration!The staff really can speak english and not just say a words like all the others hotels that I stayed in China! You easily figure that the staff has formation in english and here you don't see young boys and girls working....finally some adults working here!The breakfast was superb with a big room with lots of different food!I sure would comeback to this hotel if I ever came to Shanghai again...hope so :) "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Fantastic I can't add much to the previous reviews. This is a superb Hotel. Everything was perfect. So many lovely staff and all dressed so neatly. My room was great although be warned the bathroom has a window straight through to the bedroom. Some might not like this. As I was by myself on business it didn't worry me.Great place to stay if you want to be in the area for some reason. If I was visiting for tourism I would stay in the city.Also as previously mentioned, the Carrefour shopping complex is only a short walk. I ate in the food court a few times to get away from the hotel food. It was quite OK and the menus had English. Lots of variety and very cheap about 50 - 60 RMB with a beer.If you want some cheap clothes, watches, bags etc then the Pearl City shopping centre is about a 20 min walk further. As in a lot of places in China you have to negotiate the price down. Its great fun but play hard as they are very good at it. A good rule of thumb is to never pay anymore than half of what they initially ask, and it is always better to go down even further. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"A good hotel Hunked down for a full week in this hotel on a corporate training course, my conclusion is:PLUS:Excellent facilities. An extremely sweet , service-minded and accommodating staff above international average. &quot;OK&quot; food (choice is very good, quality is rather average (no WOW factor - but noodle station is great); modern, pleasant and spacious rooms with all executive needs; walking distance to Pearl Market and Carrefour shopping mall and food court.Good conference facilities with excellent service and catering. Nice surrounding gardens for breaks. The Bund is a 20-30 minute taxi ride away.MINUS:The beds are hard!Internet is slow. Not the hotel's fault - you feel like 25 people are at all times checking each page you visit....The buffet varies little, Shanghai style cousine which may for many westerners be a challenge as all meat dishes are &quot;bones and fat&quot; included. There are however always good alternatives a la carte. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Business in Shanghai Area This is a beautiful hotel, and an oasis for people who have little to no Chinese ability. It is staffed with impeccably dressed and polite staff. After a few days of getting to know the staff, I asked an employee who had very fluent English how she managed to speak so comfortably. She told me the hotel staffed many students currently studying English as part of their business curriculum in nearby universities. These positions were like internships that gave them the chance to practice their conversational English. What luck for me! My Mandarin is BARELY usable. Hongqiao (&quot;hong-chow&quot;) is an area outside of the incredibly congested Shanghai. If you are looking for Shanghai tourism, stay closer to the Bund. If you need to get somewhere outside of the city, stay here so you don't have to fight traffic leaving/returning to the city. The most convenient thing about this hotel is that it is immediately next to a 7-story food/shopping complex. Plenty of prepared food can be found in the lower level &quot;food court&quot;; and groceries, clothing, toiletries, liquor, and souveniers are abundant. Just don't look for English speakers in the shopping complex. The only issue I had when there, was my travel agent was quoted a different price (by a LOT), and there wasn't anyone there willing to discuss how this happened, nor able to give me the price quoted. We were unable to compromise, and I ended up agreeing to paying about $100 USD per night more than planned, so check your price on the paperwork when checking in! This hotel was WAY EXPENSIVE for China, but very worth it if you can afford it. Quick warning: If you wander outside, the immediate area is pretty safe, but stay on the street side of the billboards. You are not welcome behind them by the people living in the spaces &quot;painted over&quot; by the city! "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Good Experience! Stayed one night at the Millenium-Very nice hotel, modern decor, and clean. Most of the staff spoke english, which is always nice.Breakfast was included with my rate and I had the buffet. It was pretty good and had a fairly wide selection of items. I was surprised to see a putting green outside my window. I didn't get a chance to use it or see pool or gym.I stayed here for business, but it was within walking distance to shopping. Carrefour was next door.The hotel is pretty far south of the Bund and the Pudong area (tv tower), but if I recall correctly the hotel has a shuttle to those areas. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"I would Highly reccommend this to any traveller. I stayed at this Hotel with 2 of my girlfriends,we had adjoining rooms that were spacious clean and very modern with a view of the surrounding city from a ceiling to floor windows. Our checkin/checkout was seemless. Cost was @ $800AUD including fantastic buffet breakfast for 6 days. Great value! The nearby supermarket was handy for ATM and personal items. Here in Shanghai you must be prepared to catch cabs form A-B .This is not an expensive way to travel but is the easiest way to get around, public transport is too complicated. Getting taxis from our Hotel was no trouble, peak hour traffic is a nightmare, which is practically 24.7. There is no catering for tourism in any of the Hotels in Shanghai. You must go with a clear idea of what you want to do and where you want to go. No brochures appear in the foyer of any of the Hotels. The staff of our Hotel were very helpful in directing us and in turn telling our cab drivers were to take us in there language. Always carry a card from the Hotel where you are staying that has the mud map of where you are to be returned to! A lot of the taxi drivers are illiterate so make sure they absolutely know where they are to take you. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Good place to stay Good hotel to stay in Shanghai. Only thing is it is bit difficult to get a cab from the hotel, cab drivers don't come in too often, we had to walk to near by intersection to wave down a cab, lot more cabs at the near by intersection. Overall, it is a great hotel. "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Good Just stayed there while on biz trip last week. Got a very good rate, about 800 RMBThe hotel is located in Hong Qiao, an expat area. It's just beside a Carrefour and shopping centre, so convenient if you want to do a bit of shopping. But it's situated quite a distance from Xintiandi, the Bund, Huaihai Rd and the central shopping areas. But I was travelling out of Shanghai, so the location was convenient since I would avoid the traffic in the business districtThe hotel is new, just opened in Oct 2006 according to the hotel staff. Lobby is rather grand, with 3 restaurants. Only tried the chinese restaurant and it's not bad. Less oily and salty than some of the other chinese restaurants I tried in China. Food in the hotel is quite highly priced. Was upgraded to a club room. The room is quite big and well furnished. The sockets on the desk has a multi-adapter, so convenient for travellers who need to use laptop or charge phone. bed's comfy and the bathroom is nice too. It was a rather nice stay and I would stay there again "
millennium hongqiao hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel just a little out of the action This is a great hotel in many ways, the rooms are large and up to the minute with flatscreen TVs, superb bathrooms with monsoon shower heads and comfy beds plus there are an impressive aray of dining choices and a decent gym. While the staff dont speak flawless English, they make up for it by being very customer service focused and enthusiastic and proud of their hotel. On the cons side, its just far away from the Shanghai action, a good 30 min taxi ride from the Bund/French Concession etc and while that will not set you back more than 35 yuan it makes taking an impulsive stroll somewhat more difficult. That said if you want to be near Hongqiao airport or the expat districts, this is a good bet. It might also come in handy as a back stop when Shanghai's big 5star names fill up in the popular months "

motel 168 shanghai pudong airport ,"Great if you have an early flight to catch I stayed at this hotel for one night as I was in transit in Shanghai. The hotel is ideally located at the airport, in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, just above the Maglev station. My room was nice and clean. The only downside was the fact that as my room was next to the lift, I could hear people shouting (literally) outside of my front door, so did not get much sleep at all. I wasn't the hotel's fault, as it was just down to some inconsiderate guests.Reception staff were polite and friendly. "
motel 168 shanghai pudong airport ,"Nice room great value The location is ideal - between the two terminals, so easy walking distance, quiet. Ideal if you have a late arrival or early departure. Spacious, clean, modern room, free wired Internet. Great view of terminal, planes taking off and landing. Price 338RMB on English language website, 298RMB on Chinese language site or at check in. Dinner (RMB 38) and breakfast (RMB 20) buffets Chinese oriented, but some western food. Down the elevator to food court (Kung Fu, KFC, Pizza Hut). I will be a regular, as Northwest flights arrive late/leave fairly early.Check in and check out were fast by Chinese standards - minimal lines, fast service. But be ready to have them check the room when you want to check out, as all Chinese hotels I've stayed in do. "
motel 168 shanghai pudong airport ,"Convenience This is a good hotel if your flight has been canceled or changed as it sits between the two terminals of the Shanghai airport. It's a good value at about $50, includes breakfast, comfortable rooms, flat screen tv and free internet for your laptop. The decor is a bit gaudy as they try to be hip, but you'll live through it. It's surprisingly quiet given it's location at the airport. If you don't feel like getting into town, you can eat at several fast food outlets as well as the airport restaurants ( tasty and good values), The transit visa is also good for 24hours so you can shoot into Shanghai on the Magdev, a super fast bullet train that will have you in downtown Shanghai in 7 minutes! "
motel 168 shanghai pudong airport ,"Good value though let down by 2 big issues This is an airport hotel situated right inside Shanghai Pudong Airport. The lift takes you up to the hotel, and down directly to the two terminals. It is therefore extremely convenient for Pudong Airport.For 298 RMB (about £28) I was not expecting much but the hotel is suprisingly modern and comfortable. The hotel itself is split into two parts - the Ease Hotel and Motel 168. My room was in the latter, with the former being more up class and probably more expensive.The room was of a good size and overlooked one of the terminals. It was also surprisingly quiet considering its location. The furniture and build was all very new and the shower room was large and modern also, all well designed. Soft carpeting and furnishings though the bed was hard and the pillows were of low quality. There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall, though Chinese channels only and a work desk. Great plus point is free internet, including use of an ethernet cable.However, this decent hotel was let down by two annoying issues. The first was that the water in the bathroom was only luke warm at most. The second was that at 11pm they decided to carry out some work to the rooms above subjecting me to constant loud banging noise until 4am. As I had to get up at 6am for a flight, I did not get any sleep which kind of defeated the whole object of being there.The room service menu looked bad and expensive though the 38RMB dinner buffet was good value (the restaurant is at the Ease Hotel). Some of the translation is also amusing.If they increase the water temperature and prevent the noise (which is hardly difficult to do), this would have got a 5 star from me. Therefore, my summary is that if you need to stay at Pudong Aiport, this is a &quot;good&quot; choice considering the price, location and facilities. "

nanjing hotel ,Nanjing Hotel Very convienent location. Nothing flash but clean and had everything you needed. I wouldn't bother with the breakfast. 
nanjing hotel ,"Happy Nanjing! What an easy and pleasant introduction to Shanghai! For starters, this hotel is SIMPLE to get to from the airport - take the Maglev Express train to the terminus, transfer to the Metro Line 2, 6 stops to Nanjing Road EAST, out exit 1, turn right, walk less than 1 minute and voila! Nanjing Hotel. (The express train costs 50 and the metro ride costs 6 and could not be easier to navigate.)For 3 nights the location was ideal, central to everything. If you are feeling ambitious, at 7am you can walk up Nanjing Road to the People's Square and see all the morning buzz of exercisers and dancers. What a treat! The hotel itself has a quaint charm to it, I love this type of place! Like the reviewer below I was also on the 8th floor, in 801 which is a corner room, also at the end of the corridor, about TWICE as big as other rooms in the hotel, and 2 windows for a nice airy and breezy draft. I only mention that because, effective October 7, the hotel has dismantled its AC for the winter season. Great for the environment, not so great if you like a bit of air in your quarters. :) Problem solved, just ask (nicely) for a fan for the room,As for all the commentary regarding the front desk staff, I live in Asia and found the staff to be patient, accommodating, and helpful. ALL OF THEM. From the moment I walked in the hotel there was an issue with my Expedia booking that they quickly resolved. I was given a choice of rooms. I was provided a fan for my room, travel advice, restaurant advice, shopping advice, and even a hair dryer on request! I think if as a guest in China you take your time and communicate slowly you in your language, you will be met with a courteous and helpful response. As for the bedding, some reviewers complained and yes the bed IS firm but I LOVE it!! (I'd sleep on the floor if I could, hello tatami mat and futon!) If noise is an issue you'll definitely want to be on the back side of the hotel although I was on the front side and the noise completely dies down by evening. I am generally a light-ish sleeper and had no problem. Actually I thought the room and corridor were super quiet (not even sure there were any other guests during my stay- it was THAT quiet) In room broadband internet is available for .10 a mn or 20 a day, fairly reliable altho did time-out every couple of hours and the government has a ban on F@cebook, Tw1tter and Pic@sa currently in place, fyi. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Also, I highly recommend the sichuan restaurant (told to me by the Front Desk staff hehe) around the corner (try the chicken with peanuts YUMMMM, 28!) and also the Brick Coffee takeaway stand for a delicious Iced Pearl or Milk Tea Coffee (6 and 10 respectively). See photos attached. :) "
nanjing hotel ,"a great find having hunted through trip advisor for shanghai hotels i went for the Nanjing.The location really is great- 50 metres from shanghai's super shopping street, 70 metres from the Nanjing rd East metro station and right opposite 3 or 4 really good cheap restaurantsif you're concerned about any road noise at night, ask for a room whose number ends between 10 and 17.BTW a few people have said the front desk people are rude-i didn't find that- they were a bit cold but hey, how long do you want to spend at the front desk when you're in shanghai "
nanjing hotel ,Good location 50 m to pedestrian street metro My 8 night stay was especially pleasant in corner room 820 at the end of the corridor with no passing guests. The wide single beds were very comfortable. Didn't open the windows because it was hot &amp; steamy outside &amp; of course there's noise from the car &amp; motor bike horns. The step up into the bathroom was most interesting &amp; sometimes the shower took time to warm up but worth the wait to be refreshed. Didn't think the buffet breakfast for Yuan 30 worth the money (lots of food choices outside on the stalls &amp; in cafes). The restaurant menu is adequate. Room cleaning was good. Post box outside hotel &amp; PO a few blocks away has a philatelic counter. The police station is a few doors from hotel so lots of men in uniform ! English language channel is CCTV9. Walk the back streets &amp; see a very different world from the one on Nanjing Lu. Get up early to see the tai chi &amp; badminton &amp; people watch. 
nanjing hotel ,"Extremely Rude Front Desk Staff The previous reviewers are correct. The hotel is in a great location, right next to the pedestrian mall. The carpet is dirty, the bedding was questionnable, the bathroom is dimly lit, has a strange step up, had lots of mold and half of the showers were cold.The windows are really thin, and the noise is unreal - if you are a light sleeper, do not stay here! The worst part of this hotel is the unbelieveably rude front desk staff.When we asked for directions to a local coffee spot (Starbucks) they pretended to notunderstand. When my white son spoke Mandarin to them (he is currently attending a University in China and met us for the trip), they refused to listen to him. Finally, one ofthe rudies said to go buy a map in the gift shop...they didn't have one map at the front desk! I will never stay here again, or recommend this hotel. There are other places that are just as handy with nice, helpful, staff! "
nanjing hotel ,"basic hotel clean good location People at reception speak english, better than in other places i stayed.Shower has little water pressure.Nothing else to say. Basic.Super location, as good as on nanjing road. Walking distance from the Bund or the People's Square. "
nanjing hotel ,"Do they hate their job that much? State of carpet and hardness of bed was no different to any other hotel we stayed in, in China , BUT the impression you get is that the staff absolutely hate their job and absolutely hate customers!! One big advantage is it's location - close to metro which is great. Close to The Bund - but that's a mess at the moment and will be for some weeks yet I would expect. Great street stalls for breakfast etc - go out door, turn right and both the next street and second street over have plenty of street stalls. Yum. "
nanjing hotel ,"great value convenient location For the rate we got we did not expect the Hilton, which we did not get of course. But we got an absolutely fine room, which was clean and well looked after in a hotel with a great location near the shopping street in walking distance from the Bund (which is of course currently a big construction venue for the Expo 2010) and only a few meters away from the metro station. Did not try the food there as our rate did not incl. any breakfast. Lots of small Chinese restaurants in that street though. Overall a great value for money deal and a completely satisfied stay. Service attitude at the reception was very different, depending from which staff was catering you. One was great, two others not. But we had no probs at all. Would definitely return. "
nanjing hotel ,"Unbelieveable value and location I swapped to this hotel from my hostel further from the centre. I couldn't believe that such an affordable hotel could be right in the centre of the action. It was great to wander along Nanjing Donglu at night, and then just fall into bed. It's especially good for solo travellers like me, who don't really want to be walking a long way to get back to their accommodation at night.The room was fine...clean and comfortable. Some of the staff were a bit surly, but for 300Y a night, this place was fantastic. "
nanjing hotel ,"Decent Hotel Great Location I will just agree with what previous posters said. The hotel is fine - clean enough, standard REALLY hard bed, decent size room. The location is EXCELLENT making it the perfect place to stay when we only had one night to do some sightseeing.The only negative thing I found was that the lighting in the bathroom was terrible and they didn't have any maps of Shanghai available to us. "
nanjing hotel ,"Great Hotel : ) One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location, right on NanJing road and with easy access to the underground station and the 'newer' parts of Shanghai. The hotel itself was very nice, big, clean rooms. One thing that was slightly strange is that when we were standing in the bathrooms in the rooms everyone felt dizzy!! (we were a big group and nearly everyone mentioned it!!) maybe it was just us. The staff we also very polite and helpful. "
nanjing hotel ,Good location and price. Bad hotel The price is good for the location. The room is not too clean and small. I won't stay there again. 
nanjing hotel ,"Best hotel in Shanghai by location and price range! As other reviewers say, it is truly right off on Nanjing Lu. This is nice considering that this is a tourist hub. The subway stop is also at the corner which makes for a quick route to the MagLev train (to Pudong airport).There is a c-store across the street which I believe is 24 hours which is handy for snacks and water. If you're looking for a nice Americanized breakfast and free wifi, walk up Nanjing Lu toward People Square and stop in at the Costa's. I don't know if Nanjing Hotel had internet because I only had my iPhone with me.The rooms are nice. Booked on ctrip.com for around $40 - $45 a night. They are clean and comfortable. No complaints, except that the shower head's spray was a bit strong (normally a good thing, but there was no other setting). Also, my tub clogged up a bit so I would stand in water while I showered. A minor thing for me, I didn't bother to complain. The beds are standard hardness but China standards. So if you are used to that or know what that means you won't be surprised. If you're not used to it, you'll probably need to adjust to the firmness, unless you're staying at higher priced hotels.Note that the windows do open and the air conditioning works nicely. The rooms on the front side of the building have a balcony which is a treat.The TV only has Chinese channels -- but we were not there to watch TV. Our unit also had a fridge with mini-bar items, but we kept our waters and stuff in there. We also had a safe in the room that was opened by our key card. The room also come with a hot water maker and complimentary tea.The staff is helpful and nice and speak good english. The breakfast spread at the restaurant was only okay. I did not go back as there are many options in the area.Safety: There is some kind of police station or bureau next door to Nanjing Hotel. And though the area didn't feel seedy (being right off Nanjing Lu), it never hurts to see that.One last thing about this hotel. When you walk into the room you get a nice clean smell. None of that musty old hotel funk. For me, that is the moment of truth when entering a new room. Nanjing passed the smell test on the 2 different rooms I stayed in. If my budget is same, I definitely would stay here again. Hope these details help! "
nanjing hotel ,"Great location! Stayed in this hotel as part of a GAP tour and loved the location. Literally a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road and even walking distance to the Bund and People's Square. Also, very close to the subway. Plenty of restaurants in the area (Western and Chinese) and lots of corner stores to buy things like water and snacks (there is also a fridge also in the room to use). The hotel seems pretty old but still fairly clean with friendly English speaking staff. Balcony was also a pleasant surprise and it was nice to lean over the balcony and take in all the sights, sounds and smells of the busy street below. I highly enjoyed my stay!! "
nanjing hotel ,"One of the best locations ever I LOVED this hotel! It was everything you needed with a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road. I don't think you could get a better location. It was a relatively short walk to the Bund and is walkable to the Yuyuen Gardens and Bazaar.It was roomy and comfortable and had been completely renovated, although I did change rooms mid-stay and inherited a bed which made concrete seem cosy, but otherwise it was great! The first bed was good, the second will remain burned in my memory forever.There are hawkers outside who try to entice you into bad restaurants there, but just ignore them and find a quality restaurant of 90 which can be as little as 30 metres past these people. Also watch out for mad motorbike riders as you step out the front door. They stop for NO ONE!The supermarket opposite is cheap as chips and is good for getting change for the train which is 1/2 block away.The English translations all over the hotel are hillarious particularly in the lifts - I'm not sure who wrote them but make sense they did not :) "
nanjing hotel ,"Excellent location great value very satisfied This hotel is great, the rooms are very clean and comfortable with lots of space, a TV, internet access (with cable), fridge, closet, safe box, and desk. The location could'nt be better, 1 block away from the famous Nanjing Rd. Subway station is 1 block away, very near. There is also a wide selection of restaurants and shops in the area. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. "
nanjing hotel ,"Decent Experience The hotel is in a great location right off of Nanjing Road. It is convenient to get to most of the major sights in Shanghai. The subway stop is less than a minute walk from the hotel. The price of the hotel is also great for the location, but there are some things to mention:Our room 406 had a pretty bad stench that filled up the entire room from one of the restaurants across the street. We informed the staff but unfortunately they said all other rooms were booked. They were well aware of the stench and actually said room 406 was the worst room in the hotel as far as the smell. Upon checkout we mentioned this to the staff again and while they knew about the experience the manager wasn't in and wouldn't be in until the following day and there was nothing they could do about it.Other than the stench, the service was average and the hotel is not a bad one. There are some other hotels right in the area (actually right on Nanjing Road about 2 minutes west of the hotel on the north side that has much cheaper rates (about $5-$10 cheaper) that are available for a cheaper price and same location. All in all it wasn't a bad experience, because of the great price and great location.Not sure I would recommend the place, but if your looking not to spend much money and be central to everything and aren't too concerned about things like &quot;smell&quot;, etc then this may be a good find. "
nanjing hotel ,"Great Location I was looking for a hotel close to Nanjing Road and other amentities without having to pay a fortune. I found the Nanjing Hotel at 200 Shanxi Road. It is one of the Jin Jiang group. I read some reviews and the most often read statement was about &quot;hard beds.&quot; My 18 year old granddaughter thought it the most comfortable bed she had slept on and I agreed, having the best sleeps I have had for a long time. The room was large enough for comfort, very clean and was quiet and we could open the window rather to put up with the noise of an AC going all night. There was hot water at all times, both day and night. Breakfast was Chinese but eggs were available and plenty of toast and what goes with it. There were about four restaurants in the road opposite the hotel, plus a small super market and about one minute's walk took us to busy Nanjing Road with all its shops and restaurants. The staff were all friendly and the majority of them spoke English. All this for 3 nights for about $56 per night for a double! Not bad value!! "
nanjing hotel ,"Location!!! Location is perfect. Only few steps to Nanjing road and metrostation. The room was quite small and the bathroom smelly. There was a fridge, safety box, TV with 70 channels (only one english) and a balcony in the superior room. Average hotel with very reasonable price. "
nanjing hotel ,"A small Oasis of Calm! This was the 1st hotel we stopped in during a small group travel holiday. I was amazed by how many people they had working behind the small reception desk, but I wouldn't say that any of them, whilst not rude, were particularly friendly and welcoming! The rooms were clean, the linen fresh, the bathroom ok, all the important things that don't turn your trip into memorable for all the wrong reasons! The location was great, walking distance to lots of great places with restaurants galore on the doorstep. The hotel must have been peaceful because stepping outside the hotel felt like a constant game of 'chicken'! (Beware the cars, bikes and motorbikes careering up and down the road!) "
nanjing hotel ,"Location location location. I stayed at the Nanjing Hotel twice on my short-stay in China, mostly because of the great location. Subway's just around the corner as well as famous East Nanjing Rd. There's a small Supermarket across the street and a couple of restaurants, as well as fruit and vegetable stands down the road (South Shanxi Rd.)Besides that, rooms aren't too spacious, but okay for a city trip. Both bathrooms I had, were way too small and kind of smelly. But the reception staff were very helpful and friendly. So, service and location are great, the rooms are good for sleeping, but nothing more. "
nanjing hotel ,"Great hotel for location and price The Nanjing was the 1st hotel on my trip across Asia, from Shanghai to Bombay. This turned out to be the best hotel on mytrip. Great location, around the corner from the subway station, ona main pedestrian-only street, (Nanjing Donglu). They had a fastInternet connection for a good price. The bathroom must havebeen a recent remod, and was newer and cleaner than many I'veseen in the U.S. I did try the hotel restaurant once, and it was mediocre. There are fine places to eat next door and across thestreet. I tend to buy water from local vendors, then store it in the mini-fridge. "
nanjing hotel ,"Great option in the heart of Shanghai An aged hotel, probably a luxurious one for business men several years ago. Today, a great hotel for budget tourism.You could see the TV tower and the new SWFC tower from the room window, and other skyscrapers. The room and service are all right. The breakfast is also OK, but bear in mind it's chinese breakfast !It's located close to Nanjing Road, the main commercial street in Shanghai. Besides, you could reach the Nanjing East Road metro station in about 3 minutes !! If you just see a picture of the hotel building and the street at which it's located, you won't be able to imagine all that, becasuse they are old and a little dirty, but the location is great ! "
nanjing hotel ,"Good budget hotel in great location An ok little budget hotel in a great location. Situated just off the main shopping street, 10 mins from The Bund one way and 10mins from the People's Park the other.Rooms were basic and clean if not a little small.Staff were helpful and spoke EnglishSubway station just round the corner. "
nanjing hotel ,"For those who like a city atmosphere Our room was on level 4 but we could hear the noise from the streets quite loudly. The beds were quite firm.The hotel is a few steps away from the Nanjing Road Shopping Mall (part of the road where no cars are allowed), a walking distance to the Bund (which is very crowded at night but surrounded by beautiful lights from the buildings), the Yan'an Rd East tunnel, the pier, and the Silk King (where we got our silk dresses made). It is a short taxi ride to Old Shanghai (which I prefer to be). The service is average and the front desk people understand/ speak little English (it was difficult to find out any information about nearby tourist places). "
nanjing hotel ,"More than expected! I stayed 11 nights in this hotel. To be honest my room was delux room, it was quite big, with good bathroom, fridge, safebox and a good air conditioner.The location is fantastic, very close to pedestrian area in east nanjing road and very close to metro station line 2. Just 10 to 15 minutes walk to the Bund area and even less to people's square.The stuff speaks english, but the breakfast is raelly not worth it.I recommend not to eat there, you will find lots of restaurants around.Inside the hotel is much better than how it looks from outside.I think the price is not very cheap not very expensive! If you look for a budget hotel with some standards, here is the place to be.However, there are quite a few hotels in this area with the same condition.In my opinion west nanjing road may be a better place for those who look for foreign bars and clubs and more fancy stores.Have a pleasant stay!Shahab "
nanjing hotel ,"Good budget hotel We stayed in the Nanjing Hotel last month. It is a good, basic budget hotel, just a few steps from Nanjing Lu. I picked this hotel because it was within walking distance to things we wanted to see, but then we never did any walking. Took taxis everywhere. Due to congestion in front of the hotel, taxi drivers may drop you off the block before. Some taxi drivers had difficulty finding the place, so be sure to take a map of its location with you.Hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff spoke very good English. Breakfast is 30 yuan (approx $5.10US), and changes many items daily. Compared to what we pay in the US for breakfast, it was very good value, but you need to like to eat vegetables for breakfast. Several times we ate food from nearby street vendors, and had breakfasts for 3rmb. We hated Shanghai (much prefer Beijing), but if we ever go back, we would stay there again. "
nanjing hotel ,"Good location The best thing is the location. Otherwise it is a very basic hotel with furniture from the 80´s. Some staff members speak English, but not all. A bit noisy, remember your earplugs. "
nanjing hotel ,"Good location and price Stayed here for 3 nights because we needed a cheap place - we were saving for a more expensive hotel for the end of our holiday. But we were surprised how large the room actually was for the price, and its great location right in the middle of the Nanjing Road. It was a superior twin room, but only cost a few pounds more than the standard one. The room had two single beds, two chairs, small and large table, good lighting, TV (only Chinese stations), and tea making facilities. The safe didn't work though. We had the room at the end of the floor (no.435) , with a balcony looking down on the cross roads below. It was noisy outside until about 1am, but then silent. Except one night when the builders doing up the shop opposite decided to do a bit of hammering at 3am. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was ok. The shower worked well and the towels were small but sufficient. For the price of the room it was a good hotel and we would definitely go back there. "
nanjing hotel ,"Nanjing Hotel good for me. The Nanjing Hotel is an average hotel. The best thing going for it is that it is located less than a city block from the Nanjing Road and a short distance from the Metro. There are several restaurants located in the area and a convenience store located across the street. The rooms are clean and some of the bathrooms have been remodeled. The west side of the hotel has balcony access for the rooms, but it is also the noisiest side of the hotel with all of the traffic on that side. The staff is helpful and can speak English. In all, I would recommend the hotel for any traveler that is on a budget that needs a quiet and clean place to sleep at. "
nanjing hotel ,"Okay hotel in good location We stayed at the Nanjing Hotel from July 21 to 23 as part of a small tour group.This hotel is a very basic one. No hair dryer, no alarm clock, and no safe. But the room was a good size, and was very clean.The location is the best point about this hotel as it is just a few steps away from the central portion of the pedestrian-only zone of Nanjing Road, the major tourist shopping road. It's also near a metro station, which made it easy to get to the Maglev station to go to the Pudong Airport. One note to make is that the glass is single-paned, so it's quite easy to hear the noise outside. I would recommend bringing some ear plugs for a more peaceful sleep.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for budget-conscious travellers who want a good, clean place to stay. "
nanjing hotel ,"Nanjing Hotel can't be beaten for location or value After originally booking just 2 nights at the Nanjing Hotel, we immediately booked another 4 nights as soon as we saw the room as we could see it had everything we wanted for our week in Shanghai and for just 350RMB a night (internet booking), it suited our budgetOur room was a B class (better than A class) with a large bed and the softest matress we have ever had in our 18 months living and working in China. The room was on a corner and very quiet, was very clean, no stains on the carpet, the shower and bathroom was perfect and there was a bar fridge as well as tea making facilities with green tea bags.The Aircon was good and didn't cause a draft but the best thing was the room had windows you can open and good lighting thanks to a down light over the bed, a standard lamp and a desk lamp as well as other ceiling lights. Three occasional chairs, a coffe table, good size wardrobe and bedside tables with drawers made the room seem more like a suite. The TV was modern and large with about 30 channels (although only CCTV9 is in English).We asked for and got a hair dryer, and one night after having left our window open, we had a mosquito but a call to reception got us a mossie zapper.The staff spoke very good English, but the travel agency desk, like most in China, couldn't do much for us.We didn't bother eating in the restuarant (we have never eaten in hotels as its always more fun and cheaper to eat outside) and the little lane outside had about a dozen places to choose from and we had breakfast each day one block down the lane where all the locals would eat on their way to work. As well there are several little convenience stores to grab some beer and chips as well as some good fruit shops all within that same part of the lane.We found lots of local eateries in the small streets that run off Nanjing Lu. Those resturants on Nanjing Lu were very expensive but where the locals eat off the mall are very good value.The location had to be the best part. Just thirty paces off Nanjing Lu which is the main pedestrian shopping mall, with a Metro stop on the corner, a 5 minute walk to the Bund and about the same to Peoples Square in the other direction.We noticed that Intrepid Tours puts its tour groups up at the Nanjing Hotel and its easy to see why. "
nanjing hotel ,Very central. A nice hotel in the heart of Shanghai. Close to subway and close to the Bund. Nice and clean rooms with a good city view. Reasonable priced. 
nanjing hotel ,"Great location Clean, comfortable, large rooms with english speaking staff just off Nanjing Road, 5 mins to Bund. Underground train just around the corner. Excellent local restaurants opposite the hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel but was told it was v. ordinary. Turn right out of hotel and head 1 block to find small supermarket, 1 more block and you'll find good, cheap laundry. Also great breakfast snacks in this area. No hairdryer in the room but one available in reception if you can get it. Recommend taking your own. "
nanjing hotel ,"Great location This is a nice hotel in a great location, just next to Nanjing Rd and only 10minutes walk to The Bund. Although not 5 star it is very clean with friendlyEnglish speaking staff. I would recommend this for anyone and it is a good price also. "

new asia hotel ,"Really nice It was a great surprise when we discovered thar our 30€ bedroom was a deluxe one with King size bed and a fantastic view. It's really close to the Bund and the city center, in really wlaikng distances, not like they say in other places... I'd really reccomend it. The best hotel in our 10 days trip in China! "
new asia hotel ,"Big average OK hotel Entering the hotel it looks all a bit shabby, the service is OK, just what it takes, but the rooms are modern, the tab with the extra knob for drinking water is interesting and the location is great; cross the brigde and you are almost on the Bund. Have breakfast for the view not for the food; after I had seen the view I avoided it. "
new asia hotel ,"VERY unpleasant staff This is a very good value hotel, rooms are spacious and clean and location is excellent, yet I have rarely found such unpleasant staff in a hotel worldwide!!! They seem unable to smile and totally annoyed by questions relating to ANY topic. If you insist upon asking for information on the city, you will end up getting a tiny piece of paper with some words scrubbled in Chinese and no one will ever bother explain what they mean (you're supposed to show the piece of paper to taxi drivers, etc). All this refers to ALL employees and managers working in this hotel, both at the reception and in the businness office.Also, once you're out through the main entrance, you will systematically get harassed by people trying to take you to local markets and literally following you in the street until you get really upset and have to yell at them to leave you alone! Why isn't anyone at the hotel doing anything to keep these people away? "
new asia hotel ,"HORRIBLE STAFF with TERRIBLE BREAKFAST and ROOM We were here for 3 Nights and we have book a business room with double bed, at the first sight everything looks ok from outside....and then we were in the Lobby...the Staff were very impolite and couldn't speak English...the bell boy face look like if we smelled bad and very rude to us...Positive: Location is near to Nanjing Lu , can be reach by TaxiNegative:1. very rude, impolite Staff 2. the room smell strange and damp3. the breakfast is poor and please go outside to take your breakfast, you will not miss the breakfast in Hotel...and too expensive for the food and serviceAVOID THIS HOTEL! "
new asia hotel ,"Worst hotel ever stayed in Where to start, thats the problem.The staff are ignorant and rude. I was stood waiting to check out and it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge that i was stood in the lobby. Room service was appaling, i ordered food from there and it took almost an hour for them to send it up, by that time i was no longer hungry. And they add a tip themselves without even checking if thats okay with you.THEY ALSO CONNED ME.The staff were dishonest.I wanted to change 50GBP into chinese RMB, roughly 500yuen. And i pocketed the money thinking I could trust them. But when i went to pay for something the next day, i noticed that it was not yuen, but it was infact Taiwaneze dollars. (100 yuen=£10 100TaiwanezeD=£2) This meant that i lost £40. I then went and complained to them, and they refused to hand back a single penny. They denied everything. THIS HOTEL CANNOT BE TRUSTED!The bedding was not made, the bathroom was unclean. the wardrobe was too small to even fit hangers in it.I would not recommend this hotel to ANYONE. "
new asia hotel ,"Luxurious room for a bargain-basement price Several reviewers here reported on poor-quality rooms -- but my room here in April 2009 was of 4 or 5-star quality, and nearly as nice as the Park Prince in Tokyo I'd been in the previous week. The interior finish was beautiful and in perfect condition, and the linens and bedcovers were luxury quality. It may be that there are some sub-standard rooms; if you happen to get one of these, ask for better. The neighborhood right around the hotel doesn't have much happening, but it isn't far, -- an inexpensive cab ride or walk, -- from the fashionable tourist areas. For the price I thought this hotel was a very good value. "
new asia hotel ,"Price and location OK food and service poor We came with a tour and I had tried to get a 2 night extension online 6 weeks before but they didn't respond at all after several attempts. So we decided to wait till we got there with the group. No problem getting extra nights. Room was nice no great view and of course noisy street outside - no big deal use earplugs if you want the window open for fresh air. No a/c in roomBeds hardest we had experienced in China - Hong Kong and Mexico hard! There is a security light on the inside of the door that has a mind of its own and comes on and off intermittently all night. There is no possible way to turn it off so take eye shades. The bath tub is deep and very slippery so one needs to be very careful. We asked for a non slip mat but they don't have them.Food was poorest of all the places we ate over 3 weeks They do not set places at the table, the coffee and tea were well stewed and disgusting. The buffet breakfast was all lukewarm even early in the morningThe staff at reception were curt and rude and not in the least bit helpful. We asked about things in the neighbourhood but they either didn't understand or didn't know.The rooms were clean and the towels good, there was a kettle and tea and drinking water tap. I have stayed in other 3 star hotels that had more helpful staff and better food. "
new asia hotel ,"Fantastic for price paid I was amazed at what under £20 a night can buy you. The room was of a high standard, very clean. It was a little small but they did have larger rooms. The lobby is spacious and you can get around town by taxi easily and cheaply. The service is not great, they seem to have a large desk with different sections you should use but I stood there for minutes and the staff had the heads down and I was basically ignored. I was eventually served and English was spoken by most staff. They made a mistake with my bill and double charged me but they did apologise and rectify the situation before I had even noticed it. Ignore the touts outside the hotel wanting you to go to their shops! The main shopping street is about a ten minute walk but be warned as a tourist you will get constant hassle from people selling watches, dvd etc. "
new asia hotel ,"it was tolerable It's really cheap and not a bad cab ride. But except for cheap wares and shabby restaurants there's not much nearby. Also, the rooms are tiny with stained sheets, tiny closets (not deep enough for hangers) and a dingy bathroom. The hotel massage parlor appears to be prostitutes - I didn't check it out myself, but there was a sketchy guy in the lobby handing out cards with girls in bikinis. And the girls looked like hookers when I saw them in the hallways. Also the place smells like an ashtray and left all my clothes smelling like an ashtray. The fitness center and business center were so bad the might as well not be there at all. "
new asia hotel ,"With this low price what can you complain about? With this low price at RMB216 (subject to a 10% charge, totally RMB238) per night, I am very satisfied with this hotel even though it has some downsides:1. In the middle of the night, I could sometimes hear people in the next room talking and also I could hear the door bell in a neighbour room rang. I believe it not only attributes to the thinner walls, but the uncontrolled voices of people (as many local Chinese do);2. The bathroom wall facing the bedroom is made of glass with a venetian blind outside. The venetian blind cannot be totally closed up, so if you are sharing the room with non-lovers, it will be so embarrasing (luckily I travel alone this time).All other provisions are excellent: clean and large room, hot and strong shower with bath tub, slippers toothpaste toothbrush shower cap shampoo bath gel bed sheets renewed everyday (which I don't think necessary for environment saving), safe (I walked back to hotel alone after 10pm), good location of 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East Road and Metro Station, staff normal, smooth reservation via venere.com.Bonus: A drinkable water tap apart from the usual water tap on the sink, electric water pot, hair dryer, safe deposit box.Some reviewers said there are nothing in the neighbourhood besides mobile phones, electronics shops. Actually there is a small shopping mall in the north of the hotel along the Sichuan Road, about 4 minutes walk away.Shanghai is my new favour for weekends or short vacations where there is no need to make up or dress up, so you can just relax. It's full of creation and fun.Back to the hotel, it worths much more than it costs. I've just been to Paris in January. With the same provisions, it at least costs Euro 100 in Paris. "
new asia hotel ,"New Asia Was Awesome I stayed at the New Asia with my high school on a cultural tour earlier this year. It was by far the best hotel I stayed in whilst in China. The staff were friendly, it was close to good shopping, and the breakfast was great. They do however need a larger seating area in the breakfast buffet - my friends and I usually had to sit at other peoples tables due to the lack of free ones.Otherwise, a great experiece. "
new asia hotel ,"Just fine for $50/night The people that dogged this hotel obviously did not think through what you get for $50/night. If you are looking for a bed that's comfy enough, a location that is central enough (especially considering taxis to most places are $2-$3), and a hotel that's clean enough for $50 a night, then the New Asia is just fine. The front desk speaks english and they were plenty helpful to me. The breakfast is even pretty decent for a couple of days at about $4.50, it just gets tiresome eating the same thing for breakfast every day. If you are high maintenance or want a 5 star hotel at a 3 star price then go elsewhere. As far as women of the night, I was approached by a man trying to sell &quot;massages&quot; at 3am one night, but that can be expected in a lot of places at 3am in Shanghai.Also, my advice to find the hotel (which was a bit difficult without a good map) is to take the Maglev, switch to the metro and get off at East Nanjing Rd-that way you don't have to switch lines. Head East on Nanjing (away from the Bund and the river) about 2 blocks then turn left (north) on Sichuan and walk about another 4-5 blocks. The hotel is just over a bridge on your left at Tiantong rd. Hope this helps. "
new asia hotel ,"Good location Stayed here as a family at the end of a month long trip travelling China. This hotel is fairly central - just a short walk from Nathan Road (over one bridge) and close to shopping and restaurants. The hotel is a clean, 3 star property. Nothing amazing but basic and clean. Beware of rip-off taxi drivers if you get them from the front door - we had one not put on the metre and overcharge us to take us out to an acrobats show. "
new asia hotel ,"Avoid at all costs....... I was on group tour with other students from Portland State University. This 'hotel', actually more of a brothel, was awful. Rooms were dirty, bathroom shower had paint peeling off the tiels, ventilation was inadequate, 'women of the night' were prowling throughout the hotel, the massage area was actually a front for a prostitution operation. This hotel is unsatisfactory for overnight stays.......many better options out there...... "
new asia hotel ,"Very Satisfied We booked this hotel through internet and was desperate to get here because it actually had a laundry service. We had just come back from Suzhou and Hangzhou and in comparison to the hotels we stayed in those two cities, New Asia Hotel was so much nicer. I liked it from the moment we got off the cab cuz they actually had a bellboy serving us. We saw many foreigners at the lobby and felt secure at instant. The room we stayed at (545) was very nice. They had just re-furnished the room and there was a plasma TV with movie channels(you have to pay about 20-80rmb depending on which movie tho) . Their services were quite satisfying. Laundry service, mini-bar in the room, you can see the bathroom from the bedroom, its like a japanese love hotel. a high-class one. lol the furnitures are made of dark wood and they look modern and classy. The amenities are clean and descent too. We ordered some room service just for the kick of it to see if it's any good. To our surprise, the stir-fried rice was very tasty and the other dishes were yummy too. The breakfast was amazing as well. It is located quite near the bund so we are going to take a walk today but to be honest i just wanna stay in! i'm definately staying here again if i ever come back to shanghai, although it's quite unlikely considering the air pollution and the fact that shanghai people is snobby and they are always trying to rip us off because we are tourists. Highly recommend Hangzhou for a trip. It's beautiful there and the air is so much cleaner. People are very civilized and nice. "
new asia hotel ,"Proceed with caution I booked a room for two nights through elong.com--I think about $35/night--and chose this hotel for its good location and inexpensive rate. I wasn't expecting much. I planned to stay two nights, but actually decided to leave after one night. My room was tiny, dingy (not just a little old but also not really clean), and smelled so strongly of really acrid smoke that my bag still smelled like smoke days later. I woke up and my hair and pj's also reeked. UGH! I would suggest staying here if location + super-cheap-price are your only concerns. Also, I was traveling alone and there wasn't a deadlock or other manual lock from the inside, which creeped me out. Actually, the hotel kind of seemed like a set from a 70s horror movie (but maybe I just got creeped out and then had The Shining on my mind). EVEN SO, it didn't ruin my time in Shanghai--my new favorite city. I can't wait to return...and shell out for someplace a little nicer. "
new asia hotel ,"Better than I expected My friend and I booked a standard twin room for 3 nights. The quality was better than we expected at this cheap price. The room was clean and the beds were quiet comfortable. The location is quite near the city centre, Nanjing Road which we could walk there by around 15 mins. Surprisingly, there are some nice small local food shops around the hotel. FiFi, Italy "
new asia hotel ,"Very nice hotel We stayed here for two nights as part of a group tour. We were told not to expect much but the hotel was actually very nice. It is an old hotel with art deco features inside with only 8 floors. The restaurant is on the top floor. We had a nice room overlooking the electricity cables outside, but it did not matter as we only slept there. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. There is a lot of dark wood everywhere so it is a bit dark.The area around the hotel is not that exciting and somehow we ended up walking around the red light district looking for somewhere to eat! The main shopping centre is about 1 km away and the Bund about 10 mins walk.The night we arrived there were three weddings on in the hotel and we could not get anything to eat which was a bit of a pain, but breakfast was very nice.Shanghai is even bigger than Beijing but more people speak English and there is a bit more Western influence in the city so it was a bit easier to go out on your own. "
new asia hotel ,"Okay Stay at New Asia Stayed in New Asia Hotel as part of a package tour of China. The hotel was by far the worst we stayed in during the whole trip, but still wasn't that bad. The room itself was large and clean and at least had a safe in th room. The real down side to the whole hotel was the choice of drinks in the bar. No wine and no vodka which I just couldn't believe. It forced us to get out of the hotel anyway and there is certainly choice to be had elsewhere. "
new asia hotel ,"worst hotel with dishonest staff i am a frequent traveller. i have stayed in many hotels but none is as worst as this. the staff are all dishonest. Beware of your belongings if you want them to clean your room or check whether they give you a fake note when changing your currency. Ban internet connection. Manager has no basic service manners. overall, i say this is the worst hotel in shangai. they dun even deserve 3 stars "
new asia hotel ,"Nice hotel good location no problems at all My stay here was organised through the tour company I was traveling with and I was more than happy with their choice. The room was comfortable, spacious and was nice and clean. Rooms were serviced daily, so no problems. I did stay on here for a couple of days after the tour finished and felt very safe and comfortable. I had a room on one of the higher levels and had a view looking out to city. It was lovely at night. Being on a main street, it was a little noisy but nothing overly horrible that I couldn't sleep.Breakfast was included and being a westerner in a eastern country, it was quite an experience. Luckily by the time we got to Shanghai we were used to the 'western style' breakfasts. Spam has never looked so good :-) hehehe... It's not exactly what were be used to, but it is fine to get you by. It was appreciated that they made an effort to cater for us. Hey, your in a foreign country so can't complain really.The staff were ok. I found the same attitude with every hotel we stayed at. They spoke very limited English and were abit abrupt, but I think that's just how they are. Often they would find a staff member that could speak English and help you out. We were lucky enough to have an English speaking guide traveling with us, so she was our last resort. Location - not too bad. Was about a half hour (slow) walk to the Bund. Taxi's are always at the front door to take you where ever you need to go and are quite reasonably priced. There are major retail shops just around the corner and Nanjing Road isn't far in a taxi. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as a clean, comfortable place to stay. "
new asia hotel ,perfectly adequate I booked this hotel through elong.net. I was mostly driven by price- it seems hard to get something below 300 RMB in Shanghai. We had a double room with attached bath.I thought the hotel was perfectly adequate- not the Hilton but for this price i don't expect the Hilton. Reception staff was helpful and spoke good english. we used the business center to book train tickets and to surf the web and all went well.I never eat in Hotel restaurants so cannot comment on the food there. 1 block away is a busy alley (Zhapu Lu) full of restaurants and shops and foot massage places- convenient. there are convenience stores within 50m from the hotel and we never had any problem finding a taxi.If you are looking for an affordable place to stay I surely would recommend New Asia. 
new asia hotel ,"Fading glory in China Located on a busy street corner, 10-15 mins walk from the tourist haven that is the Bund, The New Asia Hotel foyer is impressive. However our double room felt like it belonged to a different hotel. Definitely in need of renovation, the carpet was old and stained, the double bed was small and had seen better days, the shower took its time to heat up and the bathroom could do with some quality time with a scrubbing brush and some bleach.The staff were polite, but only as helpful as they absolutely had to be, don't expect much help with maps or suggestions of where to eat. Check out was a bit stressful with lots of people behind the desk, but only 2 people allowed to handle check out and the excessive amount of paperwork required to effect this.We stayed in their cheapest level of room and saw in the door of some rooms that seemed to be more modern than ours. Also, the room rate we got was competitive. "
new asia hotel ,"What are you looking for? Yes.. what are you looking for?In August, we were looking for a budget hotel, not too far from the Bund, 3/4 stars.. after having seen at a lot of hotels from a chinese web site with very good discounts, we booked this hotel for three night.The rate was 26 euro / room / night, standard room, and, in Shanghai, is a really good price. The hotel is an &quot;old style&quot; building, 15 minutes walking from Bund. We were given 8th floor room, small, queen bed, but prepared for one (I think they gave us a single room used as double). No view (in front of the hotel they were building something), but, even if small, the room was ok.. good air conditioned and clean.The only problem was a little &quot;smell&quot; of wet, which was reduced in a few hours keeping the air condition at max speed.We had a some problems with the employers: they were really rude, very poor English, and every our request seemed to annoy them. For example, I went to the receptionist asking her if she could write in chinese an address for the taxi driver.. I've been answered &quot;Give me your Passport&quot;. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Passport&quot;. She didn't help me untill she verified I was a hotel guest.Breakfast (3 euro), was ok, nothing special, both chinese (75%) and continental (25%) but good to give you energy for the long day.The street itself is not Nanjing Road (no shops, no restaurant), but you can find everything in 10 minutes walking. We come back walking at 11:30 pm, but we felt safe and we had no problem. Anyway, remember that a taxi can take you anywere for about 1 or 2 euros (Pudong is 2,5 euro)I did not try the hotel restaurant ( I avoid them on holiday), so I cannot give my opinion.Well, if you are a budget traveller, looking for a place to sleep, safe, clean, location ok, this is the hotel for you. If you are a family, with child, or a businnes traveller, probably you should find something else (even if the deluxe rooms could be larger and more confortable). "
new asia hotel ,"Great location cheap room rate Right bang on Nanjing Rd Pedestrian area, so road traffic noise no real problem. Comfortable room and hotel seems to have been recently refurbished . Managed to get a great online room rate from (--). BUT beware , the very cheapest rooms have no windows!!. As we where staying a week the extra RMB60 per day was well worth it. If you have the energy you could probably bargain this down a bitCheaper rooms not overly large but adequate and we where only back in the hotel for sleep. Literally 10 -15 minutes walk to Bund, Peoples square , Shangahi museum. Did not use the hotel restaurant as so many great and cheap restaurants all around. Mojo Coffee down Nanjing Rd aways provided morning caffiene fix.Hotel staff helpful and English pretty good at reception. Note that they would not provide and iron to press clothes - you have to send out to laundry service- which was cheap and great service but not so great when I needed to iron a clean shirt for a busniess meeting!Major Hint-- - make sure you take and empty suitcase to Shanghai as YOU WILL buy stuff! If you are staying in Shanghai, you may as well stay right in the action and from RMB 300 per night the price is right! "
new asia hotel ,"Not the best place I have experiences with other cheap but good hotels in Shanghai but wanted to stay near the Bund this time for the fun of it. So I decided to stay at the New Asia Hotel which I found through the Trip Advisor website.This hotel is in the eastern side of Shanghai and the good things about the hotel are: (i) its not far from the Bund (ii) its not very expensive (iii) the rooms were small but clean (but mine had no view what soever.) (iv) the hotel felt quite safe.The not so good things are: (1) the immediate neighbourhood around the hotel is not very interesting or attractive (seems to have a concentration of shops selling hardware and industrial products); (2) the hotel restaurant is not great and you would have to walk a good 10 minutes or more to decent restaurants which can be a hassle if its raining coz taxis are also more difficult to come by during peak hours when it rains (isn't it like this the world over??); (3) the Hotel is dfinitely NOT within walking distance to the nicer areas of shanghai such as hengshan lu area, a leafy area which was formerly part of the French and German concession (so I was told) where most of the consulates are located and where there are lots of nice restaurants, bars etc) (4) the hotel is NOT near the business and financial area which around the Portman RitzCarlton area (could be 45 minutes by cab during peak hours) (5) it is not near the Yu Yuen and Lao Shanghai Jie and other places frequented by tourists which are further south (could be 20 minutes by cab during peak hours);(6) it is not near Xin Tian Di, a happening place for bars and such in Shanghai. The worst thing about New Asia Hotel is that you have to pay for internet access. It's one of those strange things in Shanghai that you can usually get free high speed broad band access in a cheap hotel but have to pay for it if you are staying in an expensive hotel (like the Shangri La or equivalent). Perhaps I'm the one at fault, but I've stayed in other cheap but good hotels in Shanghai and Beijing and never had to pay for broadband access so I was shocked to be told it was chargeable. Broad band access was about US$8.00 per day.As I travel to Shanghai in part for business and in part for fun, I will not staying at the New Asia Hotel again. "
new asia hotel ,"A decent enough cheap option I stayed here for 5 nights, leaving on the 13th of Jan. Pretty good location - only 10 mins from the Bund - decent price, v.good breakfast, though the food in the restaurant itself was below average. In fact the restaurant has no character at all. Best to get out and about for food. The facade of the hotel is being cleaned, so my room, and most others, have no view at all of the street outside. I opened the curtains in the morning to find just a tarpaulin drawn across. Didn't hear much noise from the workmen though. The cleaning will go on until mid-february, which is certainly a negative, but i think that online prices are lower than normal because of this. "
new asia hotel ,Nice rooms lousy food An OK hotel with lousy breakfast. The location of the hotel and condition of the room were excellent. 
new asia hotel ,"Good hotel with great breakfast The twin room I stayed in was fairly large, clean and in good condition. The hotel itself is close to several good shopping streets, and lots of bars and restaurants. The best bit of the hotel though is the breakfast, with a wide range of both Chinese and Western style foods. "

new harbour serviced apartments ,"Centrally located convenient and roomy We stayed here for 6 nights and booked here based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were so glad that we did! We booked a 3 bedroom apartment for 4 people. One room was a queen sized bed, one had only a twin bed in it, and the third room had two twin beds with a TV. All rooms had individual air conditioning and heating units. We got a great deal on Expedia.The hotel/apartment is located across the street from a mini-market, which was convenient for snacks and essentials (unfortunately it did not have any fruit or veggies but did have meat, coffee and eggs). The hotel is located 2 blocks from the Line-8 (blue line) Metro stop at Dashije. This made accessing the metro very convenient. People Square, Nanjing Lu, and Old Town/Yuyuan Gardens are an inexpensive 12 RMB taxi ride away (People Square may be walkable but it was very cold when we were there). You can take the Maglev (50 RMB) to the green line (I think its line 3, but not sure), and then transfer to Line 8 (blue line) to get to the hotel or take a taxi ride which should be no more than 130 RMB depending on traffic.Check-in took a bit of time as it required all passports to be written down on a form by the registration staff. They had our reservation correctly and the english was understandable. There is a doorman and always people to help get you a taxi if you need it. There are many restaurants nearby and on your way to the Metro. There is also a bakery nearby for some early morning treats. Our rate did not include complimentary breakfast, which was a bit pricey, so we did not try that. We also did not try the internet. We did however use the laundry self-service which was 15 RMB for a wash and 15 RMB for a dry for 5 kg of laundry (about $5 US for a small load). The pool was closed for the winter so we did not try that. As reported by other Trip Advisor posts, there was construction going on in the hotel. We were on the 4th floor and it sounded like it was above us. It did not bother us so much as it ended by 6pm each day and did not start until about 9am.I really enjoyed our stay as the apartment was very roomy and the location was centrally located to all that we wanted to see. Unfortunately, the Bund was still under construction, so we did not get to see that, but we did see it from the Pudong side. The rooms were large with comfortable bedrooms and good sized clean bathrooms. The kitchen was a bit small and included a refridgerator/freezer, stove, microwave, sink and water cooler. We chose not to pay to rent our kitchen equipment (10 RMB a day) and instead bought a pan and used paper plates/utensils. The water cooler was a life-saver as it actually boils water, so we were able to have coffee/tea, ramen, etc. for our first night even though we had not yet bought our pan. The living room included a couch and two side chairs and a TV. There were many channels on the TV including english stations. The service was great with daily maid service and they gave us 3 gallons of bottled water for the water cooler upon arrival. There were also shampoo, body lotion and hand soap dispensers and a hair dryer in each bathroom. If I were to visit Shanghai again, I would definitely chose to stay at this hotel again! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Excellent value and location and good view The location is excellent and we got a pretty good price. Our room was on the 24th floor and we had a great view of the People's Square and the Museum. The room was essentially a two bedroom suite although one room was set up as an office. One breakfast was included each day. The breakfast buffet served a good variety of food so we had lots of choice. They are starting some renovations on some floors and the pool will be updated over the next two months.The hotel is one block away from a &quot;food street&quot; so there are about 20 restaurants to choose from. There is a small grocery store across the street if you choose to cook in the tiny kitchen or want snacks. The hotel provided a medium size bottled water cooler - about 12 litres.The old city is a short walk away from the hotel. The Bund is undergoing extensive renovations so there is nothing to see but walls. Shanghai is hosting a World Expo in 2010 so the Bund and the city will be much better next year. If you plan to take a cab to the hotel from the airport or the Maglev train, make sure you print the English and Chinese directions from their website to show your cab driver. They also have business card size directions at the front desk to help you get back from your excursions. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"reasonable rate good location The building is close to the metro station, and IMO, the metro is the best way to get around Shanghai. Also, it is within reasonable walking distance to Renmin Square and Nanjing Road. I also noticed in this area that there are not watch salesmen every 50 meters trying to sell you a watch (Note, as I'm sure countless others have posted, a simple &quot;bu yao&quot; and they will leave you alone). Also, the apartment I had was spacious and clean. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Location location location We stayed 6 nights arriving early in the morning after a flight from Phnom Penh that left in the early hours. We had booked the previous night so we would be checked straight in when we arrived (using the maglev, then the metro to Peoples Park then a 2 minute taxi ride from the airport) and because we hadnt actually used the night they let us check out late at no extra cost. Our two bedroom apartment came with a living area and small kitchen, bottled water and a microwave. The kitchen cupboards were completely empty (plates, cuttlery etc can be hired) except for 2 water glasses (in the bathroom) and 2 mugs but there is a small supermarket across the road, a huge variety of street food, subway, macdonalds, coffee bean (stuff we dont have in PP)etc a few minutes walk away plus on the bottom floor of the Shanghai Times Square building (a couple of blocks away) a western supermarket. The location is brilliant (especially for the price). We walked nearly everywhere, museums, shops, Xin Tan Di, Old Street etc taking the metro across the river (the tunnel and the Bund are still under reconstruction). Our 'room' was cleaned daily and we got fresh towels (plus more when we rang). The hotel is undergoing construction (as is a lot of Shanghai at the moment) and the noise during the daytime was enough to drive us out by 9 but by the time we returned at 4 or 5 it was quiet again. We would definately stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Help yourself... I stayed at the NH twice during the last week and had a similar experience to Ausiemum. I was upgraded both times to a two bed suite with great views of the People's Square- 17th and 22 floors. Approx 300M to the new Dashijie metro and about 10 blocks to Nanjing Lu. You could not hear people in the rooms next door- in the rooms I had- but there was a little traffic noise from the streets below. I tried the room service once and it was average. The breakfast buffet was also average(60RMB). I found a cheap internet gaming lounge in Jinling Lu to offset the 5RMB/min that the hotel wanted to charge- it was 3RMB per hour but had no printing and lots of smokers like everywhere else in China. Even with it's short-comings, I would easily stay again at the price and am considering taking my family next time. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"good hotel could be great with customer service training for reception This was a good hotel that could be great with a few modifications &amp; training for the reception staff on customer relations. On the positive side was the coin-operated laundry so we were able to do our own laundry. It cost 60 RMB to wash &amp; dry 2 loads (would stay again based on this laundry alone). The other positive was the fact that the metro is within 5 minute walk and a corner shop is just across the road. Our 2-bedroom apartment which we got for a great rate through Expedia was spacious and clean (advertised rate at the hotel counter is much higher). There is a kitchen but you will be charged extra for all utensils including kettle and coffee cups. On a negative note was witnessing the argument between reception staff and some guests who had had their belongings locked in their room following a charge dispute. On a strongly negative note, I asked a receptionist for assistance in booking the ERA circus show (understanding that they charge to make a booking unlike other hotels I stayed at in China). After unsuccessfully trying to convince me to book with their hotel affiliated acrobatic show instead she handed me on to the senior male staff member – may have been the manager (???) - who told me that ERA was not good and that they did not do acrobatics (not true – see trip advisor reviews!). When I still assured him that we still wanted to go to ERA he telephoned their booking service, then told me that they only had the most expensive seats left 590 RMB seats (approx $100 Aust a night) not the 290 RMB seats that I had just seen available via the hotels internet. When I queried this he assured me that the internet details were not accurate. Frustrated, I made my way via metro to the ERA circus ticket office where they had plenty of 290 RMB seats available (surprise, surprise!). This led to a basic lack of trust in the hotel staff (although the laundry ladies were lovely). Having seen the ERA show I would have been very disappointed to have missed it because of the hotels affiliation with another acrobatic show. So, if you are prepared to rely on yourself at this hotel and pay all the extra charges, you can have a great location, spacious, clean apartment, and access to affordable laundry. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great locations large apartments well suited to English speakers We stayed 6 nights at the New Harbour Apartments. The apartments are great value for money, large and have a great swimming pool if you are travelling with children. It is centrally located and there are many shops nearby. It is close to the old town area (sort of in it being on one edge) which if you are not used to traveling in Asia may cause some culture shock.We hired a guide for the pick up from the airport and six days of guiding. We used Jean from ourexplorer and are glad we did. ( Feel free to contact me if you wish any other info.)The major difficulty in shanghai is getting a taxi. Even with the address card from the hotel some taxis can't or will not be able to take you their. They either do not know the street or it is not worth their while from the location they are at. The cost of the guide was minimal to the cost of the holiday, added lots of value in sightseeing and eased all the problems of getting back to the hotel. As we were two families travelling we needed three taxis each time. Jean then showed us the metro as well which is a short two block walk from the hotel.Back to the hotel, we stayed in a two bedroom suite our friends stayed in a three bedroom. They were both clean and maintained each day. Having the kitchen and full sized refrigerator is a great bonus. Breakfasts were included each day and they were more than suitable. The hot items were similar but different on each morning.Everyone spoke English which was unexpected. The laundry service was great value and prompt. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Much more than expected Stayed at New Harbour apartments from 7th Sept- 14th Sept 09 with the teenage boys in a three bedroom apartment. Had booked this after heaps of research on this site. We were more than happy with the level of accomodation our boys had their own room which was great, plenty of room to spread out. Had read beds were not good but have to say that our beds were fine as were the pillows. The cultery was not an issue I just took a few plastic pieces with me which sufficed as well as coffee as they charge u for coffee in the room. Water cooler in kitchen which was great and microwave no kettle but no problem. Breakfast inculded for three of us but at 60rmb for the other was not a problem, breakfast was adequate for us westerners obviously not your 5star buffet but had all that we required ie yogurt,cereal,toast,eggs,fresh fruit,juices,coffee. Location is just minutes from Dashjie metro, 10 min walk to Peoples sq and bund although the construction on the bund makes it hard to access from puxi side. The area around the apartments is very local which we loved, we had no problem wandering around at night. Two streets from the snack street, small supermarket across road very cheap for snacks and soft drinks 2litre coke about 1.00aud, fresh milk etc. We were on 26th floor which was just great we had great views. Air conditioning in all rooms, as well as windows that opened which i loved. Laundry can be done on 3rd floor yourself detergent is supplied and at 30rmb for a 5kg wash and 30rmb to dry it saves alot of hassles especially travelling with kids. Internet is in rooms but did think it a tad expensive my 15yr old did go down to the business centre on 2nd floor and it was 20rmb for 30mins which is still pretty expensive. McDonalds just down around the corner right on metro if u are desperate for a junk hit. Overall i would recommend this hotel, we do plan to go back real soon, as we just loved Shanghai. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"excellent - nice surprise We (3 friends) stayed in September 2009 and were very impressed. The 2 bedroom apartment was very clean and spacious enough for the 3 of us. The kitchenette was small, but then we ate out anyway. The pool and spas were fabulous as was the restaurant and the excellent buffet style breakfast. The apartments are well located and an easy taxi ride to Yuyuan Gardens and the surrounding market as well as the subway station. It is an easy 15 minute walk to the Bund. Unfortunately, the Bund is completely inaccessible as it is totally under construction for the World Expo 2010. But we walked until we came across the pedestrian crossing and went under the river to the Pudong area which has a great walking area along the river as well. Rather than go up to one of the observatories, we chose to go to the Cloud 9 Bar on the 88th floor at the Grand Hyatt in the evening and had the best views of the Bund etc and had a drink for the price of going to Jinmao Tower - a little tip for you. But all in all we would absolutely recommed the New Harbour Apartments and would most definitely stay there if we are ever in Shanghai again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Much more than I expected!! My husband I stayed at the New Harbor Service Apartments from Sept. 9th- 15th. This was not our first trip to China. This hotel was one of the best ones we have stayed at. First, remember if you travel to a country that is vastly different from your culture and there are just some things you are going to have to get used to. The smells, sounds and the way the people react to you if you can’t speak their language. Chinese people are very friendly. If you just give a smile and are kind they will respond kindly back to you. Remember you are the foreigner now. Everything we needed was available to us at the hotel. If you want a 1, 2 or 3 bedroom it is available with a good size refrigerator and gas stove top. If you want to cook you can rent the utensils from the hotel. Let them know when you check in. There are 2 sizes of the 1 bedroom. If you are going to stay a few days and only need a 1 bedroom get the larger of the 2 for no extra charge. It was very roomy. The front desk has English speakers, (not great, but they will try to help you as best they can) and if you think that standing there at the desk and making rude comments is appropriate, don’t. They may not be able to speak or completely understand everything you are saying, but they can understand a lot. So be kind!!! They aren’t stupid. Just use common words and speak slowly (try learning their language). We were able to exchange money very easily. Don’t bring travels checks, it is hard in some hotels to get them cashed and some times you have to go to a bank. This could take several hours (believe me, we have tried). Bring cash and keep it on a money belt on you at all the times. We needed airline tickets to travel to another city and they accommodated us with a smile and efficiency. I needed an iron and ironing board. I called the desk and asked if the person who answered spoke English, and she was able to help me. The only negative I could add is the internet costs about $10 USD per day. The time starts each day at noon and goes to noon the next day. They have an in-house as well as a self service laundry on the 3rd floor. It was very convenient for us to wash 2 loads of clothes and dry 1 for less than $8USD. Just outside the hotel is a small grocery store and you can get most things you need. McDonalds and KFC are also very close by (just a 5 minute walk). If you want to eat at the hotel, the restaurant is very good. The menus have English, so try some new foods. There are a number of Starbucks close as well if you need a regular coffee fix. If you are in the mood for some shopping, ask the front desk for directions to “The Nanjing Walking Street” a huge street with every kind of shop possible. It’s near People Square and you will love it. Hope you enjoy this hotel as much as we did. Very family friendly! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great for families I stayed for a week with mypartner, my 2 year old and my 6 yr old, who learnt to swim in the pool. We had two bedrooms, they added a cot for free. The food is all right but the building is next to one of the most famous restaurant streets in Shanghai. The appartments are large with nice views. The location of the hotel is excellent, near people square, the old city, the old market, 10 mn from Nanjing Lu and 5 mn from the underground station, two stops from Pudong. It was a very good place to stay at with children, and near everything we needed. The staff was friendly if not completely fluent at english. They didn't know that the Bund promenade is closed to pedestrians until the EXpo 2010. Try the massage parlour on yongshou road, 1mn from the hotel, 30 yuan for a full body massage, you will not forget. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Basic but good value &quot;This hotel is really good. It has a really good view. Maybe not on the floor that you have. It is a big place. The rooms are big. It does have a pool. It is nice and chilly. The bedroom is big. The breakfast has delicious stuff. I liked the bacon and the toast. It's not far away from lots of stuff. It is from some stuff but not much. If you have kids, the pool liked I talked about would be really good fun.&quot; Scarlett (aged 5)We stayed for 3 nights in a two bedroom apartment and booked on expedia.com for AU$320 / 3 nights. One bedroom had two big singles, the other a small double. We decided to push the singles together, and then made up a bed with the couch cushions for one of our two children. The apartment is large and clean - decor is basic, but fine. It was good to have some space after being used to all cramming into one hotel room. The staff are not particularly friendly. Breakfast is okay - with many asian choices, eggs to order, a small selection of fruits and cereals, and toast. We didn't use the kitchen, as eating is so cheap. The hotel delivers a complimentary 3 gallon bottle of fresh water, which we appreciated. They also have a self-service laundry, and we did a huge wash and dry for only 45yuan - another great service on offer. We found this task had been very difficult in Beijing - so it was great to have clean clothes. They are doing some renovation work at the moment, which disturbed us a little during the night. There was no mention of this at booking or check-in. We liked that the hotel is on a very typical Shanghai street - with all the aromas and colour of real life. We walked to major shopping areas, despite the intense heat, and it was nice to return home to a well air-conditioned place, and the pool as well. My husband had his hair cut at a place opposite the hotel for 10 yuan (AU$1.80). We used their 24 hours of internet in the room, but on check out were billed for two days - because the 24 hours covered noon- noon. This was very annoying as it was not explained at all when we organized it, and we were very careful not to use beyond the 24 hour period. I would recommend this hotel if you want to save money, yet have a spacious comfortable, and quite well-located spot with a family. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Value and Great Location! This was a perfect place for four of us. We booked a two-bedroom Apt throght Hotel.com for $110/night. My husband and I had a room with a Queen size bed, our teenage boys shared a room with two single beds. The Apt. also has a huge living room, and a small kichen with a fridge and wate bottle. We were not gong to cook, but the fridge was a nice option. We love the do-if-yourself laudry service at the 2nd floor. After staying for 6 days, I did 4 or 5 loads of laudry for a very reasonable fee. My boys enjoyed the indoor swimming pool and the ping-pong table. The only complain I have is the internet charges. The location can't be better. It is close to the Bund and within walking distance to Nanjing and HuanHai Road. The subway is also nearby. There are Shangai styled residential area nearby. You can see the real Shangainese living there, some of them making and selling food. A lot of old buildings have been torned down to build high rises. I do hope they will keep these ones. This makes Shangai fasinating, unique and interesting with its own flavor. I would absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Shanghai. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great location - shame about the staff and the 'extras' We stayed here for 3 nights last week, having booked a 3-bedroom apartment through Expedia. On arrival, staff insisted we had only reserved 2 rooms and only grudgingly gave us the apartment we had booked. I wanted to visit Tong Li for which they quoted me an hourly rate for a driver (taxi) - the taxi driver was very happy to switch on the meter and to be paid for it; however the hotel receptionist who had arranged it complained that I had not paid for the hours they had estimated. Because I had returned earlier than they expected, the cost had been less (and presumably their cut was less). Also, on checkout, they insisted I had taken some drinks from the fridge - they were not too bothered what these might be as long as I paid them for 2 bottles!The rooms were spacious (apart from the bathrooms) and clean. However, there is some rennovation work currently going on - this week, they were working on the water pipes/supply which meant no hot water followed by all water being a rather murky brown colour for a while. There is a kitchen but no utensils, etc - they are available but at a cost.We found that it was repeatedly difficult to flag a taxi from the hotel (I would assume that in rush hour or rain, things would be much worse). However, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Peoples Square and the subway. The hotel could not provide a local map and charged 15 RMB for a tourist map that proved to be useless - the ones in most guide books would suffice. Wired internet access is available for 30RMB for an hour or 70RMB for a 'day'.There are numerous grocery stores/supermarkets nearby where you can buy drinks, food, fruit and other 'basics' but based on our experience of other locations within China, you'd be better off staying somewhere where the staff are more pleasant. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great location - smack in the restaurant area! The room was adequate, but not as lavish as the branded chain hotels. Kitchen with boiling/cold water, fridge, micro and stove, but no utensils at all (apart from cups and glasses).Breakfast buffet was adequate, but again not as lavish as the branded chain hotels.Location is very convenient, lots of dinner options around the block: specatacular al fresco seafood places, and several halal offerings if you're a muslim. Many convenience stores too, stock up on soft drinks. Huai Hai road with the big malls is within walking distance, as well as the nearest metro station. Nanjing Road, People's Park and the Bund (although under construction a the moment) is a short taxi ride away.Business center was overpriced, charging 5RMB per page for b/w print-outs. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Fantastic Option for Shanghai Vacation Especially Families We just returned from a 1-week stay in Shanghai at the New Harbour and really enjoyed what the service apartment offered us. Outside of the fact that you get a real apartment living setup, the location was fantastic. We enjoy taking in local life and food, so this is a departure from the swankier hotels along Nanjing West Road where I would stay for business (which frankly is so much less interesting because you are surrounded mainly by brand new malls selling the usual stuff you see in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, etc.)The immediate vicinity of the apartment is a local residential area with lots of very interesting local dining options that caters not to tourists but middle class Shanghai residents. Within a few streets' radius are rows of restaurants of all types, convenience stores, banks, cafes, etc. But the whole area is still nevertheless amidst the bustle of Shanghai city itself. So if weather and legs permit, interesting walks are to be had if one is willing to walk towards Yu Yuan (you'll see local markets, streetlife, etc.) or Nanjing Street (via People's Square) or the Bund. And cabs are easily available everywhere, plus the metro is just around the corner.Our apartment was basic and clean. Although it isn't the Ritz It is definitely much nicer than mid-level national chain hotels in the US like Courtyard by Marriott, Best Western, Holiday Inn, etc. Some of the earlier reviews cited hard beds and carpets... but we didn't get any of those - our beds were regular and most of the floor was new faux wood. There was some renovation going on during our stay but this was confined to the daytime so we weren't bothered by any of it when we were in the apartment mainly in the late afternoon thru early morning.One initial concern I had when we pulled into the driveway was getting cabs because the hotel entrance is not on a main road. This worry was unfounded as the concierge can get one very quickly for you. And most of the time we could easily hail cabs even on the side streets just outside the entrances, otherwise the main street is only less than 20 meters from the hotel entrance where taxis are aplenty. Internet is not free but capped at 70 yuan per day for unlimited usage. And as others have already pointed out you have to rent the basic utensils for the stay (which totalled only around 20 yuan for the whole week for us). Coin-operated laundry can be done yourself onsite but you can also do dropoff with the ladies manning the machine wash area which came out to about US$15 in total for our family to do twice. Overall, these little additionals come on top of a very reasonable room rate... our entire bill for our weekly stay - including an overpriced airport pickup (we had lots of luggage and two young kids), almost daily internet usage, dropoff laundry (twice), utensil rental, 2-bedroom unit, taxes - came up to about US$100 per day which is fantastic value imho. But the best is the fact that it's in a great location for the type of holiday we like - easy access to good food, interesting neighborhood, reasonable proximity to sights, etc. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great hotel that scores high on all fronts As other reviewers have noted, this hotel has a great location. It's close to many major sightseeing sights, stores and restaurants, yet it's in a residential neighborhood that's very quiet. It's also within 5 minute walk of a Metro station. The layout of the apartment rooms is very conducive to a family traveling together. It's very clean. The kitchen, comes handy when you want to heat up something in the microwave or keep something chilled in the refrigerator. The water cooler is a great amenity. The staff are very helpful. Also enjoyed the pool and the gym. The hotel seems to attract a diverse group of international travelers. Compared to many other hotels in town, it offers great value. We would definitely stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great value for money on a top location in Puxi We were 4 persons 50+ couple and 50+ with daughter and had rented 3 bedroom appartment (room 2207) for two times 2 day's in one week time. Appartment has two kingsize-bed rooms, and one single-bedroom. Each bedroom including spacious livingroom had separate airco-unit. To our surprise there was also two toilet/bathroom units; so no long queing after sweaty day out in the city. The breakfast for 3 persons was included and OK; one breakfast paid on site (60 RMB). Actually we choose this appartment looking for &quot;budget hotel including swimpool&quot;, but also without the swimpool (we were to busy in city not using it) this is great value for money on a top location in puxi. Walking distance to peoples square and babyface discotheke. accross the street and around the corner there are supermarket and fruit-stores where you can buy drinks, fruit and other stuff for your daily needs. Bee aware if you want to cook in the kitchen of the appartment you have to bring your own cooking hardware, but who cares cooking yourself with the average diner-price in local restaurants around the corner. Once you know the place you can blindly walk (and sometime's guid taxi-drivers) to the appartmentbuilding, but be aware this location is hard to find for taxi-driver only by showing them address in english (be prepared for having sort of map for showing location of appartment). I would certainly reccomend this appartment to friends and others. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Best possible location for families I was really glad to have found this hotel. Finding somewhere where four people could stay in the same apartment was hard in Shanghai, and the layout of the rooms was absolutely ideal. The staff were (mostly) helpful, and it was very comfortable. I disagree with the travelers that say the beds were too hard. I thought they were just fine. My kids had a lot of fun in the pool, when they'd gotten tired of the bustle of life outside. My only criticism was the cleanliness - it was okay... but you don't want to look to closely in the corners of the bathroom or behind the taps. But hey - every immune system needs a bit of training, and it wasn't that bad, and you don't have to eat off those surfaces. All in all very recommendable. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"great for families We are a family of 4 that stayed for 4 nights at this apartment. We rented a 3 bedroom . Nice and comfortable , not luxurious apartment. staff was attentive. Anything that we needed was just one call away and it would arrive in no time at all. location wise, this apartment is situated in an older residential area of Shanghai. If u want to experience regular living of Shanghai, this could be the place for u. Do not let the surroundings fool you. subways are 5 minutes walk away or the hotel could always hail a taxi for u within minutes. there are plenty of good restaurants that have been around for years around the corner along Yunnan Street. Xiaoshaoxing restaurant famous for its chicken are just a block away. Teckshing restaurant- great for old Shanghai delicacies of wontons, xiaolongbao, shenjianbao, noodles and etc are across the street. There a lot of restaurant choices in its viccinity. Shopping is nearby as well about 10 minutes walk to xizhang nanlu. The Bund is 20 minutes walk away even though i would avoid the bund until Shanghai Expo. you see, the bund is being heavily renovated at the moment in preparation for next year world's expo in Shanghai. most of the roads are sealed off. makes sight seeing very dusty and incovenenint. crossing the street is a hassle at the bund nowadays not to mention that you are literally eating dust when the traffic flew by u. Anyway, i would recommend this hotel to families only. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great value. We are an extended family of 5, ages 18-58. We stayed here 6 nights and were very pleased. This is a great value in the Puxi district of Shanghai. It's a short walk to the Dashijie subway Station. We had a 3-bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms. One bedroom had a king bed, one had a double bed and the 3rd had a twin bed. This is not luxurious but is very clean and spacious. The employees are friendly and helpful. If the person helping us could not speak English, he/she got someone else. There is a small grocery store across the street which was great for buying bottled water and snacks. Three breakfast passes were part of the deal but we bought two others for each morning. We enjoyed the breakfast and thought it was very handy. Breakfast is a buffet with both western and Chinese breakfast items. As to other meals at the restaurant, I would not bother. We had a dinner here that was very mediocre. There are many restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood. There is a business center in the hotel that has an Internet computer which costs 20 yuan for 1/2 hour. There is also an internet cafe a couple of blocks away but we didn't try it. Be sure to get some business cards at the front desk with the name printed in Chinese so that your taxi can get you back. This location is close to the People's Square. As a group, we enjoyed having the living room rather than just the typical hotel rooms. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Solid hotel especially for families I live in Nanjing and get into Shanghai often for business and sometimes with family. I originally found this when looking for a hotel that could fit a family of four which is hard in China. The apartments with multiple bedrooms are great. Children and parents can get some good rest. Since then I have been using it for business travel. It's a solid value in a great location other then being hard to find. Highly recommend it for business and family travel. If you log onto their site you can get a member's discount too and an easy way to track reservations. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"great location good service clean and a real find we were two adults and an 11 year old boy and this hotel / serviced apartments were great. They had the usual &quot;no utensils / no cooking stuff&quot; in apartments but the space and the layout of the apartments were good.service: on a number of occassions the staff really excelled and helped us in not just booking rail tickets but in returning lost tickets, getting refunds, holding travel bags, phoning us when deliveries were made etc. the place is in the 'thick of it' but remains quite quiet so you can get a good nights sleep and retreat. I chose this place because i noticed an absence of bad reviews - now i know why. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Perferct accomodotion for relaxed sightseeing We wanted to stay 1 week in Shanghai and were looking for good accomodation on a good location (near Bund/Nanjing Road or close to subway). And we found it all in New Harbour Service Appartments, also because of the good comments on this site. We had an appartment on the 15th floor with nice views on Renmin square and the streets of the neighbourhood. The rooms were spacious and very convenient. The kitchen indeed hasn't got any utensils, but you can rent them or you can buy them at the store across the street. There were also 2 TV's, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The bathroom was a little bit old, but worked perferctly and was clean.We didn't include breakfast in our booking, but there are several good bakeries in the surrounding area, so you can have fresh croissants for breakfast if you want!It takes you about 15min to walk towards the Bund, although a taxi is very cheap 11 RMB. In 5-10 min you are at Nanjing Road and or Renminsquare. Also French Concession is on walking distance and for further destinations you walk to the metro. Also very cheap to get around!Internet (if you don't bring your own laptop etc) on the 2nd floor is very expensive (20 RMB per 30 min) and it is also slow. You can find a good internet cafe at the corner with 2 RMB per hour (don't forget to bring your passport for registration).After our week long stay in Shanghai we travelled to other spots but returned to this hotel for our last night. We booked a smaller room, there was no kitchen and the living room was significant smaller. But for a last day it was perfect. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Very Spacious The hotel was very clean and spacious. We had a suite all to ourselves and the price was great. 2 bedrooms, kitchen, large living room and washrooms. The caf was not the best but then again it was more of a hotel to relax at while we saw the sights inn Shanghai. A great place to come back home to rest. The general area is a bit crummy but most of Shanghai is like that to be honest. Hotel staff were very helpful with hailing cabs and giving them instructions on where we wanted to get to. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"About eight minutes walk from People's Square (Renmin Square) With Shanghai booming, accommodation can be expensive in this city; the New Harbour Serviced Apartments offer a sensible alternative. I had been just a little concerned by previous comments about the surrounding area and what looked like confirmation of that from traveller's photographs. However, it just goes to show that appearances can be deceptive! From check-in through waiting staff, cleaners and concierges, all employees are friendly and approachable. The standard of English from the waiting staff was particularly good. On the downside, it must be more than one mile to The Bund - but what a disappoinment that venue was! The Pearl TV Tower across the river - and many other buildings - were wreathed in industrial smog! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Family Friendly New Harbour We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite at the New Harbour for one month with our 4 year old son. The rooms were spotlessly clean - don't let the people who say don't tip in China fool you - I gave about 20RMB (USD 2.50)each week and always had my dishes washed (there's a full kitchen) clean towels, irons etc. There is a full laundry room onsite, you can do it yourself or the hotel will do it very cheaply. There is a clean good sized pool and they let the kids play with frowning at them.The staff was kind and attentive. Room service food was average but inexpensive and when you are dealing with time change it is a big bonus.The neighborhood is awesome. Everything is within an easy walk, Yuyuan Gardens, People's Park, Starbucks and a grocery nearby with every item you loved from home - we got Golden Grahams, Aunt Jemima, organic fruits &amp; veggies- you name it (in Times Square) as well as a market with live frogs, chickens and snakes. As far as old neighorhood and falling down housing, it's China not NY, there is a huge mix of older housing and brand new skyscrapers. Street vendors and upscale restaurants both flourish. It's eclectic not scary. The people are kind and wonderful and interested in you. Go before the whole city is torn down and redeveloped. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good Value and Location Spent 4 nights here in October. We had a 3 Bedroom Superior room and we found the accomodation far better then what has been written by a number of people here.OK Just to set some basic facts1) Yes the beds are hard (REALLY HARD)2) There are no cooking utensils, or cutlery however these can be rented or you can simply go to the corner shop and by these cheaply.3) Yes its in an older part of the town however its no different to most Asian cities, the best locations are in the older areasWe enjoyed our stay, its certainly an easy walk to the Bund or Nanjing RD as well as the Metro.DId we have issue wth Breakfast - NO. For the value I would stay at again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,good value visited here for three days and were a bit worried because some of the reviews were not great. However we booked a two bedroom room for two nights and were really pleased with the room. It was clean and quite roomy.The bathroom was a little bit tiered but clean. Please note it has a kitchen but there are no utensils in it at all. There is a microwave.The room had quite good views and we could even see buildings across the bund. The hotel is situated amongst where people live and work which is really a nice way of seeing real china. The hotel serves a pretty good breakfast but note there was four of us but the price of the room only included two breakfasts per day. It cost us about a fiver to buy more which wasn't bad value.The hotel is fairly near everything but walking can be a feat as the roads are so difficult to cross. We took cabs everywhere as they are really cheap.A tip is to make sure you book transport from the hotel to collect you from the airport.For one there will know where to take you even when its written in chinese the taxi drivers struggle and for two their luggage compartments are really small.All in all we found this hotel good value for money it cost us about £140.00 for our stay for four of us. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Location and Space Great location, central to all the major tourist sites (French Concession, Pudong, The Bund and Old Town). Low level of english at Reception and not very helpful.Bathroom plumbing leaked in our room when we had a bath/shower. Swimming pool also a bit green. Gym facilities were above average. Good internet connection in rooms.Apartments are in the middle of a small local community which added a lot of character but may not be everyone's cup of tea.Much better alternative than a smaller hotel room in a better hotel.Difference between Superior and Deluxe minimal. Room sizes/layouts are exactly the same. Our Deluxe apartment had computer room instead of second bed room.Kitchen's are small and no cooking utensils are supplied (these can be rented). Deluxe apartment bed we had was a queen. Superior room our friends had was a king. All beds are very very hard (Common in China).Small bottled water cooler is in every room but water cooler function was faulty in 2 rooms we had.Used laundry every second day and was efficient and reasonably priced. Air Con worked well in all rooms.We would definetely stay there again. Great value for money and loads of space. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"YMMV but we really liked it We booked the NHSA for 5 nights in late August, based on reviews here and some other research. We generally like to have some extra space if we stay more than a couple of nights so a one bedroom deluxe suited our needs perfectly at a value price and good city location. We booked directly with the hotel website and included a transfer from PVG, which was a relaxed way to arrive after a long flight.The building is a modern block, approx 28 floors I think, on the fringes of a lower level locale close to the old city. Expect to see local street life close by, with several restaurants and small shops. Don’t expect English to be understood in these or Michelin stars, but they are busy which is always a good sign. There are a few convenience stores close by too, as well as a basic supermarket opposite the Eastern entrance of the hotel if you want to get snacks, beer etc. We found the area to be totally safe at any time of the day or night, and felt totally at ease.We found it ideal for access to the metro (line 8, only 5 minutes walk and one stop from Peoples Square where it intersects with lines 1 and 2). To walk to Peoples Square is about 10 minutes, but could take longer, having to cross a couple of busy streets. Taxis are very cheap and plentiful. If you like to explore and walk a bit, the location is great, with Nanjing Lu just north of Peoples Square if that’s your thing. The French Concession, the Bund, Old City and Xintiandi are all in easy walking distance. We used the metro or taxis for trips farther away.We requested and got a high floor, mainly for the possibility of urban views and away from ground level noises (this is a city with more than 18 million people after all). Two guest elevators worked well and we never had to wait long even after the breakfast rush.The apartment was very clean and fully functional, but the bathroom was a little small and maybe needs updating a bit. The bedroom was compact with limited wardrobe space but a nice bed with a firm mattress.The small kitchen was sparsely equipped with utensils, which you can rent if you need them. But it had everything we needed, a fridge and water dispenser. There is also a microwave, cooker hob and washing area. The water dispenser has a hot tap, which gives instant hot water for tea/coffee, as well as a room temperature tap for drinking! No chilled available, but we filled bottles and left them in the fridge for refreshing drinks.We found the staff helpful and efficient, but businesslike mostly at reception and friendlier in the restaurant. Breakfast buffet, a mixture of local and international choices both hot and cold, was good enough for us but don’t expect the Shangri La for 60RMB.I would recommend this property to visitors who are capable and not too dependent. We really liked the whole package, but people are different and it is your choice. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Helpful staff average room and location Booked this primarily because we wanted a little bit extra room for family of four. Booked the room through the hotel website and ended up with a 2 bedroom apartment. Overall, the room was very spacious with lots of room for my wife, 2 kids (ages 4&amp;6) and me. Queen beds in each bedroom were fine. Overall, our particular apartment had some ware an tear, nothing huge just some nicks here and there.To echo an earlier review the water was pretty nasty. Started a bath for the kids and as the water filed the tub it kept getting more yellow. Don't know if this a problem with the hotel or Shanghai in general.The location is a little distance from central Shanghai. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the people's square area. Cheap Taxi ride to the Bund. The immediate area is more residential/local. We were fine with this, as we always enjoy seeing a city outside of the main tourist areas. However, I can see how those less adventurous might be a little bit nervous at night, as once you leave the hotel there are not a lot English friendly places. Having said that I went out late at night to get money from the ATM and made a trip to a local store without any problems. We ate at the breakfast buffet each morning. Adequate but nothing fancy. Used the indoor pool one day, water was a bit warm and smelled of sanitizer. In the locker room there is also a sauna and a jacuzzi. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had no problems with the service. Our Mandarin skills are pretty minimal so we were reliant on the English skills of the front desk staff. Never had a problem! They helped us get to all the areas we needed to get to and helped us book a train to Beijing. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Bad location .. not for first timers I stayed there for 5 days this month based on the reviews here.. but I was quite shocked and disappointed when I reached there. The building is quite good but the adjoining area is like a slump .. quite dirty and smelly... no way u should live in such a neighborhood for ur holidays... rooms were just ok.. with stains on the carpet.. and the bathroom were bad.. and i mean it.. with black stains on the floor and bath tub.. since there is no concierge .. first timer to shanghai would find difficult there... the reception people told me that there is no pizza hut or KFC or Mcdonalds nearby .. and after three days I found out that it was just 200 meters away... I reckon that there are different chinese names for all places and thus people not fluent in english cant guide u anywhere. The bulding is around 1 km away from the main shopping area or Nanjian Road and around 1.5 km from Xian Tin Di .. if u r in shanghai.. its a must go.... Overall the service was quite good .. and staff was courteous... first timers.. please stay away .. its not something which u would like 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Nice Location fair experience We spent 4 days in the New Harbour Service Apartments. We were a party of 9, including 2 older couples and my family that consists of 5, my wife and mself and 3 kids of 6, 4 and 1. We booked 2 rooms. One with 3 bedrooms and the other one with 1 bedroom for one of the older couples.The lobby is ok and the personnel spoke enough english for us to be confortable. The fare that we paid included a breakfast that it is highly recommended. They have eastern/western dishes, very good fruit, good coffe and good bread. Even if your fare did not include it it would be nice to take it.The room was clean and the furniture was in good shape except for the kitchen that was really small and did not have any kind of accessories. It included a stove, a mini microwave oven and drinking water. Air conditioner worked fined and they have minisplits on each room, so you can adjust temparature in your own area without making it unconfortable for everyone else.We requested a crib for our baby and they send it quickly and without any extra charge.The &quot;hotel&quot; is located 3 or 4 blocks away from the &quot;peoples square which is very convinient. It is very easy to take a taxi and there are many convinient store at walking distance.There are also banks nearby because we needed to change usd, the only disadvantage is that it took too long for the banks to change the money.It has a pool that is well mainteined and that was a great idea for the kids, we went down every day and probably was one of the best part of the trip for them. Even when the apartments had a good ocupancy the pools was almost with noone.In my opinion it was a very good option for someone traveling with full family, you could say that it is a Chinese owned property but that attracts customers from many different countries.There were no hidden or extra costs and the checkout was easy and fast.Good option!!! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Nice suites great location good value dodgy service I first stayed here in 2003 when Shanghai was completely different. This month I was looking for somewhere to stay for 30 days so thought I would give it a go again, as my previous stay here had been quite good.I contacted the hotel directly and booked a one bedroom suite for 13,000 RMB for 30 days. That in itself is good value. The reception was efficient though not incredibly friendly. They gave me one of the newer suites on the 26th floor for which I was grateful and could see all the big buildings around People's Square from my window.The rooms are well furnished. The living room had very comfy brand new soft sofas, albeit of the Chinese size (i.e. a little small), and the dining area of the living room was of good size and the design well thought out. TV is something a little old and there is no DVD player. The lighting is just right. There is an air conditioning unit on the wall with individual controls which works very well indeed. Overall the living area is of a good to large size for a one bedroom suite.The bedroom was very nice with a fantastic king size bed with a foot thick matress which was just right for me. Not too soft, not too hard. They have clearly taken on comments about their previous hard beds, or maybe they exist only on the non-refurbished floors. The room has a large fitted wardrobe unit with more than enough space to put all your belongings. There is a separate air conditioning unit in the bedroom that works fine. There is an oddly located switch on the right side wall of the bedroom entrance. Common sense told me it was the light switch for the bedroom but it was the emergency panic button - so don't press it by mistake.Kitchen is small and basic and does not seem as new as the living room and bedroom. However it is perfectly functional with water dispenser/heater, cooker, microwave and large fridge freezer. Cutlery that was included were bowls, plates, knives, forks, chopsticks and errrm, a really really sharp meat cleaver. On request they also lent me a brand new iron and board.The bathroom again does not feel as new and refurbished as the living room and bedroom though is functional and of decent size. The sink unit is fine as is the large mirror though the lighting above it is extremely bright. They supply comb, tumblers and soap (in wall fixed dispensers). The bath is a little old and shallow and the plug opening mechanism did not work which meant after a bath I needed to get a knife and prise out the steel plug to drain the water, but that was a minor issue. Shower is above the bath and mixer, and of adequate pressure. Again, shampoo and soap are dispensed from the wall units. The toilet is fine but watch out for the dangerously located metal door stub which is placed right in front of the toilet, on which I hit my toe very hard. Kind of walked into it as I stepped to the toilet after closing the door. Overall, bathroom is functional thouh tiling and flooring is a little old.The broadband is good and reliable. Though please note this...since connecting to the hotel's network, my firewall blocked over four hundred intrusions over 30 days while my laptop was connected. If you want to plug in your laptop, absolutely make sure it is properly protected.The door and cleaning staff are very friendly indeed and very helpful. Same cannot really be said of the reception staff who, due to poor english, really could not deal with any issue other han check-in and check-out. Anything else baffled them including: ordering room service, requesting an iron, requesting a temporary residence form. On the latter, I simply had a nightmare as the little 20 year old guy on reception had no idea, and in the end said &quot;sorry I cannot help&quot; and disappeared leaving me standing at reception. Took my employer to shout at them in Chinese to finally sort it out (48 hours later).The room service food is extremely poor and expensive. I would not touch it again. The breakfast is okay but for 60 yuan you could get a better one elsewhere.In terms of location, it is only about 10 minute walk from People's Square which is perfect. The location can be called &quot;prime&quot; because it is so central.Be warned though, the &quot;Japanese Bar&quot; on the ground floor seems to be staffed with ladies, of let's say, questionable motive. I remember it was the same five years ago when I last stayed here. Idid go to the bar on the 2nd floor, and I could not see any staff and the bar was empty and looked quite depressing. Then found the barman sleeping underneath the bar. I walked up and he was still asleep so I left.Overall, an extremely well located, good value and comfortable hotel. If you want somewhere central to stay as a base, this is perfect. If youhave issues then best not to get reception to sort it out - try and get a friend to do it. Also, don't bother with the food here. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Best Value for the money! Keep coming back! Stayed in 2007-and came back. Great for families or traveling with friends. It is like a very simple,basic Holiday Inn in the US. Beds are hard-but that is typical in CHina-(just ask for another duvet and sleep on it for x-tra cushioning) This is not the Westin w/the&quot;heavenly beds&quot;!) Super location right in the midst of the local life,close walk to centralized People's square and other big hotels. (Pick up hotel card for taxi driver'sto find hotel-some cannot find-but cross streets are big and busy) Free brkfst has improved since the last time I stayed-there is more variety each day! Internet cheap,pool and fitness room very clean.Some rooms are newly renovated,and some are a little tired-but still decent. No kitchen utensils-buy across the street-big fridge to hold snacks and wine/beer cold-filtered H2Odispenser in kitchen. Individual A/C units in each room-maid will turn off during day. Front desk work very hard to help.(For those other reviews-typically the culture is very formal-&quot;smiling&quot;all the time-is not part of the Chinese service industry-efficiency and working hard is!) Careful about $ exchange at desk-often run out of money-need to come back later in theday-if one has more than1K-change at airport with a small commission fee.(Chinese banks-have long lines!)Map at desk is terrible-just walk into the big hotels in People's Square Radisson/LeMeridien/Ramada and pick up a better map at the concierge desk. (Blind Massage place around the corner(Green sign)-no frills place/dive-but for $6 for 45 minutes/fullbody/with clothes on-awesome!! Also, foot massage)Koreans,Japanese,Europeans,S.Americans stay here-Americans stick w/their familiar US hotel chains.This is an awesome deal-3people/3bedroom-$150 with breakfast-save your money for shopping! (You're not in the room all day!One is jetlagged anyway-so can get up and use the living room if sleeping is a challenge,without waking up others. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Excellent Hotel We have just returned from a 5 night stay in Shanghai. We booked the New Harbour Apartments based on the reviews and have no regrets. It was in a great location.It was a real experience being located among the locals but only a stone throw away from touristy things like the Shanghai Museum, Peoples Square. The hotel staff were v,friendly contrary to what i read on previous reviews. We stayed in a 3 bedroom superior room which was perfect and spacious, clean. We had no intention of cooking so there was no need to hire out equipment. The breakfast was westernised. We chose to walk to People square each day to get to the metro as its a 15min walk and you get a feel for how local life is. Crossing the roads were a nightmare, even if the green man is showing you are constantly dodging the cars...but bear in mind there are loads of people crossing. We had dinner in Epicure 45 which was v.nice approx £200.00 for 4 people but then on another night went to a chinese restaurant called 1221, which was recommended for £50.00 for 4 people and packed full of expats and airline staff. We all ate at this bavarian restaurant called Paulen, which was also v.nice but bear in mind all restaurants can be smoky so hope you get a table where nobody is not smoking heaps. We went across to the Pudong a couple times and went to JianMao for breath taking views and also the Oriental Pearl Tower. We had coffee in the Jian mao and were able to look up to the 87th Floor from the Hyatt Hotel Lounge.On one night we went to the Shanghai Acrobats Performance which is located in the posh side of Shanghai next to the Ritz Carlton Portman. This was a great night out , we had 200RMB seats - 4 rows from the front, it was similar to Cirque du Soleil at a fraction of the cost. Shanghai is a must see. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"A Must Stay So glad we stayed here. We were traveling as family with 2 teenage daughters &amp; booked a 3 bedroom apartment thru expedia. What great value &amp; location. Was a bit nervous after reading other reviews about staff attitude &amp; unhelpfulness but was pleasantly supprised. The bell boy greeted us on arrival &amp; helped with baggage, reception staff were pleasant and helped us throughout our stay with train bookings &amp; recommendations. And thankyou to the laundry girls on the 4Th floor. They let me use their machines for a tiny fee ( with 2 teenage girls i had lots of washing!!! ) The apartment was large &amp; clean with fantastic views - the water cooler was a big plus instead of the bottles of water you usually get. (We stayed on a high up floor so can't comment on other rooms). The breakfast in the restaurant was the usual and a bit crowded but the staff tried really hard and it was good value. The location was the best. You could walk everywhere if you wanted too ( although taxis are cheap). we walked to Nanjing Rd,The Bund, Yu Gardens &amp; Bazaar. The area around the hotel is really bustling and full of restaurants - go for a walk at night as it is fantastic. There is a supermarket across from the hotel but we prefered the little corner shop in the opposite direction.I have to mention the beds - Rock hard but my back said Yes Thankyou!!! I havn't been back to my Physio since I arrived back to Australia.Very happy too that Shanghai was out first stop instead of Beijing. My husband has been to China 3 times before &amp; he said we would shop more in Beijing. He was'nt wrong as we ended up buying 2 extra suitcases in Beijing. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"hidden gem I highly recommend this service apartment. My family of four stayed in a 3 bedroom, 2 bath apartment, which included a daily breakfast buffet for 3 (additional breakfasts around $9) for under $170 per night. At the front desk, there was always someone who spoke english. We were on the 19th floor - not much of a view, but the higher your floor, the softer the sounds of cars honking. The kitchen was small, but all we really needed was the microwave and refrigerator. No utensils or dishes. Dining room and living room to relax in. Tvs in both living room and master bedroom. Beds were firm, soft sheets, lots of pillows. Air conditioning units in each room. Bathrooms were clean and the water pressure was strong.It's located in a neighborhood near Renmin park a few blocks from the metro stop. I think there was only 1 taxi driver who knew where it was located, so be sure to carry their business card!!! We usually had them take us to the corner of Jin Ling and Yong Shou Roads and walked the 1/2 block. There's an internet cafe 1/2 a block away that charges 3 yuan/hour. Fresh dumplings are sold maybe 2 blocks away. Lots of seafood restaurants a block away. Very convinient! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Decent We chose this place because we were travelling as a family with 2 teenagers, needed space at a reasonable price. New Harbor Service Apartments served our purpose. It's quite centrally located, within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The apartment we got was pretty spacious, otherwise it's simple and basic...good enough especially because we only used it to rest after long days of sightseeing. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Central Location Great Value Stayed there for 4 nights in October. The hotel is near both People's Square / Nanjing Rd area and also walking distance to Xintiandi so it is convenient. Bund is a three min cab ride away. However, many cab drivers can't find it because it is in a side street that none of them know about. Best to have a map handy to show the cab driver.Place is clean. However, I had booked a nonsmoking room and got one that reeked of cigarettes. Nothing the nice housekeeper did could get rid of the smell. Sigh. That is the problem of traveling through China. Breakfast buffet is adequate for its purpose. Although seating is somewhat limited. Be prepared to share table with stranger if you are traveling alone.Price is reasonable. I would stay there again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"clean and very spacious Enjoyed a 5 night stay in a 3 bedroom deluxe apartment (25th floor) with my family. Very spacious apartment, 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, with combined lounge/dining area, and great views towards the Bund (during the few times when the smog cleared!). Very sparsely decorated though, no pictures on the wall or cushions on the sofa (which is what is shown on the website).I knew that the kitchen is not equipped (from previous reviews), but they don't even include a spoon to stir your tea/coffee which was a bit ridiculous! The green tea bags were free but you had to pay for little packets of coffee, so we went out and bought our own from the supermarket (lots nearby).The breakfast was passable but in my opinion not worth 60RMB. We had 3 coupons per day for the breakfast, so after the 1st day one of us passed on the buffet breakfast and just ate a local breakfast from one of the nearby eating places.Location was fantastic - we could walk to heaps of places including Yuyuan Bazaar, the Bund, Nanjing Rd, People's Park (the Shanghai Museum is well worth a look), Times Square, Xintiandi. Lots of cheap places to eat nearby, in and around Yunnan Street.Having a gym and indoor pool in the complex was an added bonus.Would recommend the apartments if staying for more than a few nights in Shanghai, as the extra space is fantastic. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"But I keep going back to it! You need to verify your information regarding the bed and size configurations when you reserve your room. The largest bed is 180 cm, followed by 150 and 130. This corresponds approximately to Queen, double and super single size. There are no King size beds. And by the way the beds are as hard as bricks, very uncomfortable but normal for China.We always bring our own camping pads to make them sleepable. My kids don't seem to care, but I do.The Superior two bedroom has a Queen and a double and is less expensive because the &quot;decorations are old&quot; meaning the furniture is older (but not disgusting) and often stinks like smoke. If you request nonsmoking rooms, they will air out the room before your arrival if possible. The Deluxe two bedrooms are above the 14th floor and and more expensive. The view and the relative quietness off the higher floors are worth the price difference. But they have &quot;new decorations&quot; meaning newer and unbelievably, even harder beds. The beds are also smaller, only a double and a twin. The windows in all rooms are single pane glass and the traffic noise on the lower floors can be substantial until about midnight. The curtains move in the breeze even when the windows are closed. We use the apartments often because we live in China and travel to Shanghai often. These are what offset the uncomfortable beds.......The Western breakfast is fair enough for the price and the pool is heated and quite nice. My kids like it and there is a lifeguard most of the time. There is a park with track for jogging that is fairly close by and the gym has two treadmills and an assortment of freeweights. There are microwaves, stoves(gas) with ovens and small refrigerators in each apartment (although I have never stayed in a single bedroom apartment so I don't know about those). Just caticorner to the New Harbor, there is a small local grocery store where you can buy ramen, cereals, milk, disposables like paper towels, bowls and plastic cutlery. Four blocks away is the Times Square shopping center with a City Supermarket in the lower level. Buy your ham, cheese or microwaveable pizza rolls there and save some money by eating in the apartment. YuYuan Garden, a beautiful photo op of ancient architecture, is a 10 minute taxi ride away and you can buy your teapots, fans, kites and all things China there. The bund is also 10 minutes by taxi. Peoples Square is two blocks away, as is the dinosaur museum that my kids love. The location justifies the cost so you need to modify your comfort expectations. At least there is room to spread out compared to other accommodations (in this price range) in the area. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great value! Felt like we lived in Shanghai vs. just visted! My family of 5 stayed here while we were in Shanghai for 4 days. It is situated in a local neighborhood not too far from the main Shanghai sites such as the Bund and Nanking Road. I loved it because it really gave me a feel of the city and not just the touristy spots. We had safe, fresh street food every morning for breakfast - all situated withing a 1 block radius! There's also a great street for dinner where you'll find an assortment of restaurants filled with locals within a block away. We had some of our best meals there: traditional hotpot, famous Shanghainese steamed dumplings and Uighur lamb kabobs (the best I've ever had!). Our apartment was on the 11th floor - great view! It was spacious with approx. 1,100 sq ft. - we were in a 2 bedroom, 1 bath space. For 5 adults, it was a treat to have more space than the usual hotel rooms though we did struggle with 1 bathroom. The only drawback since it is not a hotel but rather a serviced apartment is that there is less service. You do have your apartment cleaned every day - beds are made, bathrooms ar cleaned. However, the front deck staff is not entirely helpful. If you're looking for a day trip to one of the water villages near by (highly recommend Zhouzhuang dating back to the Ming and Ching Dynasties - it's where they filmed MI3), we were ripped off by the front deck folks who set us up with a private van costing 1,000 RMB when would could have gotten it for no more than 700 RMB. I'd recommend asking the laundry women for a private van since they seemed more sincere and told us afterwards that they could have gotten us one for much less. If you're looking for more than just a typical tourist's trip to Shanghai and are interested in exploring how the locals live, too, this is a great place for a great value! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"A Good Choice We only stayed here for one night, but were impressed with the standard of the apartment. Very spacious and has everything you need. Breakfast is great value at 60 RMB (about £4) per person. My only criticism would be that on check in/out the staff were not very friendly or welcoming, but not really an issue. Would stay here again, particularly if was in Shanghai for a few days as an apartment like this would feel like a great base. Good location too, 10 mins walk from People's Square. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good place to stay Myself and my husband stayed here for four nights at the beginning of October. We found it extremely satisfactory. We had a one bed apartment with sitting room, kitchen and bathroom. It was serviced very well each day and was clean and spacious. We are currently on a round the world trip and liked having the space in the apartment instead of just a small hotel room. We were also on one of the higher floors and had a great view of the city lights. There was a TV in the sitting room and the bedroom. Like another reviewer said, we found the supply of hot/cold water in the kitchen great-also for making cups of tea in the morning! True, if you want to self cater you do have to hire the crockery, cooking utensils etc but I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this when the food outside the door of the hotel is so cheap and yummy. It cannot be cheaper or easier to self cater. The location was excellent. A friend of ours lived in Shanghai for three years and she also said the location cannot be beaten. It is in a fairly local area so all of the nearby restaurants etc would not be tourist friendly in that no English menus etc but it's only a 10 min walk to more user friendly parts of Shanghai and it is nice to be in a local area to get a flavour for the real parts of the city. There is no WIFI in the rooms which was a bit of a minus for us but there is a business centre with two computers (although it is not cheap). There are also two restaurants which we did not use. All in all excellent value for the price-we paid 30 euro a head per night. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"had to leave don't believe the glowing reviews Selected this hotel/apartment based on trip advisor recommendations. Not so lucky this time. In the past we have stayed at great places based on trip advsior. This is the exception. Pictures looked good, beds were solid (like granite) Disturbed that housekeeping had to bring and charge for all items beyond a teacup. Ahh... the smell! Raw sewage and mould. Still coughing! Gas shutoffs are worrisome. Consider another location, had to leave, just couldn't stay. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"What a Great Stay! Three of us stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for 6 nights and had a great stay. The room was very clean, the shower was hot and drained well, and the apartment was large enough for us to sprawl out. Bottled hot/cold water in the kitchen came in very handy for making cups of tea. The location was fantastic- walking distance to the major sights and the People's Square subway station. The breakfast was great for us Americans, especially the fresh-cooked eggs and strong hot coffee. We would definitely stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Excellent location Loved this property. The location and price was just right! We booked a deluxe 1 bdrm with study apartment and had a computer ready and waiting when we arrived. The staff were very good and helpful. The western/chinese breakfast was good. We ate no other meals there. We are walkers and walked literally everywhere: Old Shanghai (25 minutes), Nanjing Road (10 min) the Bund and Pudong River for cruising by day or night (25 minutesJ). We would have walked faster but the weather was hot with high humidity, plus we had a 5 year old with a stroller. We would definately go back to Shanghai and stay at the same place. It was a comfortable, clean place to stay. Not too much english ... A grocery was across the street with anything you might want. Fresh fruit on the street. Laundry on the third floor. Our only drawback in Shanghai was the food. We survived well as having a kitchenette and a grocery near by. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good place but don't expect a full service hotel We stayed here for 4 days in the beginning of September and were satisfied with the hotel. Firstly, this hotel focuses on long term business clientel, not tourist. The hotel staff spoke good english and we had no problem checking in but when we asked them anything tourist related they didn't know the answer. However Shanghai was easy to navigate so this was not a huge problem. The rooms are old appartments, not hotels rooms. I had someone vouch that if you lived in Shanghai this is exactly what you can expect to live in (tiny kitchen and all). It is midway between the bund and the Shanghai Musuem so it is as central as you can get. The metro is about a 10 minute walk away. You could walk to french quarter (like we did) but I would highly suggest you go to the metro and go up a stop or two. Around the people square (where the musuem is) is a lot of shopping and restaurants. For the price it is a good deal. As a travellers note, if you are going to Beijing first, then Shanghai, do as much of your shopping in Beijing as possible as Shanghai is noticable more expensive in everything (if we were to do our trip again we would goto Shanghai first, then Beijing to avoid this problem). "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Decent Service Apartment We stayed 4 nights at the New Harbour Service Apartments. We arrived very early in Shanghai and was pleasantly surprised we were allowed to check-in at 8am without any additional charge. Receptionist was cheerful and check-in was a breeze. On our 1st night, we booked the deluxe 1-bedroom apartment. It was spotlessly clean, it came with a decent sized bedroom with a queen bed, plenty of wardrobe space and side-tables. The view wasn't much to look at as the city was pretty smoggy. The bathroom was clean and water pressure was strong. We had a small kitchenette with a small fridge, microwave and portable drinking water. In the fridge, soft drinks and beer were available, although at a price, the price-list was displayed on the kitchen cabinet. We shifted to a deluxe 3-bedroom from the 2nd night onwards as we had friends joining us a day later. The 3 bedder apartment is huge, came with a side table, dining table and large living room. 1 room would be the master-bedroom with attached bathroom, 2nd room was a normal sized room with queen bed, 2rd room was a room with a single bed. Everything was so new and our night-lamp was still wrapped up in plastic. There was a big attached bathroom near the living room. I was a little bit surprised that absolutely no utensils were provided in the kitchen, so if you want a cup of coffee, take it black or bring along a small teaspoon.The living room had a sofa, some potted plants, coffee-table and a tv. We could only find 2 English channels - HBO and Channel News Asia from Singapore. The bedroom and living room had separate air-cons so we had 2 remote controls, which were entirely in Mandarin, so if you can't read Mandarin and you have problem using the remote, you need to get help from reception.We were given bk'fast coupons and the buffet spread wasn't much to rave about. Very few selections although you had your breads, jams, butter, and local food like dim sum and noodles, however there was an egg station and they understood English, so you can order sunny side up or scrambled eggs. The staff there were very polite.The location of this service apartment was great! It was very near the Shanghai museum (which I recommend, it has 4 floors!), near the Bund, near the Yu Gardens which I absolutely loved and highly recommend! The bund is absolutely beautiful at night and the old buildings are just fantastic, you must take a night cruise down the bund and bring along your video-camera. The landmark of Shanghai which is the Pearl Orient Tower is also a must as you can see the whole of Shanghai (it reminds me of the Eiffel Tower). Keep your ticket stubs and you may want to visit the wax museum located on the 1st floor of the Pearl Orient Tower, it showcases old Shanghai and it has lovely old photos.Taxis are plentiful and the flag down rate is only 11 yuan. Although a local tells me that it's nearly impossible to catch a cab during summer and rainy days. A note of caution: if you flag a cab, be sure to be quick, we had our cab 'stolen' from under our noses by a local couple, we were waiting for the occupants to exit the cab and this couple walked right up and got into the cab, although it was clear we were waiting to get in. There are plenty of restaurants in Shanghai and prices are reasonably cheap. There are some al-fresco restaurants at the Bund (at the back of Shangri-La hotel) which is lovely, you get to enjoy the beautiful lights against the backdrop of those lovely buildings and see the ships cruise by. The only downside about Shanghai is the horrendous traffic, plan your itinerary early and try to avoid peak-hour as the traffic is really very bad, it's stop-go-stop-go...you get the picture. The ride from the airport took us over an hour to get to the apartment on arrival and we were caught in peak hour traffic.We took the 'MagLev train' (magnetic levitation) to the airport when we returned home. You have to experience it, it only took 7 minutes from the train station to the airport and only costs 50 yuan (keep your boarding stubs, if you show it to them, you only pay 40 yuan). This is a special train which goes to the airport in get this...330km/h. It sure beats sitting in a cab for an hour.Beware of 'spitters', there are quite a lot of them, so watch where you step. We found it pretty safe in Shanghai, the shopping was fantastic and taxis are plentiful in Autumn. Would definitely stay at New Harbour again if I ever visit Shanghai again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Shabby cheap unhelpful but good location Don't believe the website: our 1-bed deluxe apartment was small, and badly stocked: the kitchen had no cooking utensils, cutlery, crockery or kettle - even though they do provide two free teabags and two mugs. All can be hired for a fee, except the kettle, but what a pain - especially as housekeeping doesn't speak English and takes four calls and a 30m wait to get any item to the room. You rather wish they'd roll the extra $20 into the overnight price and be done with it.The checkin staff are surly; as per the other reviews, no luggage help is forthcoming at all (and I'm 5 months pregnant, struggling with two suitcases!). The apartment itself: stained, especially the bathroom, the furniture and fittings are cheap, tatty - very much like well-used student accommodation, in fact. Reasons to stay here? Good-ish space for your money, and centrally located, plus the A/C works fine. Our taxi driver took three turns round the block to find it, but it's walking distance to People's Square (which you can see from some windows). The surrounding streets look shabby, and are badly lit at night, but seem safe enough. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good value We were at the end of a 3 week trip to china with 3 kids. We opted for apartments to finish the trip and give us some freedom. We arrived ok but taxis did seem to struggle to find the place. Check in ok but not over friendly. The apartment had 3 bedrooms and a/c worked fine - nonce we got them to supply enough remote controls. Pool good - but we had 3 bedrooms for 2 adults and e kids and they charge extra if more that 4 people use pool - whic we thought was a bit much! Breakfast only for 3 people i.e. i per room - and no crockery or cutlery inh apartment - so cannot self cater unless you nbhire these. Howeverf overall good value. Near to peoples square and fairly central. Japanese restaurant attached - ok, good bar with helpful staff who recommended places to visit in shanghai. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Disappointing poor service This place was a bit of a disappointment, particularly in comparison to the other places we stayed. When we arrived, the bellboy stood watching us struggle with our luggage - no offer of help transporting our bags to the apartment was forthcoming, and I noticed that we were not alone in this. When we left, the security guard asked another bellboy to help and he refused outright. Reception staff varied from disinterested to rude, with the exception of one man. Our apartment did not in any way resemble the photos used to advertise this place - the view wasn't great but we were on the 5th floor and I imagine that had we been higher up it would have been fine, so I'm not complaining about that. However, the decor and furnishings were not quite as the pictures imply. The rooms have been recently decorated but the bathroom seems to have been only partially done, and the old tired wardrobes remain. Our safe didn't work and the kitchen is very pokey. The pool is also quite a bit smaller than it appears in the pictures.We had booked the apartment for 3 people but were only given breakfast vouchers for 2, and 2 towels. It took a few phone calls to get a third towel, and we couldn't extract an explanation as to why we were only entitled to 2 breakfasts even though the booking was for 3 - we gave up in the end. Breakfast was OK, not bad, not amazing, and service was poor.Location was reasonable, about 10-15 mins walk from Nanjing Street and 20 mins walk from the Old Town, but only if you are an enthusiastic walker. Found the staff so offensive that I wouldn't consider staying here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Location and Value We found New Harbour on Tripadvisor and were very happy with our choice. The reviews are very accurate. If you want a fancy, highend experience (spa, nice linens, crazy lobby) then this place definitely isn't for you. But if you plan on really seeing the city and want a nice place to sleep/rest then you'll find this hotel to be more than adequate.The location is awesome - right in the heart of town. My favorite was waking up and watching the locals go about their day. I think that's much more fun than seeing a bunch of tourists or westerners hanging around! Taxis did have a little trouble with finding it, but we made it there safely and quickly every time. Breakfast was great - nice mix of local and western foods. Front desk is not very helpful, but the doormen were wonderful. Steve even walked us a few blocks to find a sim chip for our cell!Someone mentioned it being smelly and that is slightly true. It's all the humidity and it smells like dampness. Nothing gross, just a tad off.Overall, it's no Four Seasons but definitely met our needs. We'd stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great location I spent three nights in July 2007 in a superior 1 bedroom suite for 1539rmb, including service and internet access. Superb location and rooms for the price. The decor is a bit shabby and the bed is very firm but not uncomfortable. No cooking facilities in the one bedroomed apartment but a nice sitting room.Breakfast was a hit or miss affair, some days excellent other days a waste of 60rmb. A bit expensive considering you can get an all you can eat lunchtime bbq in Xiantiandi for 68.The gym is typical for a hotel but the pool and sauna area are very nice.I would definitely stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"good value good location This was a good value and well located. As a family of 4, having more space was very nice--only 1 bathroom, though. It also had relatively inexpensive high speed internet and a nice, athough somewhat expensive, breakfast as additional costs. We had little trouble with cabs knowing how to get there as some had reported. All in all, it was a satisfactory experience. It was clean and well maintained (except my only real complaint was the windows were very dirty outside). We had a great view but had to open the window to enjoy it!! I would definitely stay there again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Good value for money Just back from a three night stay at New Harbour. Location is great and apartment was good value for money. However we found the reception staff unfriendly and not very helpful - that said it may be becuase they were always quite busy. One thing to watch out for is that the reception don't exchange sterling - either notes or travellers cheques. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Value for money Hotel is located about 10 minute walk to nanjing road. You will have to wake trough a bit fusy part of town but we did not have a problem with that. By the way we used a taxi maybe 25 times and did not pay more then 20 yuan, about 2 euro, 2,5 dollars... So that's no problem. Since you are in the middle of downtown everything is within a few KM (or miles).All rooms are apartement style and we had booked a 2 and a 1 bedroom deluxe. We got a 3 and 2 bedroom deluxe. Rooms are average, not thrills but they worked our fine. Kitchen is nothing to talk about and all kitchenware needs to be rented (no need on holiday).Breakfast is good, buffet with everything you need. Staff speaks a little english. Hotel was being renovated as we were there, we did not notice any noice or so.I would recommand it to anyone needing a comfortable, great value hotel in the center of Shanghai. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Excellent hotel - value and location The New Harbour Service Apts. provided terrific value (approx. $750/week for our family of 4). The 3-bedroom suite was spacious, had two bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room and living room, two cable TV's, air conditioning, and internet. The hotel is centrally located. It's within 10 minutes of The Bund, major upscale shopping and dining, to the shopping bazaar and tea gardens, and to Renmin Park (Shanghai Museum and Shanghai Art Museum). The hotel also has a fitness center and pool. Breakfast for 3 was included: they serve Western and Asian food; the 4th breakfast cost a reasonable 60 RMB per day (about $8) The staff speaks passable English, meaning we never had a problem being understood, even when asking for an iron, for directions on how to open the bedroom safe, or for a new internet cable. We highly recommend this hotel! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Smelly hotel poor staff but good location We stayed at New Harbour in a 2 room suite. On arrival we were shown to an uncleaned room that smelt awful after complaining they &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a 2 room suite which while clean also smelled awful. The rooms are big with losts of room but the furniture is tired and useless.The front desk staff is the dour chinese type who prefer to avoid eye contact and hide in the back room with a few excpetions. The doorman are great and very eager to get a cab.The breakfast buffet is OK - quality varied tremendously from day to day.The location is good - everything is a short cab ride away. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Stay We stayed at the New Harbour Serviced apartments while on a recent holiday in China. Our stay was for a total of 4 nights and we were amazed and what quality is on offer for such a low price. Location:The location is spot on perfect with the Yuayuan tea rooms, the bund, the french concession, peoples square, xintande and huahai shopping district all within walking distanceRooms:We opted for the executive suite as the prices are so cheap and it was well worth it with separate kitchen, a dining table, lounge and also a separate study with your own PC and internet access. The rooms were great and roomy and the bedroom was big.Service:We did have problems trying to communicate what we wanted to the staff but after a bit of effort we did get our message across.Overall: You cant beat basically staying in what is a studio apartment for the incredibly low rates being charged ( i think we payed somwhere in the vicinity of $100-120 Aus per night) especially when we hardly ever had to jump in cab as we could walk everywhere. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Excellent home base I booked a 2 bedroom apartment (for 3 people) for about $100 per night. When we arrived they upgraded us to a 3 bedroom place so I can't speak for the 2 bedroom units but ours was very nice. Big living room, dining room, nice bedrooms, 2 bathrooms with good showers, very clean, nice view, good air conditioning, good daily cleaning service. And the beds were softer than anywhere else we had stayed in China, quite comfy. Note, this is not a luxury hotel, the furniture is not expensive and the floor is fake wood. But it is all clean and nice and comfortable. As long as you don't go in expecting Ritz quality you will not be disappointed.The kitchen is small but we didn't want to cook anyway. It had a water cooler with purified bottled water which was a great feature, and a fridge. No cooking equipment but they will rent that stuff to you for cheap if you want it. The gym in the hotel is quite nice, and they have internet use for a reasonable price at a few public computers. The hotel breakfast was bad and we didn't eat there after trying it the first day but there is plenty of yummy food just steps away from the front door.We thought the location was ideal - walking distance to Old Town and the Bund (if you don't mind walking a mile). Very close to People's Park. And taxis are so cheap it's easy to get around. Plus there is a subway stop at People's Park and the subway system is very nice, clean, and reasonably easy to use.Front desk staff spoke very good English and were quite helpful. Overall we were not very fond of Shanghai compared to other places in China - too much neon and American shops and commercialization but we had fun and really liked the hotel. Highly recommended, especially if you have more than 1 person or a couple and want additional bedrooms. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great hotel! Great hotel at a great price. Excellent location, staff spoke good English, clean and friendly. Far better value than the big brand hotels, with not that much less in terms of amenities. Highly recommended. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"excellent choice Appts are in a great location . . being between reminin square and the metro link and the styley xitandi area (good restaurants) Hotel was only a short walk to both areas so was ideal. Staff where polite and helpful - rooms clean and large - beds hard but typical of other aisian hotels I've stayed in. Nice pool area. Breakfasts were also very good with excellent choice (Bacon, saus, hash browns eggs done how every you like plus the usual cereal toast etc) Will absolutley recommend to anyone else (in fact my Mum's is going to stay next week !) "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Place Hotel was in excellent location about 1 km to The Bund, Old China andNinjing Road. We had booked a 3 bedroom &quot;superior&quot; suite but on arrival that was not available for some reason and they put us ina 2 bedroom and a 1 bedroom suite which was fine. The 2 BR was a smoking room but they could not or would not change it claiming the hotel wasfull. Did offer to try to change the following day though after I pushed the issue. Over all the staff were cordial and generally friendly and spoke good english but I wouldn't say they went overboard in the service e.g. didn't seem to know how to smile. The rooms were fine (once we got rid of the smoking) and clean. Great views (we were on the 23rd floor). We did have suites so not sure what the &quot;normal rooms&quot; were like. The beds were rock hard which was the only bad mark I could give. TV was ok with mix of English (CNN, HBO, ESPN) and Chinese channels. Business centre on 2nd floor so you could easily catch up on news from home via internet.Restuarant provided a good western style breakfast but would not recomend for evening meal. Plenty of Chinese restuarants nearby as alternative. Also a small supermarket across the road so you could get your own supplies. All up, enjoyed my stay at the hotel and wouldgo back again. There were 4 of us, myself, wife and 2 late teenage children and we were comfortable. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Loads of room Two adults, 1 child and toddler stayed in the 2 bedroom deluxe for 10 days - hard beds were a bit of a shock, but apparently they are common in China. My bad back actually got better being straightened out every night! The cot was supplied with bedding free of charge. There was plenty of space for all of us. The staff were very helpful and would write the name of our destination in Mandarin for the taxis. Taxi's did find it a bit hard to find hotel as its between two one way streets, but the hotel provides a map in chinese on business cards which made it easier. Plus the taxis are keen not to rip you off (as long as you take a genuine taxi and not a private car with meter in glove box). We organised our trip directly with the hotel (via phone calls and then emails to confirm details). We negotiated and even lower rate as we were staying 10 days. The only problem was we arrived at around 9pm and the hotel gave away our room and put us in a slightly smaller one. But after pointing this out we got upgraded to a superior room with even more room and an extra toilet at no extra charge. Also, use the external laundry - much better quality and value for money than having housekeeping do it in house. Pool was also clean, but not super warm!! Would stay again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Tremendous value Tremendous value in excellent location between The Bund and Renmin Park. Great views over the city from 26th floor. Good breakfast buffet. Staff helpful though quite dour. Plenty of space for the money. Beds hard!In-house bar rather tacky but some really interesting eateries round about; try Yunan (food) street for an adventure. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good location We booked 3 nights at the hotel to end our trip round China. We found the staff friendly. The suite was clean and more than adequate for our stay. It is not luxurious but perfect for what we needed. It is quite conveniently located if you don't mind walking a little, however taxi's are so cheap that it doesn't matter if you don't want to walk.The food in the hotel was basic but very nice, although the breakfast were a little dissapointing. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Great for a family or group A group of 5 adults and one baby shared the 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in comfort. It was spacious and kept very clean with daily servicing. A cot (travel-cot type) was provided at no charge. The location is good as there are plenty of restaurants and food stalls around with a mini mart right across the street. You can walk to Nanjing Lu and Xintiandi in about 20 minutes. If you feel lazy taxis are very cheap. We had a great view towards the Peoples Square. 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Fantastic for families First 2 nights given low-floor superior room with 2 queen sized bed.Musky smell carpet,otherwise okay.room rate for 2-bedroomed suite+3 breakfasts daily=one room hotel room downtown.On return from Hangzhou,upgraded to delux 2-bedroom suite as all superior rooms taken,much nicer higher floor,no smell,overlooking People,s Sq.Breakfasts very good,esp coffee,since usually coffee in China elsewhere tastes like milky water.This apt 's coffee tastes and smells like expresso. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"overall good experience I booked this hotel via hotels.com and got a very good price. I payed around 890 dollars for 6 nights in a three bedroom apartment. There was one big livingroom with tv, sofa and two armchairs plus a kitchentable for six, two normalsized bathrooms with tub, three bedrooms and one small kitchen. Two of the bedrooms slept two people (one queensize bed in the first and two singlebeds in the second). We were five people (one family with five adults) and the apartment suited our needs perfectly. The kitchen was not equipped with anything in terms of cups, glasses, plates or cutlery. If you want any you have to rent it from the hotel. Since there are thousands of great restaurants in the neighborhood we really didn't need the kitchen anyway. The beds were very hard but that is normal in China and we all slept very well anyway. Also, the apartment was very quiet.The apartment was pretty cold since january is a winter month in Shanghai. We heard that Mao Tse Tung actually decided that south of the Yangtse river, no heating would be installed in the buildings, and for some strange reason the Shanghainese still don't install heating in their buildings. Luckily every room had air conditioning so if you have the A/C on (we put it on 25 degrees celcius) you don't have to freeze.Overall good location. About three minutes walk to Huaihai Rd, one of the biggest shopping streets. A taxi ride to People's Square, the Bund, Pudong etc is about 12-19 RMB (1.5-2.4 US Dollars) and there are always taxis available so getting around is cheap and easy.The condition of the apartment was okay, a little tired in some corners but nothing too bad considering the very low price and great location. New towels and cleaning every day. 3 free breakfast coupons each day (the breakfast is 50RMB for those without coupon). The breakfast was good with juices, omelettes made especially for you, toast, fresh fruit and chinese dishes for those who like to try new things. Some of the staff spoke english so language was no problem.I would definately stay here again. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Nice I think the thing that makes this hotel excellent was the sheets. I honestly don't get the traditional gross sheet set up. There was a nice goose down comforter with a white duvet cover. The pool was nice considering you're in middle of the city. Everything was very convenient, many good restaurants very close by if you are looking for chinese cuisine. Also close by is reming square, shanhai museum, huahai and nanjing, the best places to shop. There is a nice view of the city at night and during the day. It is clean enough. It is good alternative to large foreign chains that charge excessively to uphold their upscale brand. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great place at a good value we stayed at a 2 room apartment for 4 nights. very clean and tidy. The kitchen was quite small and useless and also had no utensils. But if you eat out all the time like we did, shoulnd't be a concern.the location was quite good and was right next to the major food street in shanghai. i think it was yunnan st.the location is quite ok but it's bit far to walk to all the major sights and had no close metro station. But as the taxi is quite cheap in china, so should be ok. the breakfast buffet is excellent and not to be missed but avoid having dinner in the restaurant. My friend ordered spaghetti and it came with sweet and sour sauce instead of tomato!!!overall, i will highly recommend this place "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"location-price-quality combination hard to beat Booked this in Nov 06 through Expedia - this gives an excellent discount if booked together with the flight. Called them a day before, was immediately connected to an English-speaking assistant who confirmed the booking and immediately agreed for an early check-in.A nice high-rise in an area, which otherwise is somewhat dull, but safe and with a good number of services (shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc) nearby. The big advantage is that this is in roughly equal distance from all major attractions: Bund, Xitiandi/Frenchtown, Old town, Nanjing shopping area, People's Square. You can get to any of these on foot within reasonable time, or if you are tired of walking, by cab for 11 yuan (~1euro/70pence) in most cases. Taxi to/from the airport was 45 minutes/150 yuan. Taxi drivers don't usually know this place so printing out a map with address from their website in advance will be helpful.We had a 'delux' suite on the 22nd floor, which was clean, quite spacious, air-conditioned (separate units for the bedroom and lounge), with tv, wc, bath with shower, hairdryer and enough furniture for a small family: double bed, sofa, armchair, dining table with 3-4 chairs, coffee table, and plenty of storage for clothes in the bedroom. Kitchen is a separate small room with large fridge, gas cooker, microwave, sink and a water dispenser.Kitchen utensils you have to rent - we got a kettle for an occasional cup of tea, but could not get the cooker to work (so we microwaved water instead). We did not bother much about this, but I imagine it could be more important for anyone with kids or if staying for a longer time - then you would really like to cook for yourself. I'm sure they would fix it though, as they promptly reacted to our other requests, we just did not care to go and ask.Another strange thing about the kitchen was that the water in the complimentary watertank was for some reason heated, not cooled - I could not find any button to change this, so the water was warm (but not hot enough for tea) all the time. Perhaps I should have unplugged the whole thing.The furniture and decor are occasionally mildly dated but otherwise make an impression of new and well-maintained. Hard flooring was a very nice difference from the usual Anglo-American fitted carpet with all its grease, stains and dust (have a sniff in the '5-star' Peace Hotel, for example, to understand what I mean). The maid service is efficient, they really scrub the place clean every day.The best thing was to have a real apartment with more than one rooms and windows with different views, instead of being locked in a 'single cell' confinement, however luxurious that might be. Being able to rest when your partner is watching TV or working in the other room is also essential for a jet-lagged traveler. Most serviced apartments I stayed in before compromise on service in some way: they would provide cleaning only once a week and will frequently charge you for a final cleaning; they almost never have typical hotel facilities. This is not the case at the New Harbour though: you get daily cleaning at no extra charge, 24/7 reception service, swimming pool with sauna, business centre with Internet PCs, breakfast (good), 2 restaurants (decent), a bar (hugely overpriced), fridge with drinks (cheap) and hairdressers (good and very cheap).Breakfast is included for one person, for more people you have to pay 50 yuan (5euro/3.3pounds) per person - very reasonable for the varied and substantial fare (both Chinese and European) you get there.Most staff speaks some English, so we did not have many problems with this. They are not overly friendly but are sufficiently efficient.Among the glitches, I already listed the gas cooker thing (they didn't seem to charge for the kettle though). Another mild problem was with all PCs using Chinese version of Windows - which means you don't know which button to click to stop the thing from saving your passwords. One PC in the business centre seemed infested with spyware throwing up cascade windows so it might not be wise to type in any sensitive information there. Also, I tried to follow their instructions to connect to the Internet by dial-up from the room but this did not work. They offered an ethernet cable for 70 yuan a day which I did not take as I only needed to check my mail couple times, so I can't say how good this is.In a nutshell, having seen the different areas of Shanghai, I think this is a very good option in terms of price, location and quality. I think it would be even more valuable for anyone who opts for self-catering holidays there. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,Excellent value Excellent value for money and quite well situated- the apartment was spotlessly clean and even offered inclusive internet. Great for families. Reception was ok although english of staff was limited. Good laundry facilites - altogether a very successful stay.Some breakfasts included in price - a good selection of chinese and western food -I will definitely come back to this accommodation 
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Clean Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-September (actually, I was booked to stay for a week, but my plans changed and they accomodated my change). I booked a 1-bedroom unit, but upon check-in, they ran out and gave me a 2-bedroom for the same price. The room is well laid out and clean. Bed is not as hard as indicated by another reviewer - typical type of bed in China. The location is convenient - a quick walk to Huai Hai Road and to Xin Tian Di. The immediate surrounding of the hotel is more of a &quot;local area&quot;. They have internet access to the rooms and in the business centre, but they charge extra for that. The breakfast provided is okay, nothing great. Definitely value for your money. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good value Good points:Convenient location - many resturants within walking distance;Staff are helpful and honest (I left a skirt in the wardrobe, it was returned to me when I was checking out);Thorough room cleaning everyday; Not so goods points:Beds are extremely hard, hope they can add a pad to it if the beds are not to be replaced soon;Bedroom carpet is very dirty, hope it can be replaced by wood floor as living room;Breakfast can be better; Try to eat out as much as you can.

The breakfast was cheap and good , the restaurant was expensive for China and not good! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great base to explore I have just come back from a week in Shanghai staying at the New Harbour.Firstly it is easy to find if you go into town on the Maglev (50RMB - Worlds fastest train – was a buzz) then get the underground (2RMB and well air-conditioned) to Peoples Square. From there turn right out of exit no. 1 walk along the park near the shops – go over the pedestrian overpass (you can see the New Harbour lit up towering over other buildings – it has 28 floors) and it was just a few streets walk – we managed the airport to hotel room in 1 hour, after about 12 hours of flying, with luggage fairly easily). If you are getting a taxi it is easier for the driver to find Jinling Dong Lu (Jinling Road East – it is full of musical instrument shops!) Yonshou Road and the hotel are just off Jinling.I stayed with a friend in a one bedroom Superior Suite – which is the basic room on the 7th floor. It had a good size living room with sofa and easy chair plus a desk and chair. It also had a TV with loads of channels – mainly Chinese and Japanese but also a number of English speaking ones – well CNN and HBO. It had a microwave and huge fridge freezer (stocked as a mini bar but also with things like Chinese pot noodle and coffee – cheapest mini bar I have ever seen too!). The bedroom was large enough – we had a twin (yes ahrd beds to good for your back !) – with a massive wardrobe and another TV – with an en suite with everything you need – great shower that was well appreciated after the long flight. Both rooms had air chillers on the walls which was bliss – was 35 degree Celsius plus outside and 95% humidity – and the only way you can get cool enough to sleep. The hotel was a great place to come back to after a long day exploring the city in the heat. The location was just fine – on the edge of the Bund and Nanjing Road shopping areas, on the edge of the Old Town, just down the road from the start of the French Concession (Gods Kitchen has a massive super club about 10 mins in a cab in this area) and the Renmin Park. So perfect for us as we explored every day on foot. It is also on the edge of the new area so you see a bit of daily life for the locals which is great to watch if you are not on too high a floor. They are especially great to watch on crossings – everyone going in different directions – but no one bumps into each other! And people sitting out in the street in the cool of the night.The staff at the front desk are efficient but not overly friendly – which make a nice change from the overly cheesey American hotel reception staff! (Though we found people in Shanghai very friendly and chatty.) We got a taxi back to the airport coming back due to very early flights – reception sorted a taxi out and he was great! They’ll also post your cards for you so no need to get stuck in the post office for ages trying to pronounce the word stamp!The pool looked great but we didn’t have time to use it. The Japanese restaurant attached to the hotel is also good and cheap for a first arrival night meal – we paid about £9 for 2 main dishes and 2 beers and green tea (the later is free in all restaurants except the airport!). Also check out the bakery round the corner called Relax if you miss breakfast – which finishes at 10 am (we missed it every day!) or the bakery on Jinling Road – but believe your eyes – we were persuaded to buy a weird cake with a furry top – it looked weird, had too much chilli for a breakfast and smelt bad. The buns with almonds are great though. There is a supermarket outside the front to the left which has loads of great stuff.The water cooler in the room is a god send – we drank 2x11.3litre barrels in 6 days just while we were in the room – and much more out and about. It does hot and cold water – the switch is on the back to heat up the water for tea or noodles – which takes a bit of finding. It is also free to get more even though it says in the room portfolio you have to pay for additional barrels – you don’t.Yunnan Road round the corner is a great food street – plenty of interesting sights too. Nanjing Road is about 10 mins walk away – but so is the Old Town in the opposite direction, where is it essential to haggle – we bought most stuff for around 50 to 60% of the market prices- sometimes less!Essential very good suite hotel with enough space. Would definitely stay again! "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"execellent price/quality We, a family of 4 with children aged 9 and 10, stayed for a week at New Harbour. It´s an execellent place for families. The apartments are spacious, clean and well equipped (exept for the kitchen which is empty). The gym is OK and the large swimming pool a daily attraction for the kids. Breakfast was allright although the place was too small so at times people got breakfast in the hallway.Staff was friendly. It´s an excellent location, only 5 minutes walk from renmin square and all the shopping malls and 5 minutes form the chinese shops in the old town. A 15 minute stroll will get you at the Bund.The largest appartment (up to 5 people) is less then 100 euro per night including breakfast. So it´s a much better deal then the comparable 4 star hotel´s. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Good for families - okay location Just got back from Shanghai. We stayed at the New Harbour for several days. The location is pretty good - a 10 minute walk from Yu Yuan Gardens, 5 minute walk to Huai Hai Lu and a 10 minute walk to Nanjing Dong Lu. There is nothing much around the hotel (within 3-4 blocks). People's park is about 5 blocks away as is the metro. Breakfast is great - a plentiful buffet of western and Chinese foods.The pool is also very nice - not luxurious but very nice.Front desk staff is fluent in English, but seems a bit understaffed at key times (they are always in a rush).We would recommend this hotel in the future. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"pleasant stay at the New Harbour I stayed at the New Harbour from May 29th to June 4th.The hotel is very well located-within easy access of the Bund, the YuYuan Gardens, the French Concession and the old Chinese area. The room had air-conditioning and was very spacious -double bed, sofa, easy chair, large desk,fridge,microwave ,some dishes (minus utensils) and water cooler. It was clean and bright and overlooked a small park . A buffet breakfast provided a very good start to your day; it offerred a variety of dishes (fresh fruits, cereals, breads, eggs, tea/coffee/milk/juice plus some hot dishes etc.) Those at the front desk were pleasant enough and had a pretty good command of English.They will provide you with a free and useful map of the city if you ask.Getting around the city by metro is possible but not that practical. There are not many subway stations so it meant a fair walk (at least 20 minutes) to get to them. ( Shanghai with a population of around 18 million has a subway system of about 50 stations-they are presently extending it- while Seoul with a similar population has an extensive system of over 250 stations!) Buses might have been a better way to get around but few people speak English and there are very few signs in English so using the bus was not an option. (If I were to return to China I would want a map of the bus routes.) Taxis are inexpensive.The touristy area around the Yu gardens is worth a visit-lots of very reasonable souvenirs. Nanjing road was also a nice surprise.I recommend getting tickets to the Acrobat show at the Portman Ritz-Carlton complex.The area is very modern, the hotel is huge,modern and obviously a place where the wealthy stay. It was raining heavily that day and I looked like a drowned rat when I picked up my ticket but nevertheless was treated very well by the staff at the hotel while I waited to enter the theater.Also, be prepared to bargain-it seems to be expected at a lot of places. I found the ordinary Shanghai resident more than willing to try to help out with directions and that having a map which had streets printed in both Mandarin and English was most useful. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great Apt Hotel Good Prices I really enjoyed Shanghai and one of the reasons was the New Harbour Serviced Apartments . We got a three bedroom apt perfect for five people since there were three rooms. One room had a queen, another a 2 double beds, and the third room had one double. We had a nice sized living room with adjacent dining room. Small kitchen but since we didn't do any cooking it was perfect just to store fruits and drinks. They had no utensils but you can rent some during your stay. Rooms were bright and we had a nice view of the surrounding roof tops &amp; buildings. The rooms and the 2 bathrooms were cleaned each day. Hotel provided a decent breakfast buffet (bread, eggs, fruit, cereal) for three individuals for a triple room otherwise it was USD $6 per person. The best breakfast I had was the noodle soup restaurant across from the hotel. It's the only one that sells pre-made fried fish behide a glass window for those who prefer to eat them at home. Hotel was nicely situated. It was a ten minute walk away from Nanjing Road and close to the Bund. Only difficult thing is that if you don't know Mandarin to explain to the taxi drivers where the hotel is located, it takes a while to get back. The hotel provides a business card with a map of where the hotel is but some taxi drivers don't know how to read so just be patient until you find one who does. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Terrific place for families If you have kids, then above all, you'll want a hotel that gives everyone a place to relax and recharge, whether in a common space or in private areas.I spent almost a week with a five-year-old and it was good to have everyone have their own bedtime (in a single room, when the first person goes to sleep, the room goes dim and quiet). Some quick notes:* Rooms are high if plain* Breakfast was convenient if unspectular* Pool and gym were nice enough* Location was not awful but 10 minute walk from everything* Staff was goodSo bottom line: nothing spectular but great value for a suite hotel; highly recommended for families. I will come back. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Not bad at all The facilities were nice and clean. If you want to use the kitchette, you have to rent the utensils though. Be warned, if you are from the west, you are most likely used to soft beds but the beds in Asia are hard and this is particularly so in Shanghai. Also, Shanghai is a smokers haven. Although my room was designated a 'non-smoking' as well as the floor, there were ash trays everywhere in the room. The buffet was okay, but not a large spread by any means. In terms of location, you are about 5 blocks (5 minute walk) to the pedastrian walk.Personally, I would check out the Central hotel, which was about the same money but in a PRIME location. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Just a little additional information In so far as the New Harbour Serviced Apartment is concerned, I basically agree with the comments from the reviewer on January 11, 2006. Good value, good location, clean apartments and hardish beds (which didn't bother me at all after the first few minutes). But the service apartment has no utensils except a couple of cups and glasses. It doesn't even provide a teaspoon or a knife and fork or plates so bring your own if you want to cut some fruit or make a sandwich or make a cup of tea. The front desk speaks english so it's ok. Just want to add some further information about New Harbour Serviced Apartments, in particular about that the deli street the reviewer refers to. I think he/she might mean Yunnan street. Seems to have lots of food, but particularly a little corner store selling barbecue mutton skewers. Those guys are from Sinkiang and look eurasion but their skewers were yummy and cheap (2 yuan per skewer which works out to be about 20 US cents). There's always a little crowd around them. There were other restaurants around but I didn't get a chance to try them as we were being hosted. if you are looking for some nice restaurants you can also try the following:1) Ye Olde Shanghai Station restaurant serving high quality Shanghainese food. Its a refurbished old shanghai train station. Not cheap by Shanghai standards. A meal for 4 with about mid sized 6 dishes came up to more then 550 Yuan.2) I highly recommend Ba Guo Bu Yi, located at Ding Xi Road and Zhao Hua Road. The food in this Szechuan restaurant is authentic (so be warned, the food is spicy) and cheap. A meal for 4 adults with good sized dishes (3 cold dishes and 4 hots dishes and a bottle of traditional chinese yellow wine) came up to 450 yuan or approximately US$55. But even better then the good value and delicious food is that the restaurant puts on a show, an artform traditional to the Sze chuan province where the performer is able to change his masks rapidly. The show lasts for about 10 minute and is worth seeing. The phone number 13524605236 (ask to speak to Ms Yang).3) Also, go see the Shanghai acrobatics show if you have children. The show is good and the reception can give you the written directions.Taxis are relatively cheap and the drivers are pretty honest. All will use the meter. Teh restaurants recommended above are in Shanghai and if the traffic is good, shouldn't cost more then 25 - 30 Yuan to get to them from the New Harbour Serviced Apartments. "
new harbour serviced apartments ,"Great value and location I booked this hotel because it meant my mother and I could stay in the same apartment with separate bedrooms but pay far less than we would have done for two hotel rooms. It also meant we could spend evenings in comfort watching TV (satellite) together in the living room area. I do sometimes wonder what people expect for their money. This hotel provides very good sized accommodation in a great location at a price that anyone would consider a snip. While it is not glamorous in the fashion of a 5 star hotel, it still provides a level of convenience and comfort that most hotel rooms don't. To be able to make tea or coffee, or to cook or make sandwiches any time one wishes is a real pleasure. It feels far more like a home from home than any hotel room. There is also a very good pool and leisure facility and a self service laundry. The breakfast buffet is a mixture of chinese and western food and the restaurant offers a reasonably priced menu throughout the day for lunch or dinner. The staff have varying standards of english comprehension, but you get by and they are very efficient for getting taxis at any time. There is a small supermarket opposite and a bakery and greengrocer round the corner. The hotel is really convenient for taking a taxi across the river to Pudong as it is not far from the tunnel under the river. Ask for a room high up and the views are excellent, particularly if you can get one facing People's Square. So, if you want a high priced but plush looking hotel room where you have to sit on a bed to watch TV then fine. Personally I prefer somewhere to spread with a comfortable living area to sit, socialise and watch TV when I want to relax. While some taxi drivers do have trouble knowing where the hotel is, if you ask for the card provided by the hotel regarding taxi reservations, on the back it actually has a map showing its exact location in chinese.

novotel atlantis shanghai ,excellent hotel the room are very well equiped and very clean ; the decoration is nice and the bed is very confortoable. This is really a top hotel and the area is nice for small shops and restaurant where you can eat typical chinese food. the hotel is nevertheless far from the city center but with cab this is not too much of a problem. Breakfast buffet is amazing and provide a great choice of excellent products 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,Modern Hotel excellent value. Couldn't fault the Novotel Atlantis. A very modern hotel with excellent amenities and friendly helpful staff.The rooms were very spacious well kept and clean.The hotel is within walking distance of the train station. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if visiting Shanghai again in the future. 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Good hotel let down by poor lighting in bathroom Stayed here 1 night on the 37th floor. Big flat screen TV but no BBC (is it coincidence that it is a French hotel chain!) – no Sleep facility. Separate purpose-built spacious shower and bath. Very poor lighting in bathroom, particularly in front of mirror over sink. Not 5 star, but certainly 4 star.Revolving restaurant on 50th floor – excellent views over Shanghai – where had a seafood buffet. Part of hotel seemed to be closed – descended from lift and found ourselves in the deserted part with two bemused security guards looking at us. They soon gestured us out of the building and into the main street where, after 10-20 metre walk, we were soon back in the main hotel. Glorious view over Shanghai from hotel room. Despite being so high up, lifts were very quick.About 40 minutes from the Pudong international airport (150 yuan by taxi). "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,Very nice hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 11 nights. we had very nice and big room. there is a free internet in all rooms in this hotel. rooms were cleaned every day. the hotel has a nice swimming pool with a view to the city. Also there are some good restaurants.You can catch a taxi to go to the city center. Or use a metro which is 4 minutes walk from the hotel. 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Overall a very good hotel I stayed here for 2 nights before heading back to Canada from a 4 week trip of China &amp; Malaysia. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect but what I found exceeded my expectations. We arrived on the red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur and much to our surprise, we were able to check in right away (9am). Also, we were given free internet access (which was not included in the price) &amp; late checkout without any hassles. The hotel lobby was nice and spacious.I must say, the service was impeccable. Housekeeping was already in our room before we arrived to set up the rollaway bed and provided lots of extra anemities without being asked. We got a corner room which was more spacious and even with an extra bed, there was lots of room for our suitcases. The only downside is the location. It's in the business district of Pudong and not even close to a subway station. The nearest one was at least a 15 min walk away which seems like an eternity when it's over 40 degrees outside. You definately need to take a cab to get anywhere. Luckily there was a Starbucks next door which was handy.In all, I was very satisifed with this hotel and would stay here again. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,Basic business hotel very basic business hotel. decent clean rooms. in the heart if pudong. 10 min away from thr maglev to shanghai airport. reasonably priced. starbucks in the adjoining lobby.. 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Very good hotel Been at that hotel for 4 days. Hotel's allure is great. The restaurants are interesting and serve good choices and tasty cuisine. Service is quick and with a smile. Location is not an issue. From Pudong airport, taking high speed train + taxi = 30 minutes max. This way, you avoid the cranky taxis. Internet in the room works well. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Nice modern unpretentious hotel I liked it a lot. Modern, efficient hotel with good health club facilities. Well located for Pudong business area. I am becoming a fan of this brand. Nice looking restaurants on site. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,Novotel Atlantis Shanghai I stayed at the Novotel Atlantis for four days and overall the hotel is OK. Is far away from the Pudong Airport but its relatively close to Puxi and the Pudong city centre. The hotel is actually close to quite a few food places and you need to be adventurous and walk around the city and check out the places to eat. The hotel staff are ok. Some spoke good english but some staff in concierge lacked a bit in their English. If you need to go to Puxi I would suggest catching a cab as its relatively cheap. Taxi from airport to the hotel i about 125Yuan. 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Good choice for Business travellers My company liked to put me and my colleagues here in this hotel because it's reasonably priced and it's close to our office. Their suite is fairly big with a living room and separate bedroom.The only knock on this hotel is definitely location. It's not within walking distance from the public transportation routes including subway. I recalled one occasion where we went out for dinner one night, it started to snow heavily and we couldn't find a taxi to take us back to the hotel. At the end, we called the hotel and the conciege staff was kind enough to send a taxi over to bring us back. Of course we were already frozen to death having waited on the cold street for almost an hour. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Not bad Not the cheapest stay, but it doesn't look cheap. Most of the staff were nice but not easy to communicate with. You have to speak simply and slowly. We didn't have a problem with the non-smoking room smelling of cigatette smoke, but 2 other guests told us they did. As well as some guests smoking in non-smoking areas, we saw several who didn't seem to have any respect for the hotel or other guests, even like spitting and discarding half-eaten candy on the floor. I wonder how the hotel will look in a few years if guests are allowed to not follow rules like that? "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"If only distant wasnt the factor Upon reading the previous reviews, i was quite worried. Most of the negative reviews are that it is quite far from the actions. I am visiting shanghai for 9 nights and stayed in Novotel Atlantis for 3 of it. I didnt really care whether the hotel will be far or not because I have another 6 nights in Westin right in the centre of town.Let me tell you this. It is not as far as i would have imagined from reading the reviews.I got a perfect room on the 37th floor, a corner room. Absolutely perfect view of the Shanghai Pudong Skyline (from the back) on one side and the commercial ports on the other.The checkin was rather annoying, considering i have already given them a call that i will be arriving at about 1am. That didnt bother me much though.The room was beautiful, spacious (maybe its the corner room) and as i said, with a beautiful view.Room service food was of good quality. House keeping really leaves you alone with the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign on, which is what look for in any hotel.On my second day, I went up to the Art50 Restaurant on the top floor, which is a revolving restaurant. The food was ok, a seafood buffet, i am not a big fan of seafood, and i dont know why i go for it.But i think to seafood lovers it might be great, I'll leave that for you people to comment.At the dinner, the Director of Food and Bev noticed that i was having dinner alone (I was travelling alone), he came by to greet me. Talked to him for a while and i must say he is a very understanding and professional in hospitality issues.Oh, and he ordered a good pint of beer for me, on the house, which is always welcoming to any Aussie.Upon my departure day, i went down for breakfast at 2nd Deck Cafe. The Breakfast were nice, they cook egg on the spot for you. I reckon the bread could be better, it can get rock hard.Staff at the breakfast service were rather less friendly, and rarely smile, but that didnt really bother me. One good thing, they were very quick to remove your used plates, which is a real plus.Check out were quick and pleasant. The bellboy was quick to get to the room, and the Reception staff were very quick in processing. Further more, He did make sure that i quoted the correct A-Club Membership number.Overall, it was a pleasant stay. If you werent looking for a hotel right in the heart of town, then Novotel could be the hotel of choice. I would have to agree with most previous reviews about the hotel being abit out of the way, but fortunately for me, as i said, it wasn't part of the factor to consider for this stay. I would love to come back to this hotel again. Recommended for service. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"What A Disaster The other reviews point out this hotels unfavourable location. It is removed from shops, restaurants and anything that would give a visitor thr feeling of being in Shanghai. The rooms a clean and well maintained but the staff have limited English for foreign visitors. It is a hotel without a sense of place. I did not try their premier restaurant on the top floor but hosted business guests to the rather expensive 118 yuan buffet on the second floor and was left embarrased by the poor quality of the food and the confussed selection. Another review warned about the in-room massage in which &quot;extras&quot; are offered - be warned - not a good look for Accor the operator. Another warning; I booked on the Accor website and when there was a problem the Assist Front Office Mgr produced a print-out with my full credit card number, my name and the security three digit code from the back of the card - a security nightmare. There are plenty of better alternatives that will give visitor a sense of the excitement that is Shanghai. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Good mid-range hotel This is a nice hotel with friendly staff. The room was fine with cable tv, fridge and the bottled water came in handy (although it was cheap to buy in the city as well). The hotel is a bit out of the tourist area, with the walk to the river taking about 40 minutes. However, pudong dadao runs outside the hotel and is a major rd so you can easily get a bus, or a taxi from the hotel, which are very cheap. A taxi to nanjing donglu (major shopping area over the river) costs about 25RMB which is very cheap in western money. Even the taxi from the airport was only the equivalent of $20 for a 1 hour ride. However, the taxi drivers go fast and drive to their own rules so buckle up! Also, there is a metro station 1 block away and the trains are great in Shanghai (although crowded). The breakfast is standard western/asian hot buffett and Olive's restaurant was good (and cheap). Make sure you learn some basic Chinese before you come or ask the staff to write down the hotel name in Chinese to give to taxi drivers. I found very few people (and hardly any taxi drivers) spoke English. The people in Shanghai are however very friendly and accommodation and you can get along fine with a smile and laugh. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,Hotel assessment I stayed for a week at the Novotel Atlantis in Pudong. The location is more suited to business people than tourists. However the rate was much cheaper (around $50/night cheaper) than for hotels in the city centre (eg the Bund). A taxi to the Bund costs about 20 yuan ($3). So for a 10 minute trip it was a reasonable trade off. A subway station is one block away for even cheaper transport. The hotel room was as expected for 4 star. Restaurants in the hotel were disappointing but typical for Shanghai. (The Hyatt's highly rated restaurant cost me $300 for 2 and was much inferior to Hong Kong standards.) The standard of food hygiene at Novotel appeared good however. The breakfast buffet was quite good. The hotel gives you a litre of bottled water every day which is essential in Shanghai. Travel advice from the concierge or other staff was really unavailable due to their extemely limited English ability. Not even brochures were available. Most other guests were Europeans so English may not be in demand much. Conclusion: would stay there again but with lower expectations. 
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"I suspect you can find better in Shanghai The rooms are nice enough but the hotel is not the best run Novotel in Asia. You might want to avoid the hotel restaurants as they are pretty hopeless. The independent Chinese restaurant just outside the main entrance to the left is vastly superior and is an impressive destination. After some 10 days of meetings and travellng I thought a nice massage, steam and sauna might be in order. Unfortunately the massage girl got a bit upset when I declined the 'Special Massage'. Very disappointing to end up in this scenario in a major brand hotel. If this is not your thing then best avoided.The Sofitel Pudong was classier and not very much more expensive, I will stay there in future. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Nice hotel in shanghai We stayed at this hotel on (23 &amp; 24 August) and booked the hotel through the hotel website. The down side to this hotel is that it is quite far away from downtown Shanghai and that there is not much to see or do near the hotel, there is a subway about 15 minutes walk away or you need to use taxis.On the positive side the hotel is very clean, with very friendly and knowledgeable staff who speak good english. The rooms are modern and of a very high standard, the rooms higher up have great views of the river. the hotel has a pool and plenty of restaurants and bars. special mention for the very helpful concierge staff.overall very good hotel and good value for money, pity about the distance from downtown. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"A good Hotel in Pudong I stayed in this Hotel several times during last year and my general opinion is very positive....nice modern rooms with great view if they are on high floors, good restaurants, and very nice bar on the 50th floor (turning around slowly and giving excellent view to Shanghai by night...No serious problems except that is in Pudong area and not so close to the centre of Shanghai (need taxi) "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Nice comfortable hotel but inconvenient uninteresting location. I stay at this hotel whenever my company sends me to Shanghai for business. It is certainly a good hotel for business especially if you’re doing business in the Pudong area. However, I would not recommend this for tourists simply because it is far or at least inconvenient to get to the central and more interesting neighborhoods of the city, like the Bund or Nanjing Road. You’ll have to take a taxi or subway to get anywhere. Sometimes, it’s hard to get a taxi during rush hour or when it’s raining! Besides, there’s really nothing interesting within walking distance around the hotel’s neighborhood, certainly not restaurants, cafes, or shopping. The hotel has a fairly large lounge/bar and a business lounge on the 48th floor. Rooms are spacious, especially the “de luxe” rooms. They are well-lit, have light colored modern furnishings, very clean, and have ample closet space. Most, if not all rooms have birds-eye views of the city, beautiful especially at night! Beds are firm, almost too firm, pillows are thin, and towels not very plush but they do supply a bathrobe, slippers, and complimentary bottled water. Nice touch with the fresh rose on the pillow at turndown and rose petals floating in the toilet! The hotel’s gym is not very big but well-equipped. The restaurants are adequate but I would not recommend eating there if you don’t have to, not good value for the money and the quality of food is inconsistent at best. But the breakfast buffet is not bad, a good variety of dishes. Overall, the hotel is good value for the money if you don’t mind the location being inconveniently away from the city center and attractions. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Great Hotel My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Novotel Atlantis the first week of Feb 2007. I did not book the hotel, my friend did, and I was very concerned after reading reviews on this site.We all had excellent experiences. Upon arrival we were upgraded to business class at no extra charge to us. Our rooms were small but well appointed and had everything you could need. The beds were hard, but we ordered an extra duvet and put it under us. The bedding and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms were spotless, and we recieved turn down service every night. We were brought 2 fresh roses every night, and when they do the turn down service, they also tidy the bathroom and put rose petals in the toilet. The rooms have robes, irons, and all the comforts of home plus a few more. The toiletries were exceptional, with nothing left out.The restaurants were great. They were a little expensive, but the quality and selection were great. There was a small deli type restaurant, as well as two casual dining rooms, and the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor. There was also a lounge just off the lobby.Our every wish was catered to promptly and professionaly. I was dreading check out becuase I had read negative things here on this site. I went over the entire bill (6 nights and all meals) with a fine tooth comb and there were absolutely no mistakes. The couple we were travelling with had no problems either.The rooms had complimentary bottled water daily.The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well. The concierge and front end staff were especially helpful in directing taxi drivers for us, and providing us with notes in chinese to give to taxi drivers.It was about 15 min from major shopping, but we didn't mind because we got to see more of the city.I would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again myself. Everything exceeded my expectations, and believe me, I can be a fussy hotel guest.I almost forgot to mention the fabulous workout facility. It was a fully stocked gym. The change rooms have steam rooms and hot tubs. This was all complimentary. The pool was beautiful with lots of windows to oversee the city.I did find the spa services a little expensive, and did not ingulge. However, I am sure they were par with market value.Do not hesitate to stay here. It is definatley a business/corporate hotel. They know how to treat their guests with all the comforts of home, including western food. Have a great trip! "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Terrible service remote location never again We read good reviews of the hotel, and we booked 4 nights in January 2007 through their hotel website. The hotel is far from all attractions of the city. There is absolutely nothing interesting around the hotel (other than a frienly local massage service opposite the entrance). Your best bet is to take a taxi to metro station and then a metro to city centre. You can of course take a taxi to the city, but the traffic is so bad that it would take you close to one hour, and the bets that you will be cheated by taxi driver is more than 50%. The hotel is a highrise building, so nice views especially at night, but rooms are simple, and in our room the heating was not working. However it took us one day and three different engineers to convince them that the heating was not working properly. After that, they changed our room, and the heating was fine, but by then we already got ill. Any service in the hotel is very very pricey and very bad. For example internet access was 4 yuans per minute (240 yuans or 24 euros per hour), and the connection was slow (apparently due to an earthquake in Taiwan). the same connection is 3 yuans PER HOUR in the city, and in 1 yuan per minute (60 yuans per hour) in a 5 star hotel in Shanghai. Also, the hotel double charged the bill when I booked through internet (apparently they had a problem with their VISA machine that day). Explaining the situation was a communication nightmare, as there are noone who speaks good English. Worse is that they think they understand! After hours of battling they agreed to contact the finance department who acknowedged the error, but I am still waiting for the refund. In short, I would never stay in this hotel again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Great value for your money we have been 2 nights in october in this hotel and got a corner-room in the 41 th floor. we had a view to the jin mao tower and the bund. the room was very clean and comfortable. we booked over the accor-hotels.com webside and payed approx. 95 US-$ for one night.the staff is very helpful and friendly. the breakfast buffet is excellent, you can find something for europeans/americans or for asians.when you come from pudong airport take the magnetic train and then take a taxi to the hotel, it cost you approx. 3 US-$. when you go to the bund take also a taxi, its about 15 minutes and cost you approx. 2 US-S. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Had a great stay at the Novotel This was a typical novotel property. Clean and business like throughout. The rooms were simply and nicely appointed. Some great views from the upper floors including some spectacular views of the Jin Mao Tower - Shaghai's tallest building. The hotel is located in the Pudong district and is about a 20 min taxi ride from the main toruist areas of the The Bund. The good news is that the taxis in shangahi are very relaible and really cheap and you can get them from the front of the hotel. There really isn't much around the area as far as shops or restaurants. Ask the hotel and they will direct you to a couple of large shopping and restaurant complexes about 5 min taxi from the hotel. You might want to try dining at the revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel. I never did so can't comment, but the ride to the top is fun in a stomach churning glass elevator some 70 stories! The hotel had great indoor pool and spa facilities which we used quite a bit as well. Overall a good choice - though not in the heart of the tourist area. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"Not the best but hey its just a Novotel This hotel is adequate for business travel.The lobby was just ok, a typical 3.5 - 4 star.The location was great for Pudong access, but terrible if your on holidays, 45mins from the French Con.The service was just average. Concierge was bad.If you dont speak Mandarin commuication will be a chore, but not impossible, I speak Mandarin, but tested out the staffs English skill, not to great.The room itself was typical of all novotels.I paid for a sedan transfer to the airport and ended up with a mini bus that was in need of retirement.Look this place didn't blow me away. If you don't have another option by all means stay here. But personally I think its highly overpriced for what it is. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"enjoy my stay Altho' not near to the shopping area and public transport, it is quiet and clean. Stay in deluxe room and asked for the city view. Taxi is still cheap and can get you anywhere. "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,"I'll stay here again. Very good value for money. Clean, efficient and quite satisfactory in Pudong - everything one really needs. Seems to be popular with French tourists and unpretentious business travellers (that's me). I'm becoming a Novotel fan... . "
novotel atlantis shanghai ,great hotel in the pudong I had a 4 day stay here recently. Rooms were lovely although windows a bit small. The conference facilities were great too. The position of the hotel is in the pudong which means for the markets and the bund you need to catch a taxi but it is very cheap at 2 euros for most rides! Stay and enjoy!

okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Excellent Location and Service First time to stay in this hotel. Location is excellent. 2 minutes walk to subway station and they have a excellent manned cab station (the person in charge of the cab stationis from the cab company)Room is smaller than expected but adequate. Excellent service in almost all areas including the coffee shop, the lounge bar, the Japanese restaurant, housekeeping, etc.Will come back if the price is right "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,Better than before This was my 2nd time to stay at Okura Garden.Room was renovated and became much better than before.Best in this hotel is not smelly water. I will stay here again when I save some money rather than stay at 5 star hotels. 
okura garden hotel shanghai ,Value for money i have been many times to this hotel excellent service but little bit costly laundry is really very costly other wise everything is ok 
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Lovely hotel but poor value with uncomfortable beds and best avoided for Westerners The historic luxury hotel in the old French club has one of the most beautiful hotel lounges you will ever see as well as a lovely garden and for a European the Japanese orientation adds a further exotic spice to your stay. Previous comments about the old decor really miss the point as it is exceptionally beautiful (be sure to look at the function rooms upstairs which are fine examples of art deco). Service too is excellent in the Japanese tradition. BUT it has some Japanese-style disadvantages too - very few staff speak significant English, the beds are as hard as the floors and it is very expensive. We stayed in a club room with access to the club lounge - a total waste of money as the room is not very comfortable, the staff were uninterested and there was little on offer, not even enough food for breakfast (and staff had too little English to understand when I complained). I would not recommend this hotel for Western travellers. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Nice hotel but a bit dated I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. I didn't know the history of this hotel until I came back home. At first glance, the hotel seemed like any other older hotels. However, as I walked around the first floor and saw the nice staircase, I knew this place must have been of some historical significance.The room itself was ok size, but I felt that the furniture, TV, and the bathroom were a bit dated. Since this is a Japanese chain, the appliances (TV, hairdryer) are from Japan. I did enjoy the heated Japanese bidet, a welcoming surprise when you go to the bathroom in middle of the night. I also enjoyed the bath salts provided in the bathroom.I thought the location is pretty convenient, close to the shopping district on Huaihai Road. It's also not too far from the Yu Garden, Nanjing Road, and Xintiandi -- just a quick tax ride. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,Good Location Good hotel good location all the staff were exellent we booked a Deluxe King Garden View room. Located close to shops and restaurants and the garden is a nice place to walk if you dont want to venture out late. 
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Below average for 5 star In the competitive Shanghai hotel marketplace, the 5 star Okura Garden ranks far below many other hotels of similiar class. The hotel suffers from being older and not as fresh as other properties in the city. The room was clean, contained all the amenities that you would expect in a 5 star hotel, and had a helpful staff. But, the room looked and felt dated as did the lobby and other common areas. Location was good and provided easy access to the city, airport and train station. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel but in Shanghai, there are much better choices for the money. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel We were at the Okura Garden during a week long business event. The hotel staff was very accomodating and helpful. The rooms were nice, clean, and well supplied. The Rose Garden restaraunt was adequate for breakfast. We enjoyed the local suggestions made by the concierge staff and they were very helpful in calling cabs and making arrangements for attractions.One of the benefits of this hotel is its proximity to many other ammentities. The subway is one block away as is a grocery store and a major shopping street.The location is one of the true strengths of this hotel! "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Quaint hotel refurbished from an old part of Shanghai I like this quaint hotel for its preservation of the old French Club building, which has become most of the lobby and some of the shops and coffee house. The restoration was sensitively done, which shows through the details of the neo-classical style architecture and the decor choices e.g. the chandeliers, the tiles and marble used etc etc. You will feel a good piece of 1930s Shanghai in la belle epoque, something which excites me each time I go through the lobby.The rooms are a drab too old in my opinion. They look like trapped in 1980s style, with the carpets worn (but clean) and the TV set from my high school days! The bathroom was small, with no separate showers and the tap was reeking with rust and age. I thought the room which my colleague stayed in at the 22nd floor looked much better. I think the renovations have yet to be carried out to the lower-floor rooms, one of which I was staying in.Otherwise, the room's amenities were adequate. The toilet seat was an interesting electronic one, Japanese style, which sent out a jet of water each time I press a button. To wash the soil out of your you-know-what! Trust the Japanese to think of this!That the hotel was Japanese run was obvious from the moment you stepped in. The counter staff display a badge stating how proficient they are in the Japanese language, and the number of Japanese guests could have been in the hundreds. THere are also displays in Japanese throughout.SO being so Japanese means service levels should be higher than what you'd usually get in Shanghai. And for this, the hotel did not disappoint.Let me quote you an example: I asked for a big bed as that's my preference. They originally run out of such beds when I first booked, but I think they noted my preference and when I checked in, they allowed that for me. Nice touch and means so much to me.All in all, this hotel is a dated outfit with some parts crying out for an overhaul. But its software makes up for a lot of the wants in the hardware, and I think I will likely wish to return, especially to one of their renovated rooms. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Quiet clean a bit dated Japanese hotel in China The Okura´s entrance is an architectural landmark in a very nice garden in a good area of Shanghai. The lobby is very well appointed and it is a pleasant place to be. Room was very clean all around, comfortable if a touch small and a bit dated. My TV was a very old Hitachi, I mean really old, almost a collectible. Cable reception was of poor quality perhaps for that reason. If you like quiet and don´t mind staying in a 1980s feel Japanese hotel, this might be your choice. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Central and comfortable Not a bad spot and recommended to me by a well travelled Japanese friend. In my case, the stay involved an overnighter after a 3 week business trip in China and so I appreciated the calm and cleanliness of the rooms, the view of the gardens - especially watching the people exercise in the morning, tea in the lobby lounge, an excellent sushi dinner and very good morning breakfast. I also enjoyed the elegant style of the place despite its occasional 1970's appearance tower block. Service was friendly and the porters were excellent.There are probably better places to stay in Shanghai but this hotel was central and comfortable. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Deep in the French Concession The Okura Garden Hotel is top notch. The lobby area and public rooms are in the old French Club, which was the social center for the French expatriates living in the old French Concession. They have been beautifully restored, especially the lobby lounge. There is a lovely garden, actually a small private park, in front of the hotel. The hotel rooms are in a 33-story tower that has been added at the back (ala the Helmsley Palace Hotel in NYC). Our room(#2222) had a king-size bed and lots of storage space, but the sitting area was pretty tight. The bathroom was outstanding with plenty of counter space, a large square sink, a toilet with a heated 'bidet' seat, and a separate glassed-in room with a shower area in front of a tub with a window looking into the bedroom (for watching TV during your bubble bath? for putting on a show for your significant other?). Fortunately, for the more modest there was a venetian blind on that window.The lights for reading in bed were completely inadequate. The table lamps next to the bed are too dim, so you need the ceiling light in the center of the room to read a book or newspaper.High-speed internet is 120rmb per 24-hours. We had a problem with a loose connection and the hotel's tech guy was there to fix it immediately. The bell staff and room staff were all cheerful and spoke adequate English.The staff at the concierge desk communicated effectively in English and understood and responded to our needs. The front desk staff was a little less able to communicate. Room service dinners were excellent and the service was impeccable. The breakfast buffet was ample with plenty of choices of American-style food. Unfortunately there was always a line for tables.The hotel's location is a little bit remote from The Bund and People's Square area, but it is just two blocks from a very nice shopping street and taxis are cheap and plentiful all over the city.The Okura Garden is clearly a 5-star operation, well-managed, comfortable and sumptuous. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Okura Garden Hotel The Okura is in a 1920's ish building, which is located in the French Concession area of Shanghai. The lobby area is well maintained and has a nice historic feel to it. The hotel seems to target Japanese business travelers and the tour bus set. The rooms were only so so. For the price, I expected much more. But then again the last time I was in Shanghai, I stayed at the Le Meridien so anything would probably pale in comparison to that, at least room wise. The decor was dated although everything was clean and functional. The bathroom did feature a typical Japanese toilet, with a variety of functions. Seat warmer, multiple spray options, etc. Whenever I turned the light on for the bathroom, the toilet made a &quot;start up sound&quot; so that took a bit of getting used to. The internet cost was 120 rmb. Sadly it didn't always work and was painfully slow when it did.The breakfast buffet was good and offered a large selection of items. The breakfast room was very busy.The hotel staff was very good. All of the employees wore a nametag that indicated the languages that they spoke.The hotel is located on a side street just off of Huai Hai Zhong Lu, which is one of the main shopping streets for Shanghai. A metra station is on the same block as the hotel. A Parkson's department store is also on the same block. The Parkson's has a nice grocery store in the basement and the ever popular McDonald's and Hagen Daz (sp?) at the front entrance of the store. A Starbucks can be found across the street from Parksons .If you have time, take a walk around the neighborhood as you will see a nice mix of old and new China. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Love the renovated rooms especially the shower area I have stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and did again recently when my usual choice in Shanghai is unavailable. I was booked into one of the renovated rooms and was pleasantly surprised. The renovated has a new furnishing and bathroom. The bathroom is excellent. Plenty of bright lights and very large shower area. The water pressure of the shower is real stress reliever after a long day. Being a Japanese hotel, a lot of attention has been paid to the bathroom, not forgetting the the toilet seat with warmer! The bed was on the hard side and the small pillow are not my favourite. While the rooms are very modern looking, I cannot help but noted the hotel lobby is in need of an update. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Very pleased! Stayed for five days in March and was very pleased. The hotel was undergoing renovation on three floors but did not impact us in any way. Our room was a bit dated but well appointed and comfortable. The bath was great and one of the best showers I have had in a hotel. Concierge staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet should no be missed as there was delicious food for many different appetites. It was a great way to start the day. The location is great for touring and restaurants. The garden is beautiful and a serene spot in the busy city. I would definately recommend this hotel, however, I suspect the price will be higher when renovations are complete. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Nice hotel The Okura Garden Hotel in Shanghai was a very pleasant stay. Located in the French Concession area of Shanghai, it was only a quarter mile from Metro Line 1 and a major shopping area. The rooms were very nice, clean and well-appointed. The lobby, bars, and fitness facilities (3 treadmills, 2 bicycles, stairstepper, rower, freeweights, and benches) were excellent. For over $250/night U.S., it should be good! Majority of the guests were Japanese. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel but not the Deluxe service advertised The write-ups and reviews of the Okura Garden led me to believe I was in or something truly special. The reality fell short of this. As a westerner perhaps I am not this hotel’s main targeted demographic, (this is a Japanese chain aimed very much for that market), but my expectations were not met. First, let’s review what the hotel did well:- The staff are all polite and friendly and many are multi-lingual, - the views from the rooms are impressive, - the food in the three in-house restaurants is good and the rooms are kept clean. - the hotel is also conveniently close to a station on the excellent underground Metro system, which I used several times and found by far the cheapest and safest way to get around the city. (Taxis are plentiful but they drive like utter lunatics, and with seatbelts almost unknown here you risk much!)- There is the grass garden area out front – which is pretty unique in the city. The area is not vast and the proximity of traffic and the associated smog (in sunny weather especially) means this is not quite the oasis they describe, but it is still a nice feature. Now for the bad news:All the talk of 5-stars, best hotel in town, etc. both on this site and others made me expect the very best hotel experience, which this was not. For this money I expected an iron in the room, not a pressing service you have to pay extra for. The air conditioning was rather old and worn out, it taking most of the day to modify the room to be comfortable, as well as taking a day or so to clear the musty smell from the system. The promised internet access proved too mysterious for my laptop to handle, which was annoying for a business trip. My minibar contents had not been replaced in so long that not only were they all well past their use-by dates, but one glass bottle shattered in my hand when I just tried to lift it – a casualty of being in the very cold fridge for months if not years!The bed’s mattress was very firm and on one morning I found that my bedsheets had been replaced with a set that was very over-starched and that made my skin crawl. Not a good move.I also wish the staff would learn the difference between being attentive and being pestering. I didn’t need a maid to come in for a second time in the evening to “turn down” the bed and rearrange all my things gratuitously. Maybe this is a service others value and expect but it’s the first time I’ve encountered it and I found it intrusive and rather patronising. I don’t want to give the impression this is a bad hotel, because it is certainly a good one with service levels above many I have stayed in before. It just, in my view, does not justify the deluxe price tag -- especially when it has the competition in Shanghai from a wealth of other chains: Hilton, Four Seasons, Hyatt, etc., some of which I visited and was *very* impressed by. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Quiet comfortable great service I enjoyed my stay at the Okura Garden very much. The garden is large and welcoming -- an oasis of peace and tranquility in a noisy city. The food was excellent and quite diverse, though pricey in the upstairs European and Japanese restaurants. Not especially fashionable but the service and wonderful location more than make up for the slightly worn quality. Rooms not large but well equipped, clearly aimed at Japanese customers. Bathrooms lovely, with old marble and huge bathtubs. Easy walk to best open air market in Shanghai as well as many other sights - wonderful spot in middle of French concession. "
okura garden hotel shanghai ,"Close to marketplace and good value This is hotel was presumably was built to welcome Japanese guests during Asia's go-go 80's. While it remains well cared for by the daily staff, the only way to reverse the aging of a hotel is to renovate. In the case of the Okura Garden, one can't help but notice the dated decor and tired carpets. Its older ambiance stands in contrast to the many newer addresses in the world's most dynamic city. All that said, the staff are superb, the facilities (including restaurants) entirely correct for the price. Rooms are clean. If you want Shanghai chic, stay at the Westin. If you want a good deal and good service, stay here.A major bonus with this hotel is its location near Shanghai's best outdoor marketplace. Louis Vuitton's worst nightmare, no doubt, but a really fun place to stock up on snobby brand knock-offs and nice silk items for friends back home. "

oriental riverside hotel ,"Oriental Riverside Hotel in Shanghai Well.... it is 5 star so pretty damn good!!! However, it is in a disappointing area - unless you like cement and glitzy high rises. On our last day the entire ball room (that was fun - 24 hours and a big band played each night) and lobby were under scaffolding - so renovations are on right now, I guess. I must say that the highlight is the POOL!!!! Inside a glass dome overlooking the river - spectacular. By Chinese standards, it is $$$, but it is 5 star......... "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Could do with a rennovation but good value nonetheless. Stayed while attending a conference in the adjoining convention centre. The hotel was in an excellent location, being in very close proximity to public transport, shops, restaurants etc. Staff were all very polite and helpful, although not all spoke fluent English. I can accept this. After all it isn't an English speaking country!The service was very good and the food was also of a very high standard.Our only major disappointment was that the room looked like it could do with a makeover. i.e. new carpet, a new coat of paint. Similar could be said for the corridors outside the room. Nonetheless it was a very clean room and we couldn't fault it otherwise.The gym also needs a serious upgrade with all the exercise equipment out of order!The pool was a highlight, being on the top of the hotel, with surrounding views of Shanghai.We were also given a discount, before arrival for no apparent reason. Certainly no complaints about that, and only added to the positive experience. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Great room great facilities good location and nice view We had an early check-in and we had to pay. But that was no problem, the room was really good and luxurious. We had a great view on the Oriental pearl, Jin Mao tower and SWFC tower. The Bund Sightseeing Tunnel is just a few steps away from the hotel and the fastest way to get to the Bund. The subway is ofcourse cheaper. But that takes a 5-7 minute walk. Make sure you visit the Super Brand Mall!Because of the jetlag we missed breakfast and we had dinner in the city. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Dysfunctional hotel with lots of service issues Bad experience on the first day itself. Staff couldn't find my reservation and had to hassle with them for close to an hour just so I can get a room which then was only available for 2 of 3 nights I needed it. If not for my father-in-law knowing a higher-up, I'd have had to move out a day early. Adding insult to injury, room I got was a smoking room.Then on day 3, came back to room one afternoon and key wouldn't work. Came down and got new key. Went up and it didn't work either. Went down again to get new key and had to tell a staff to follow me up and try it for themselves and he did and it didn't work either. Went down again (3rd time now), asst mgr came down, wanted me to come up, I said forget it - they go up and fix and I'll go up only when they did it. Waited 10 min, was told to go up and problem was fixed.Went up and while I was there, a group of 4 staff were waiting and they swiped the card and... it didn't work. After getting multiple keys swiped, finally found one that worked and they gave to me with assurances it would work going forward. I told them maybe they should switch me to a new room and they said not to worry. Well, we'll see as I'm writing this review right after this happened...Bottom-line, a) staff can't accommodate you if you've got problems (doesn't matter who's at fault) and b) there will be problems. Food is only average. For a hotel room costing equivalent of USD 150 per night (which for Shanghai is a major amount), I could've gotten a 5-star experience somewhere else.To be fair, the positives are it's good location near the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and across river from the Bund area.Take my advice - pay the same money and stay somewhere else. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Nice hotel terrible service. The Oriental Riverside hotel is, unusually, a pretty low rise hotel in the Pudong area of Shanghai. It's near enough to most things (Oriental Pearl TV Tower is two minutes away, Shanghai WFC centre about 10, lots of restaurants on the water front and plenty of shopping), and both the underground (5 minute walk) and tourist tunnel (right outside the door) are near enough to make getting across the river quite easy. The hotel itself is right on the banks of the river and, if you've got a room on the right side, the views over the wide Pudong river are interesting, if not necessarily spectacular. Our room, a riverside view room, was spacious, well equipped and comfortable. The lobby area was large, dramatic and inviting. Overall, impressions of the hotel were good.Sadly, it was all let down by terrible service.Check in was fine, with the normal credit card impressions and so on. Shown to our room, the staff member opened the door and walked in and then loitered as if waiting for a tip. Having spent three weeks so far in China, and found tipping to be uncommon (and I even encountered refusals) this led to an awkward few moments. Shortly afterwards, a woman burst in to the room carrying a small vase, insisting we needed on in the bathroom. Shortly after that, another woman came in and removed the fruit bowl, declaring that it's not ours and we're not allowed it.The concierge desk was useless. Asking about what times the viewing platform of the World Financial Centre was open (it's 1,555 feet up and is, currently, the highest viewing platform in the world - definitely worth visiting), we were told it that this newly opened attraction was closed, despite the fact I could see camera flashes coming from the platform. Ignoring them, we went anyway, paid our money, and enjoyed an hour or so at the top of the world.Asking the concierge to book a taxi for 5am proved impossible, with us being told that there's no point as they wouldn't turn up. A phone call to a taxi firm myself soon had one booked, and they turned up bang on time.Asking about times for the MagLev train to the airport (we had to go very early) we were given two different opening times, both of which were wrong.These are basics, especially for a business hotel that's attached to the International Convention Center, and it's unforgiveable that they got such basic things so wrong. A 5-star hotel's concierge service is relied upon by visitors, and by failing in that area they've let the entire hotel down.As did the staff at checkout. Never before, at any standard of hotel, have I been made to wait at reception while a staff member goes to check I've not stolen anything from the room.It's a lovely hotel, but I couldn't leave it quick enough. We were tempted to stay at either of the Hyatt hotels at the WFC or Jin Mao tower, but decided to save some money and stay on the river. When we go back, it'll be to the Hyatt.As an aside, when you're in Shanghai make sure you leave time for a few drinks and a bite to eat at the Cloud 9 bar in the Jin Mao tower. It's difficult to find, requiring three different lifts, some stairs and a few corridors and, once you get there, it's very expensive, but it's worth the effort and every penny you'll spend there. Really. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Great locationgood Hotel I was with my wife for 3 nights. We enjoyed very much our stay in oriental riverside. Very nice room ,good breakfast, best location in Pudong,with nice view to the Bund. 5 star Hotel with friendy staff. Will stay again in this Hotel,recomended!! "
oriental riverside hotel ,"OK room Terrible Service Felt cheated Bad location Old gym equip My husband and I are frequent travelers. We live in hotels more often than we live in our own condo in Chicago. In a nutshell, stay at a 5-star hotel on the Bund side of equivalent cost. There isn't much to do on the Pudong side. We found ourselves taking the metro to the Bund everyday and coming back to the Pudong side only to sleep at our hotel. Stay anywhere on Nanjing Road and I think you'll be quite happy about how close you are to everything you want to see while in Shanghai as a tourist. Here's a detailed list of the bad experience we had at this hotel:- Upon check-in we asked for a non-smoking room. We got to our room that had a &quot;no-smoking&quot; sign outside the door. Once entering, it reeked of smoke and incents (probably trying to cover up the cigarette smoke smell). We asked for another room at the front desk, they told us they didn't believe us because it is supposed to be a non-smoking room. They sent a bellman with us to confirm before giving us another room. This is move #1. In our 2nd room (445), it was smoke-free. Then later, the entire floor smelled of smoke, so much so that it started entering our room. We then placed pillows at the foot of our door to prevent the smoke from entering our room (see photo). They need to implement a non smoking floor entirely.- Outwardly, the hotel LOOKS like a 5-star hotel, but the staff are not trained professionally including their assistant manager. Our internet did not work in our room, so they said we can use their Business Center for FREE for the rest of the day. Later that day, they tried to charge us for the Business Center services. At first they denied knowing about our internet problems, then they acknowledged that they heard about it and would charge us the reduced rate. Um... hello?! It was offered to us for FREE since we had paid for the internet service in our room that we weren't getting. It was so obvious they were trying to cheat us out of our money. This conversation was with the assistant manager, Mark Cai. Eventually, we moved into another room where the internet works. This was move #2.- Gym equipment: Treadmills are so old, the tracks are frayed at the edges so that if you don't pay attention, you could trip and fall off the treadmill and seriously hurt yourself. The stationary bike (both of them) don't work. The free weights all have rust at the handles. - Currency exchange: On our last night at Shanghai, we wanted to take a river cruise but needed more cash to pay for the tickets. We tried several times to retrieve cash from the hotel lobby ATM which had worked on previous days but failed on this particular night. We asked the front desk if they could just charge us the amount onto our room and give us the cash? Their response: NO. Could you exchange our Yen? NO. Could you exchange our Taiwan dollars? NO. Then they (Alex, Anthony) proceeded to joke around in Mandarin making statements such as while laughing: &quot;These people have no more money. They are poor.&quot; My husband understand Mandarin and told me this later. Completely unprofessional behavior. Since they were unwilling to help us, we missed our cruise. On our last night, instead of spending a romantic night on our cruise, I found myself writing a very long list of complaints and suggestions for the General Manager; a letter which I highly doubt will get to the General Manager given the poor service we have received the entirely of our 6 days stay at this hotel.- If you DO decide to stay here. Don't stay in room 425. The 5th floor is a banquet hall so at nights you'll here hours of chairs, tables and other furniture being dragged across the floor. Also, there are 2 different parts of the hotel. When entering the lobby. Request for rooms facing the river, it's nicer. They will initially try to fill the ghetto half of their hotels first (our first room).- There are no flat screen tv's here. For a 5-star hotel, that's pretty backwards.- Check out also took nearly 30 minutes.- When my husband and I came downstairs with all our luggage, not 1 of the 3 bellman there came over to help us. One Cuasian couple came down with their luggage, all 3 ran over... yes RAN over to them to help them with their luggage. Travel tip in Asia: Even if you can speak the language. Use English to get more respect and better service. It's sad but true.- The only great thing about our room was the view. We had the view of the Bund and the Huangpu River from our window. At night you can see all the brightly lit river boat cruises go by like a parade. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"OK Hotel with good location but felt cheated We just came back from our stay at this hotel and wanted to share some feedback for others to be aware of.The GoodStandard room with the best aspect being the location, right next to Pearl Tower. Also recommended is the Super Brand Mall (SBM) opposite the Pearl Tower. Plenty of great eating choices there on the 5/6th floors. As we hadn't bought breakfast at the hotel, we often ate there - with good satisfaction. Particularly recommended: try the Green Tea Icecream Shake at the Noodle Bar on 5F of SBM, or any of their other outlets in town...The Bad- Our room had a small working room attached to it. This was barely cleaned (with thick layer/smell of dust) and a previous guest's nail clippings!- Spa Area was a bit murky, no lights in sauna, steamroom out of operation, murky waters in the jacuzzi, and the spa attendant using the relaxation room mainly to - relax himself!- We had reserved the room via HRS.COM understanding that internet was included. We were then told this was not the case. At check out, we were then charged further for internet based on time of log-in and not actualy online usage. So if you log on ur first day for even 5 minutes, the times starts running from then, and you can end up paying an exorbitant rate of RMB 120 for 2x 24 hour time periods within the same day!! Especially dodgy because they charged us internet for a day, when their internet server was down for 8 hours! At check out, there was no understanding for the client's situation by the front desk staff Alex Shen and Amy Tang, who just said said that that's how the computer calculated it, so that's how they would charge it - very bad behaviour.You can have better hotels with better locations and far better customer service in Shanghai. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Standard business hotel We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights for a conference at the Shanghai International Convention Center. I booked this hotel through another website and definitely got a great deal. I don't think that the hotel is worth its published room rates or the conference advertised rates.Because this hotel is attached to the Convention Center, it is very convenient. You never have to walk outside, which is great if it's cold or rainy.The front desk staff is helpful and speak decent English. One of the best things about the hotel was luggage storage. I was traveling around China for a week before the meeting and they stored my luggage until I returned. Nothing was lost, and that was great. The hotel also offers currency exchange. What is interesting is that if you booked your room through another website, when you check out, they do not give you your receipt. You have to contact with whomever you booked, so save that initial receipt. The hotel also allowed us late check out, 2pm, which was very helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was the most comfortable bed that I found throughout China. This bed was the least firm bed, which was great. There is a dent in the center of the bed, because I think pushed to double beds together, so beware. The bathroom was interesting in that you had a separate shower and a separate bathtub. The shower is enclosed in clear glass and the water pressure from the shower was medium. The shower head in the bathroom was malfunctioning in that the water was spraying all over the place despite my adjusting it. I finally gave up and only took showers in the clear glass shower and not the bathtub.The room was cleaned daily, and two complimentary small bottles of water were provided daily. There was nightly turn down service and you would get 2 cookies plus a small pastry or a piece of chocolate in a little red tin. That was a nice touch for a midnight snack. There is a mini-bar in the room, as well as a larger bottle of Evian bottled water that is not complimentary with the price clearly marked. Toiletries, hairdryer, refrigerator, and hot water heater for making tea were also provided. I used the refrigerator to store the orange juice I had bought at the grocery store. There was also TV in the room that had 4 English channels (CNN, HBO, National Geographic, and another news channel). Although my room was designated as non-smoking, I felt that there was cigarette smoke wafting into my room. The first day we checked in, our room had smelled like cigarette smoke. We left our window open all day, and finally, the cigarette smoke disappeared. When we turned on the heater, initially, there was a smoky odor, but after the heater was running for a while, the smoky odor disappeared. As with all the other hostels/hotels that we found in China, you have to put your room key card in the slot to activate the electricity in the room. It was easy to turn off all the lights in the room and leave the heater on overnight. There are control panels on either side of the bed. We also left one room card key in the slot but turned off all the lights during the day because we weren't sure if the refrigerator turned off if the room card key was removed. We were storing some small food items in the refrigerator. That worked well until the last 2 days, when housekeeping would take away that room key card in the slot during the day. We asked for a new room key card once, which we got, but the next day, the new room key card was taken again. By that time, we were almost ready to go, so we didn't ask for a second room key card. The hotel has a restaurant, and I ate there for lunch once and had their buffet. There was a mix of Western and traditional Chinese items. The food is typical of what you would see in an expensive hotel buffet. I would not eat there again unless I was pressed for time. There are other restaurants in and out of the area (accessible by Metro or taxi) that offered better and tastier food.The location itself okay as the hotel is in the Pudong district, which primarily caters towards business travelers. The Riverside Promenade is lovely both during the day and night. There is an excellent Superbrand shopping mall across the street (5 minute walk), which has a grocery store in the basement, 2 foreign language bookstores (you can buy English books here), and multiple different types of restaurants, including a food court on the 5th floor. The Jimao Tower, which offers excellent views of the city from the top, as well as the Shanghai Financial Center (highest view of the city) are all located in the Pudong district and easily accessed on foot (10 minute walk). Some of the fancier skyscrapers are located in the Pudong district and across the river in the Bund district.It is a 5 minute walk to the Pearl TV Tower and about a 7 minute walk to the Lujiazui Metro stop. The cheesy Bund Sightseeing Tunnel is also located right in front of the hotel entrance, and the tunnel allows you fast and easy, but cheesy access to the Bund district. The more touristy sites in Shanghai are in the Bund area, French Concession, or Old Town, all which are easily accessed by cab or Metro. To get to the Old Town though, it's much harder to use the Metro, but actually more fun to take the ferry (0.5 yuan). The ferry dock is located a bit south of the hotel, about a 12 minute walk, but once you're on the ferry, it takes 6 minutes to cross the river. During the day, the hotel is undergoing renovation/construction, so there can be a lot of noise from that. At night, our room was quiet. We faced the garden and did not have a riverfront view.The hotel also has a beautiful round pool and a small exercise room. The pool is too small for swimming laps, but the exercise room has a few cardio machines, but offers great views of the river. The hotel offers wi-fi in the room and on certain floors in the Convention Center. There is a 3 yuan per minute charge for internet if you use the Business Center. I am not sure what the wi-fi charge is, but I'm sure it may be costly. Overall, this hotel is geared toward the business traveler because of its location in the Pudong district. The touristy areas are easily accessed by taxi, Metro, Bund Sightseeing Tunnel, or even ferry. For a meeting at the Shanghai International Convention Center with higher end amenities and never having to walk outside, this is a great business hotel. If you want to be in the heart of the touristy area, then this hotel is a bit far from the action. Very pleasant business hotel. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Under renovation Business trip. The location is excellent, a brief walk to the Pearl Tower, Subway, Insect Museum, a large shopping mall (with many good eating places), the Bund and &quot;The Kitchen&quot; (a fantastic Italian restaurant on the Bund don't be put off if they say they are full, just walk up anyway). The hotel staff were really helpful with great language skills. The room was about 4 star internal level (rather than typical 4 star Asian). I would recommend the River side rooms if you have time to enjoy the view! TV was average, bed comfortable, bathroom OK but quite compact with separate shower. Internet access poor, renovation noise during the day (until evening!). I didn't eat at the hotel other than snacks/coffee in the lobby lounge. That lounge, and the Spa, were both very expensive for the quality offered. Try elsewhere! The Hotel is on the &quot;right&quot; side of the Bund for Pudong International Airport and about a 30 minute cab ride to the MagLev terminal. If you can handle walking with your luggage, stick to the Subways/Maglev etc. (Clean, fast, easy to navigate, safe...). You can always pick up a cab for any brief trip between the subway station and the hotel. Do follow advice given elsewhere and have any cab directions written down - the drivers are generally non-English speaking - and just repeating it louder doesn't help. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Great room but bad experience. I stayed in this hotel when I attended a congress at the Shanghai International Convention Center. The hotel was well placed for the congress. I booked my room through Expedia.co.nz which gave me a much better rate than either the congress booking or the hotel website.My room was on the 6th floor which is designated as a smoking floor. My booking had been for a room with a view of the river on the non-smoking floor. However, both with my reservation and with the reservations of others from the congress who stayed in the hotel, the request for a non-smoking room was ignored. The problem is that only the fourth floor is non-smoking and it fills up quickly. I was told repeatedly by the hotel that the views are poor from the 4th floor, but colleagues who stayed on the fourth floor reported that this is not the case.The room that I received had great views across the river, was well laid out and was very clean. I was quite pleased with the room. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom large and the furnishings nice. Housekeeping came into the room in the evening to drop off cookies and to give me a newspaper.However, I would never stay in this hotel again. First of all, Pudong is pretty soulless compared to the other side of the river. While there are lots of restaurants and shops on the Bund side, there are few inexpensive options in Pudong. The exception is the Watson’s grocery store which is located nearby which was a really good value for buying things. Each night, we took the subway to the other side of the river to eat.The breakfast at the hotel is Y180 which is highway robbery.The worst part is that for two nights, the hotel was having concrete poured on the roof. At 10PM, concrete trucks began pouring their loads into a machine that pumped it up to the roof. Until 2AM, the trucks were running and blowing their horns when they were out of concrete. The sound of the concrete was like someone rollerblading above my room. Plus I got a notice that there would be blasting 15m from my room and that I should not open my window. No high class hotel should be disturbing its guests with construction all night. They probably wont be pouring concrete again, but if they care so little about the comfort of their guests in this case, they probably wont care when other construction projects need to be carried out in the dead of night.So in summary, nice hotel if you are in Shanghai for a congress, but at a cost of sleep and dollars. Otherwise, look for other options. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Good choice Good hotel with good location. It is in Pudong waterfront promenade, with views to Bund and Pudong skyscapers. Very big and clean rooms with big bathroom. Huge lounge. Good breakfast.Only 200 meter to nearest metrostation, where you can reach to middle of Nanking shoppingstreet (next station) in a couple of minutes. Cost is 0,3 eur.Very big shopping mall is near by the hotel. "
oriental riverside hotel ,great place great location The Riverside Oriental Hotel a Great Hotel in a great Location rooms are big I stayed in a superior room but I did look at a standard all rooms are well finished. I could not find any faults airconditioning was good breakfast was wide and varied only problem is smoking ask for non smoking area. The tunnel under the river to the bund the old part of the city is right outside the hotel. The Hotel is in a quite part of Shanghai but close to attractions. I wll be staying at this hotel again. A nice touch was the bed was turned down at night and a few cookies and chocolate on the beside table. 
oriental riverside hotel ,"Perfect hotel in perfect location... just avoid August! Stayed her 10 nights in August, 2008. Great hotel, not too expensive but top-notch facilities and service. English not a problem at all with the staff. Room super nice, very clean, fantastic view overlooking the river... spent hours at night just watching all the neon-lit boats go by! Perfect location; just 2 blocks from a humongous mall with grocery store, so you can access all the modern stores and food chains, and the pedestrian tunnel to the other side of the river is literally on the front lawn of the hotel. The tall Pearl tower is also 2 blocks away.. nothing more than a 3-minute walk. Taxis out front to take you anywhere else in Shanghai, so plenty within a short walk, and (cheap and reliable) taxis to take you everywhere else! I'd never stay anywhere else...(Oh, but avoid August; VERY hot and VERY muggy...made it so hard to enjoy the outside and keep a positive attitude while touring or shopping.) "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Oriental Riverside Hotel: Very good Stayed four nights at this hotel in May 2008. Staff was very helpful. There was no language problem. The rooms were of good size and every thing worked. Great location-next to the Pearl tower and bund tunnel. The Super Brand Mall, a few minutes away had several nice restaurants (5th floor) including a terrific vegetarian restaurant and a grocery store (Lotus, in the basement). The Metro (line 2) is close by to go to Nanjing Road during rush hours. I would rate the hotel above average. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"A facility in decline The hotel had the feel of a facility in decline. My room was dingy and out-dated, power outlets and television didn't work. The room was very poorly ventilated--I awoke my first morning to a room full of exhaust fumes.The &quot;1930s&quot; restaurant in the lobby was mediocre with warmed-over institutional food and a staff that seemed confused as to what to do with a customer. The bar was poorly stocked and the bartender unable to fulfill basic requests. Another customer received his meal in reverse order. I would go again, however, just to see the jazz band that plays there nightly--they are dreadful to the point of hilarity as they muddle through one jazz standard after another.In general, the hotel staff seemed rather bewildered by the presence of guests with needs and expectations, and after the first night I felt it was a bad gamble to remain. We moved to another hotel in Pudong which turned out to be outstanding. "
oriental riverside hotel ,Impressive hotel Large bedroom and bathroom with wonderful view over the river and towards The Bund. Service from all staff was very courteous and attentive.We seemed to be the only western people there (an in fact in Shanghai!!) and had slight language problems. Staff spoke basic English but it was more difficult to communicate if there were problems. Very impressive exterior to this hotel but not easily accessible to Shanghai across the river.Breakfast OK - not much choice for the continental style. 
oriental riverside hotel ,"Great Hotel. Deserves higher rating. We've just back from Shanghai and I would love to write a review about this wonderful hotel. We booked five nights (one Deluxe room, River View and one Standard room, Garden view) and never regret it. The Deluxe room was very spacious. I loved the tasteful yet simple decoration and furniture, the big bathroom (with both shower and bath tube), the wonderful River and the Bund view and very good service. Our children stayed at the more modest Standard room but also had quite spacious room with gorgeous view (from their room you can see not the river only but Pudong skyscrapers including Jing Mao and the Pearl towers). Both rooms were very clean and very well maintained. The Standard room had a PC, the Deluxe room had an internet connection (2 yuan for a min). My husband checked his emails several times and paid 6 yuan for this service. You can also have free internet connection at the Element Fresh cafe at the Super Brand Mall (2 min walk from the hotel).The hotel's location was just perfect for us. It is located at the Bund in Pudong area at the Convention Center. If you prefer a quiet place to crowds and noise of Nanjin Road, this hotel is for you. The Pearl Tower (including quite interesting Historical Museum) and the Shanghai Aquarium is only 2 min walk from the hotel. The Pudong Bund and Sightseeing Tunnel is even less. The Metro station is 3 min walk. The Super Brand Mall with its gorgeous restaurants, cafes and shopping is just 2 min walk. They serve great breakfast at the Element Fresh cafe there.So, I highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay at a 5 star's hotel in a good location and if you get reasonable prices like we had (less than $90). Then it is just a SUPER VALUE. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Better than I anticipated too !! Stayed for 13 nights courtesy of a Travelocity pricing mistake ($27 per night) and firstly I am surprised that there were only 2 other reviews given the amount of western tourists at this hotel.The location is both it's greatest asset and also it's achilles heel depending on your requirements. It's on the Pudong (east) side of the river and most of the action takes place on the other side. However you soon notice how much quieter and calmer life is around hotel as the only traffic is the hotel's itself. The hotel is also just 3 mins walk away from the Super Brand Mall which has a Lotus Supermarket in the basement so you can stock up on drinks, snacks, etc. Lotus also have a reasonable hot food section and on the higher floor of this mall you can find KFC, McDonalds and Burger King along with many other restaurants.The rooms are good, not fantastic but certainly very nice with most of the usual amenities like tea making facilites. The beds were very comfortable. Seperate shower and bath although the shower door didn't close and bit of water leaked on the floor. I was a bit surprised there was no iron and ironing board but a quick call to reception and one was delivered in under 5 minutes. A 4 way electric adaptor was also sent up to my room in similar time. A bit puzzling was the maid who made up the room each day. Some days she would leave 2 bottles of water, some days 1, some days none. Same with shower amenities, didn't complain as it was just amusing to see what would be left. Using the internet was 120 RMB per day from within the room or 3 RMB per minute in the business centre. I had a laptop but one morning needed to print something so used the business centre. The printer was misconfigured (connected to the wrong network PC) and the lass managing the centre did not have a clue so I fixed it myself by simply unplugging it from the one wrong one and then plugging it into the correct one. Bit surprised then to be still charged 10RMB after fixing their problem !! The hotel also has some recreational facilities, some are included in the price and some are extra. The gym, sauna and swimming are included but tennis, snooker, table tennis, pool, 10 pin bowling and crazy golf are extra. Have to say that I thought paying 80 RMB for a 1 hour of snooker was a bit steep and out of nosiness I went down to basement a few times and there was never anyone in there.On the first couple of days we tried out both the buffet breakfast and buffet lunch. Breakfast was good but the lunch a bit disappointing. In fact on arrival 2 days before I decided to have a look at the lunch (we had arrived early 12noon and the room wasn't quite ready) and was quite impressed but on the day we visited, nearly all of the dim sum section had disappeared which was one thing I really wanted to enjoy. Also the sweet section was very limited.The staff were all very courteous and the fact that I spoke no Chinese didn't really impact on my staff as most spoke some English. I even had a haircut from someone who spoke no discernable English and received a great haircut.If asked would I stay again then would answer most definitely yes but I would be surprised if I visited Shanghai again soon as I was simply a tourist and saw everything I wanted. "
oriental riverside hotel ,"Better Than Expected I was attending a conference at the Shangri-La Hotel, just a few minutes away on foot. Unfortunately, the Shang was all booked out, so my travel agent suggested this place instead. It is hard to find (tell the Taxi drivers the 'Bin Jiang Da Jiu Dian' at the 'Shang Hai Guo Ji Hui Yi Zhong Xin') because it is a small adjunct of the Shanghai International Convention Centre. However, it was the place of the APEC meeting in 2001, and so it is quite regal, even if in a little bit of a gaudy way. The gym could be nicer and the health facilities kept up a little bit better but the room was faultless - large, with wonderful views of the Bund. The glass door shower was very nice, and the service was really impeccable. The location is also good as it is next to the Pearl Oriental Tower (which houses the Shanghai History Museum, which is quite interesting) and the Lujiazui subway stop.If you don't mind the quasi-Communist feel to the place with the over-the-top decor in the lobby (the rooms are fine and nice with great views) then it is not a bad choice actually for the Pudong/Lujiazui area. Mainland Luxe! "

pacific hotel ,"Loved the location We were on a textile tour and our US guide had been to China 32 times. So she knew Shanghai. The hotel is being remodeled so get a room facing the street. I had two different rooms on two different occasions and had no problems. Everything was clean and the rooms were huge. I could walk right out of the hotel across the street to People's Park and never felt unsafe. The breakfast buffet was huge. I loved their fried potatoes....and the tomatoes were very fresh. I also ate some of the regional vegetables and meat. I did not drink the coffee as it was very strong. I loved the stay there. I can still hear the street saxaphone player outside the window......I also had some laundry done for a reasonable price. It came back the same day, folded very neatly and ironed better than I could. I would definitely go back. "
pacific hotel ,"Lucky Dip On my second stay at this hotel I discovered why it gets some OK reviews and some bad reviews. The room I was given this visit was meant to be the same class as the one I had a month before but there was no comparison. The room had bare floors where the carpert was ripped out. I got a tin of insect spray delivered to my room to deal with the cockroach and bed bugs, the shower was broken, the bed was small. After a night wrapped in my own clothes for protection as I slept and extensive 'negotiations' at front desk I got the room I had last time - '502' - they bumped another person who had booked it. Same price but much larger and included carpet and some light.At its best this place is passable. At it's worse it's an experience never to forget. The staff are generally helpful and the 502 cleaner was good but never expect a smile or them to be distracted from their own conversations for your benefit (even if you speak mandarin!) They never say 'xie xie' or 'bu ke qi'. The same company runs Park Hotel which looks much better and is very close - maybe the reject staff end up here. "
pacific hotel ,"Disgusting and dirty do not stay here! We checked into this hotel in the afternoon and checked out the next day. The hotel is disgusting and dirty. I can tolerate an older style hotel, but dirtiness? No way. It was a huge let down to our holiday. We checked into the lovely 5 star hotel next door. The bathroom was so appalling that I refused to get into the shower. It was mouldy, dingy and reminded of a cheap backpacker hostel. "
pacific hotel ,"Convenient central location This hotel, just north of People's Park, is in an ideal location for first-time tourists. It is next to the junction of two major subway lines, and just a few blocks from both the Nanjing Road pedestrian mall and the Shanghai Museum. The lobby has the appearance of a former elegance that has faded away. Our rooms were furnished with two twin beds, and large enough so we did not feel cramped for space but small enough that it did not feel luxurious. The furnishings were old, but in good condition. It was warm when we stayed there (about 30C), and the air conditioning was barely adequate. The rooms initially had a slightly musty odor, but that seemed to dissipate. The rooms have ethernet connections to the internet; when we did not find a cable, we bought one for 10RMB (later, we found an ethernet cable in the desk drawer). The buffet breakfast was pretty good, but it cost 66RMB; there were lots of places just outside the hotel where you could get a much cheaper breakfast. For those with an ATM card from Bank of America, there is a China Construction Bank ATM located in the shopping mall on Nanjing Road two doors to the east. "
pacific hotel ,"Good location forget about luxury Visited Shanghai for the first time with 2 girlfriends. Excellent location, room was clean, good shower but that's about it. No luxury whatsoever, which was fine with us as we were out all day and just needed a place to sleep. Definitely not the place for you if you like to spend a lazy day in. But will not stay here again, prefer a little more luxury next time. "
pacific hotel ,"What a DUMP! Avoid this place!!! Just returned from a small group tour in China and had been suspicious of this hotel having read previous reviews on this website. (Sadly I had no choice since I was with a tour.) The only positive thing to be said about it is the location across from People's Square. The picture on their listing makes the hotel look glamorous with night lighting but don't let that fool you. The lobby looks elegant with it's vintage styling but that's as far as it goes. When we arrived I was given a dark, smoke scented and filthy room facing a dingy building. I immediately complained and was given a slightly &quot;better&quot; room on another floor, meaning that it didn't reek of smoke. I was too tired to move again but upon further inspection discovered old, decrepit scratched furniture with burn marks. Carpets were filthy and stained. Bathroom was grubby: moldy grout and caulking around tub and toilet. Window in bathroom was stained and not sealed. Furthermore there was no safe in either room I was in, although several members of our group had them, and had slighly cleaner brighter rooms than I did. (Most of the group was NOT happy with the accomodations.) Apparently there are a few remodeled rooms facing the street which, though noisy, at least had daylight. I stayed one night and woke up itching from some sort of bites on my head. There was no way I was going to stay in this place one more night, so I left and found a clean, modern and reasonably priced place elsewhere at my own expense. To add insult to injury, I later discovered that the front desk staff was completely useless at trying to locate guests. My husband attempted to call me several times and they said they couldn't find me on their roster. They had no record of my registration, and could not connect me to anyone in our group, in spite of the fact that they required our passports when we arrived. Forget it if there had been an emergency! I agree with the reviewer who mentioned not staying in older hotels in China. We stayed in a few other older hotels in China but they were cleaner and better kept. All the resources seem to be going into new properties in preparation for the 2008 Olympics. "
pacific hotel ,"Great base to explore Shanghai This hotel is nothing special - but then you're not paying top dollar for a room here. Hotel is well located just over the road from People's Square metro station (which is conveniently linked to Pudong International by a single simple change for the Maglev train at Longyang Road).The rooms were nothing special, but were well turned out and comfortable.The front desk were nothing special either, but were more than capable of translating addresses from English into Chinese for use with taxis.The hotel is not a place to spend oodles of time in. It is more suited as a place simply to sleep at. As such, I highly recommend it as a base for exploring based on its location and price. "
pacific hotel ,"Not worth it We stayed here for 4 nights in July. The good things first: breakfast was included in our hotel price and it was a decent spread of western and chinese food. The AC (a necessity in the hot summer months in China) worked well in our room. Location was great, across from the Metro and People's Square and right down the street from the flashy pedestrian shopping area and upscale mall. The minuses...I got a creepy feeling everytime I walked in due to the fact that the employees were always staring at us. I saw other westerners staying at this hotel and even after a couple of days after thet got to recognize that we were staying in the hotel, they still stared at us. The rooms are definitely old (marketed as old world European) but there's a difference between old and dirty, this place was both! The carpets were stained in the rooms and there were cracks on the walls and near the sink and shower. The last night we were there there was a constant drip near the mini bar, probably caused by the room above's AC. Given our limited knowledge of Chinese and the employees minimal knowledge of English, it was difficult to tell them that they needed to fix the problem. Overall, there must be a better deal in Shanghai than this place. The overall ambience was not worth spending the money on. "
pacific hotel ,"Great Location This hotel is wonderfully located in front of People Square (main museums, metro station), next to the main shopping street and if you like walking, you can do it all the way to the river or the french quater. My room was perfect and quiet. Interenet at the business center was ok.In the restaurant they are not very friendly. You can have your breakfast in the Stabucks only a block away.rates were good value for money and the staff at the front desk was helpful.I would easily go back th this hotel "
pacific hotel ,"Don't bother possibly the worst hotel in China! I've stayed in this hotel during my vacation my first time in Shanghai, China last year and it basically ruined my trip. I just had a conversation with a friend last week and she told she just had an exciting and wonderful time in Shanghai the week before and she told me she also stayed at a 2-3 star hotel but a new one! She told me to NEVER stay in a hotel that is not new because the maintence of hotels in China is not the best.... I've then decided that I need to give some guidance to fellow travellers before booking a hotel in Shanghai because it could basically make or break your stay in this city...also NO ONE should experience the horrible nightmare that we were in.I was travelling with my husband's family since they have some family friends in this city and we have decided to stay for a few nights. My sister-in-law booked this hotel thinking I would absolutely adore it since it's supposed to be built early in the century with Renaissance-esque decoration since I do adore anything that has some sort of antiquity to it. When we arrived, we were quite impressive with stone Roman Columns at the front entrance but it ends there...When we walked into the front entrance, the hotel looked like it was not maintained since it was built and the front desk was EXTREMELY slow, it took at least half an hour to check in and there is NO service for anything since we wanted to know if there is any local day tour or local attraction, their reply was always no or don't know....Our room size was decent but I felt like I was back in my dorm room in college with minimal amenities but the feeling is A LOT worst, at least my dorm room was clean. The windows open to a VERY DUSTY wall and we just keep the curtain close at ALL times. Also, the room is not well kept and the carpet looked filthy so we had to walk around in socks the whole time we were there (we threw our socks away at the end of the trip). The bathroom is okay but the crevices between the tiles in the bathtub is black. TV remote control had dirt all around the numbers and we had to use a towel to use it.... Believe me - I DID NOT put any of my clothes away and left them in the luggage at ALL times. I was joking to my husband that I need to go to a local supermarket to get some cleaning supplies and scrub this place clean!Actually, one incident that I will never forget comes when my husband realized he left his wallet behind after about 2 blocks away and we had to go back up to get it and guess what, they had already finished cleaning the room...we were amazed and not surprised given the above condition. Basically - we dreaded going back to the hotel every night and I cannot complain because my in-laws have already felt really bad... I've never felt happier checking out of ANY hotel. I've stayed at MANY hotels since I travelled a lot for business (have stayed from 6 stars to 1 star hotel) but this is one of the worst hotel I've stayed in. "
pacific hotel ,"What a Great Place to Stay!!! I will certainly stay here next time I go to Shanghai! The location is absolutely awesome, right at the intersection of East and West Nanjing Roads. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and, while their English is not what you could call &quot;bilingual,&quot; they do their best to be completely responsive to your needs. The hotel itself has all the amenities in a lovely old Italianate style hotel. If they put in new carpeting they could easily upgrade to a 4 star! It was wonderful to have a free internet laptop in my room. I stayed there for 4 days and never used the restaurant because there was too much available outside the hotel in easy walking distance. Everything in my room was clean and in perfect condition. Don't be afraid of the bad review of this hotel. It is above average for the price and you could never beat the location. "
pacific hotel ,Great location and room with a view My family spent five days at the hotel and found location to be excellent. We paid for a better room facing the front and it was worth the extra. Everything in the room was great including the internet connection to my notebook. my friend had a single room in the back which was quieter than the front but looks into a dirty courtyard with debris. The restaurant standards are average but there is a famous eating street two minutes walk away.This hotel is excellent for location and facet for a reasonable price. It is an old building with slightly worn carpets and decor so don't expect the same shine as the Radisson hotel next door. I will use this hotel again for the location and ambience of people's square. Note that this hotel is inconvenient for handicap or wheelchair. 
pacific hotel ,"Not Even a 3 Star I was unfortunate enough to stay here because my travel agent could not book me in any where else. This hotel was built in 1928 and at that time it would have been outstanding - but it is no longer. This hotel is in desperate need of a serious make over as everything is tired and worn out. I stayed in two different rooms, a suite and a twin share. In the suite I turned over the bed spread and it had stains that looked to me as though they could be bodily fluids. The beds are hard but that is the case right throughout China. The showers water pressure resembled a hose and that was in both rooms. The rooms are clean overall but the grout in one of the bathrooms was really dirty. The breakfast buffet caters more to eastern tastes but there is a western menu available which consists of coffee, toast and ceral. I stayed away from the milk but I am always sceptical of dairy products in Asia. Coffee and tea facilities in room is Chinese Tea. Cable T.V is HBO and BBC world news and about 50 other Chinese stations. The best things about this hotel is the location but if you want to eat western food go next door to the Radisson. "

parkyard hotel shanghai ,Lovely hotel and great value This is a very nice looking new trendy hotel. The service is OK. The rooms are roomy and clean. If you have business in the area this is a great value hotel.The pool is long and narrow - the best I have seen for a Hotel to do laps. 
parkyard hotel shanghai ,"One of the best business hotels in Shanghai I travel to Shanghai moderately often on business. The Parkyard is ideally suited to people doing business in the Zhangjiang industrial park (Lenovo, Flextronics, Valeo, and many other international high tech firms). It is a bit off the &quot;beaten path&quot; if you are headed out at night for dinner with clients and colleagues, but the organic restaurant in the train station next door has excellent food and is fine for casual dining (and I'm really picky about Asian cuisine).The hotel is almost new, with a solid 4-5 star level of furnishings and decorations. The layout tends to a cross between German modern and contemporary Chinese serene. Unlike some other expensive Shanghai hotels, staff is generally well trained (except the shoe shine service, which was horrible ... the put lots of polish on the shoes, but then didn't buff it off!). The heath club really is a health club with a nice lap pool, exercise room and quality &quot;real&quot; massage service. Breakfast is very good, if sometimes crowded. The house coffee is not good, use the automatic capuccino machine instead.The only caveats; there are a block of rooms along one side of the hotel that are situated along a very noisy/busy sidewalk (I think it's ChenHui Road). There's a 8' privacy wall, but it doesn't help if you want to sleep in. Always request a room with a window to one of the interior courtyards.Price: I think it's one of the best values in Shanghai, even when you factor in the cost of a taxi to PuDong or PuXi. "
parkyard hotel shanghai ,"Quite nice just some small little problems... I stayed in this hotel 3 times since Oct 2007. As the previous poster pointed out, it's a new hotel and is very close the Zhangjiang industrial park where some international companies are located. I stayed there for the same reason.It's also very near to the subway station, about 5 mins' walk, to the right of the hotel.As far as the hotel is concerned, the bell hops are all very polite, helpful and cheerful. Two of them remembered me and when I last stayed - that was quite impressive!!The hotel is a business hotel with only one restaurant which serves breakfast and dinner with a limited menu. The breakfast is good with a great variety. Now dinner is average and pricey so just step out of the hotel and walk to the food and entertainment area next to the hotel (literally next door - subway, starbucks, Chinese restaurants, etc)I like the fact that the lobby is chic, minimalistictic and smells good all the time. The rooms are spacious with the same minimalist style. Internet is free of charge and works very well.The only problem with this hotel is HOUSEKEEPING - for my 1st and 3rd (most recent) stay, I needed to call the housekeeping back to do the clean up again. There was hair, watery stain and patches of sticky stuff on the writing desk this time.The manager was very apologetic and explained that it was because they were running full house, which could be true. I was eventually upgraded to an executive suite because there was no other room available that night. In that room though, the phone didn't work.These small little issues prevent me from giving this hotel a rating of 5. I do look forward to staying at this hotel again because the staff is friendly (except for the staff at breakfast).By the way, if you are coming back to the hotel from Puxi area, make sure that you bring the hotel's address. Most drivers on the other side of the city doesn't know this hotel. Tell them it's next to the subway station. I will post pics later...hope this helps! "
parkyard hotel shanghai ,"Great place to stay for ZhangJiang I booked several nights for a business delegation to Pudong, and this was an ideal hotel for our needs. There was great attention to our every request, and the staff were beyond helpful. The hotel is new, and since it is at the last Subway stop in Pudong, relatively quiet (i.e., no tourists) - which was, again, perfect for our group. As it was located right next door to the Zhangjiang station, our commute to Puxi and other locations was simple and efficient. "
parkyard hotel shanghai ,Hotel Parkyard Shanghai. 
parkyard hotel shanghai ,Non credo lo consiglierei... 
park hotel shanghai ,"Great Location Cheap hotel Werid smell This is really a weird hotel, sure some parts of it needs renovation.Good things: It has a great location, subway (People Sq) is 1 min walk from hotel, 10 min walk from a large shopping area, size of single rooms are good, cheap price compared to its ratings, helpful stuff.Bad things: very smelly reception and base floor, average room cleanness (good compared to China standard), very very noisy areaOverall I recommend it. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Nice but half old! Hard to tell about my feelings about this hotel. Good location but quite noisy. Very nice room...so you might wonder what is wrong ? something in the mood of that hotel - new build on old...sometimes it gives very good results but in that particular case, it gives a starnge feeling. My phone was not working, I tried to explain the problem at the reception but gave up after some minuts. For the price I got on internet and considering it is in Shanghai, maybe ok but next time, I will try an other hotel. Breakfast cost about 100 RMB. If you have a rate without breakfast and eat breakfast there, staff gets very nervous...3 persons asks me 'what is your room no ?' within 5 minutes. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Hotel with history- great location and good value Even though it's no longer the tallest building in Shanghai and you wouldn't spot it immediately (all dark on outside, not shiny and all glass), this hotel offers tourists a perfect location right at Ren Min Park, only minutes on foot from Nanjing West Road where all the shopping malls are located. Rooms are clean (except for one cockroach in bathroom, having lived there for hundreds of generations since 1934, I guess) and service is ok. Try to book online as prices vary a lot! "
park hotel shanghai ,"Stay clear of this one Well, it is noisy.The service at the front desk was a little too stand off / I don't care.The door man couldn't be bothered to help with luggage to the room.The room appeared nice at first. But after looking closer, there was femail hair on the bathroom floor. The tub was scratched. The towels were frayed around the edges and when I pulled one off the towel rack, there was a little tiny bug on it....could it be a tick? Now I am itching myself every five minutes!! I am staying here right now as I type this and doors are slamming and you can hear people in the room next to me.The location is great, but compared to what I have stayed at in China, this one is pretty high priced for what you get in return (but it's also the lowest one on I found on this strip). "
park hotel shanghai ,"Local Insights Hmmm! A dated old hotel that needs to learn about customer service. I was checked into a 'Corner' room on the 18th floor which was clean and had a great view and an updated bathroom and shower. However, there was no hot water. When I complained I was told they were fully booked but would change me the next day and yes, they knew that the 18th floor had no hot water... but hadn't bothered to mention it . Moved to a non-smoking room on a lower floor that had cigarette burns in the carpet and wasn't overly clean but at least was large!The buffet breakfast was terrible, no choice or quality. Staff had very limited English and communication was hard going. The location wasn't bad and it was less expensive than the nearby Sheraton. "
park hotel shanghai ,NOT Recommended: Smelly old hotel but well known hotel for locals I selected this hotel in the internet after considering its great location and reasonable prices. I stayed there for 4 nights in 2007. The lobby was smelly with smoke. Old decoration. Limited services. 
park hotel shanghai ,"Quaint and historic but substandard I was booked by a business associate and had no say over the choice of hotel. If I come back I'd definitely stay somewhere else, although the Park is a fascinating piece of Shanghai history and has been renovated up to Western standards, more or less. When I checked in I was advised I had been upgraded to a suite, only to find myself in a large rather spartan room overlooking a three-story video monitor right outside my window! It flooded the room with blinding light at 7 p.m. The blackout curtains helped, and the video is turned off around 11 p.m.Then there was no hot water the following morning, and the following today I woke up to absolutely no electricity. The hotel fixed it, but suffice it to say if it's consistent quality you want, this ain't the place. But it has character that the new steel-and-glass hotels don't have. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Historical hotel in need of a renovation I just came back from a visit in Shanghai and we stayed in the Park Hotel near Nanjing Square. The Park hotel has some historical significance (it was the tallest building in Shanghai for some time) and its location is great because of it's proximity to Nanjing Square which is a pedestrian only shopping area with lots of food and retail shops around. Also, the subway is just across the street from the hotel.The downside is the room. The size of our room on the 5th floor was large, however, it reeked of smoke and you could tell that the carpet has seen much better days. definitely use slippers when walking around the room. Grouting and tile in the bathroom could also use some updating as well. Also, the television had plenty of english channels which was nice.The hotel lobby looked great, but don't be fooled. As other reviewers have noted, this self proclaimed 4 star establishment is much closer to a 3 star. The gym is outdated and the business center was extremely expensive to use the computer and make a few printouts. Great location, sub par rooms, and not the best amenities. I would recommend staying elsewhere for your money. "
park hotel shanghai ,"AVOID...! Having read the other reviews i can't fault the location, it was nice to be right in the center of the city but the hotel somehow of the other didn't quite appeal to me...I chose it because having stayed in china for over 3 weeks in diff hotels thought i might as well look for a more reasonable option but i still regret it til date!The Lobby seemed ok in the evening when i had come in to check in, but after i paid my deposit and went up to my room i was hugely dissapointed by the size of the room but still didn't mine, it was also extremely noisy but that was ok, but there was a problem in the airconditioning system and it was extremely noisy and also some leakages in the bathroom. I complained to the reception a few times, they finally sent someone up to see the problem but still didn;t do anything so finally hours later i went downstairs to the reception and complained again, having had to argue with the guy for over half an hour i asked for my deposit back so i would go to another hotel nearby but he refused to help me but instead offered me a business room for a high rate, which he finally accepted togive at the same rate. This hotel was definitely much better but was on a corner of the building so was shaped very strangely , either way i didn't really care as i was only there for 1 night, the bathroom was clean and spacious so i thought it was better just to manage, also it had a computer there and internet connection at no extra cost.In the night i went out and realised that the entire hotel entrance is filled with homeless people and people offering karwoke and massages and what not. Even leabing the hotel was harrasment as little kids would grab onto my legs demanding money, this was much worse when i cam eback in at the end of the night, realy not worth saving that extra money to go throuhg all that..The next morning i had called up requesting for a later check out which the receptionish agreed till 2 so at quarter to 2 i asked for someone to come up an dhelp me with my luggage but was kept waitiunf for 45 minutes untill i finally came down muself with the luggage, waitinf ro the life alone took me another 5minutes, finally when checking out the lady said i was too late to check out as checkout time is 11 so they are going to charge me half a days rate for late check out, I told her about the lady from the reception allowing me until 2, which they refused to believe, it got a point where they called out the owner and they said they was no recordof anyone speaking to me, finally after arguing for another 20mins they agreed to waive this extyra charge but still didn't believe me claiming that they never allow check out later then 11!Overall a very strange and dissappointing experience, i think a lesson has been learnt here not to go for cheap hotels in China, I had even asked owner why he allowed all guests to be harassed by people when leaving and ebntering hte hotel at night but he just laughed, not sure iof he understood what i was sayingt to him even! "
park hotel shanghai ,"Great value option I would absolutely return.The hotel is actually a small piece of history as it is one of the oldest in Shangai. All in all it is well kept and a nice find! Great service and a comfortable setting.The Hotel is just off the famous Nanjing shopping district and within walking distance (for those who don't mind a bit of a walk) of &quot;The Bund&quot; district. The only complaints were the small, HARD (not firm), HARD beds, but I've found that to be somewhat common in China. The rooms are typically small (like those in most European Hotels), but comfortable. Great tip - this hotel is about 100m from the Raddisson Hotel. The Raddisson has a large rotating restaurant on the 45th floor (think space needle or CN tower). Unbelievable view and good food. Enjoy lunch or dinner. Doesn't open until 11:30 am. "
park hotel shanghai ,"An Old Standard The Park must have had a renovation since some of the earlier reviews posted here. We found it clean and up-to-date, and looking younger than its long history might suggest. Its location is as good as it gets and it appears that all the new competition is keeping the Park’s rates modest. There are many new choices around that are more exciting, but don’t rule out the park because you are afraid it is old and run down. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Try Central Hotel Pro: its locationCon: noisy, old, smelly, service all below averagei recommend Central Hotel located at Jiu Jiang Rd near Nanjing Rd, it's a newer and cleaner and better service hotel "
park hotel shanghai ,"Two rooms - one hotel The first room I received was on the 3rd floor which is non-smoking. It was a very large corner suite. The windows are single pane and it sounded like the traffic outside was coming through my room. The bed was the worst of the three hotels in China I stayed at. I spoke to the front desk eand was moved to the 12th floor. The upper floors are business rooms and my room had a computer. The room had been remodeled and I could barely hear the traffic noise. Once I changed rooms I really began to enjoy my stay. The breakfast buffet was ok, but no ther amenities - this is an old hotel. Lots of foreign tourists were there. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Good Location but can be noisy We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in the centre of Shanghai . The setting was ideal, right on the edge of Peoples Square and we enjoyed walking round it (and underneath where there is an enormous shopping precinct aimed mainly at teenagers).The hotel was a superb art deco period piece and apparently had been Mao's favourite hotel in Shanghai.We were given an upgrade -a massive suite of rooms,however there was a lot of noise (traffic and people shouting right through the night from the adjoining street at the back of the hotel). The bed and bathrooms were of a high qualityThe breakfasts were OK but not as good or varied as at some of the other places we stayed at "
park hotel shanghai ,oldcodgers Arrived at hotel tired after a long flight only to find that they did not have our booking. WE BOOKED THIS LAST NOVEMBER. After 40 minutes the girl on the desk decided to give us a room for the night but informed us that we would have to take it up with the booking agent in the morning. We told her in no uncertain terms that this was not acceptable and insisted on speaking to the Manager who appeared after the 4th time of insisting. He apologised using the excuse that the girl was new to her job and immediately upgraded us to a suite to compensate for our upset. This hotel must certainly have been grand in its heyday but now is a very tired old lady in great need of a makeover. The staff in front were very polite and eager to help with tours and taxis etc but the staff in the restaurant certainly needed training. All they seemed to be interested in was pushing plates around and only responded when we tried to serve ourselves with tea and coffee. Plates of food were not recharged on the buffet and each day we had to ask for items. NOT GOOD. Cleanliness was average overall. Certainly would not grade this as a 4 star. The good thing was the locality of the hotel - covenient. Was fun watching the excercisers in Peoples Square right oposite our room. 
park hotel shanghai ,"Great Value The hotel may be old, but the service and the room facilities are certainly up to a 4 star hotel standard. We arrived at the hotel and were immediately upgraded to an excutive room (without any reason or charge). Our room overlooked the People Park from th 14th floor, which was a great treat. The room was in pretty good shape with a PC and wireless free of charge (for this level of rooms). Breakfast is not very impressive, but there is really not much choice if you wish to eat out in the vicinity. The hotel is right in front of the 2 major subway lines which is great to travel around the city if you are keen to use it. Access to cab is also very convenient being located on a major intersection. 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East Road (the famous pedestrian walk). The staff were generally friendly, especially when you are polite to them. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Tired Hotel but Central Location The Park Hotel on Nanjing Road is a block away from the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Walking street. The hotel’s glory days are in the past. The exterior of the hotel is showing its age. When entering from the pedestrian walking street the most noticeable signage to the hotel is the Bank of China sign. The bank takes up the east side of the ground floor of the hotel so the hotel entrance is obscured. Also the hotel entrance is at a multi-road intersection so taxis cannot queue for a spot. The taxi queue is actually a half a block away to the east in front of the Radisson New World Hotel. Inside the lobby is rather dark, unappealing, and smelly of both an old hotel and of smoke. The lobby is rather dated and worm and needs a major remodel. Some English is understood by the hotel staff. The elevator is quick but small. The room was very spacious with all the amenities including a kettle, minibar, free water bottles, TV, blowdryer, and safe. A major disappointment was the carpet of the room was worn and wrinkled. It seems the carpet was at least 15 years old maybe 20 years old and should be immediately replaced. The bathroom was a total disappointment. The tiles on the bathroom were old. The grout caulking was graying/blacking and unappealing. The ceiling of the bathroom showed evidence of the water leak and was poorly patched; very unappealing. The hot water took at least 10 minutes to warm up. The free water bottles were necessary because the Shanghai water smelled of remnants of sewage with a very unappealing odor and taste. Do not drink the tap water unless thoroughly boiled and then that should be avoided if possible. The air quality in the room was poor. Though it was a non-smoking room it was not a non-smoking floor so the smokers from the other rooms made the room smell bad.The hotel bills itself as four stars. Overall at about $US130 (final price all tax in) a night at peak season the Park Hotel can be considered a poor choice for a four star hotel and is not recommended at this price if you want a 4 star hotel. You should pay more and get the quality that is desired for a 4 star hotel. The Park Hotel grade is “3 star” out of 5 stars. If you want to pay at this price point and get an acceptable but run-down hotel then this place is okay.Pros: Good shopping location, close to transit Metro station, helpful front desk staffCons: Outside lobby entrance is small and not noticeable, close to busy and noisy traffic intersection, no full non-smoking floors, air quality in lobby is musty and smoky, air quality in non-smoking room is musty and some smoke coming over from the smoker rooms. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Very good hotel great location Spent two nights in this hotel in October 2006. Room could do with some renovation, but was very comfortable and spacious with everything you needed - TV, radio, air con, broadband (not wireless), mini-bar, coffee machine. Air con was perhaps slightly noisy. Also worth asking for a room with a view to Remnibi square, mine had average view at the back. Staff was very helpful, front desk spoke perfect English. Did not try the restaurant or any of the other facilities so can't comment on them. Location is excellent, right on Remnibi square for access to the sites there, metro station and very easy to get taxis or even the bus if feeling adventurous. Would definitively stay there again if I find it at the same price. Highly recommended. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Great deal for the single traveler For many years, the Park Hotel was the tallest building in Shanghai and probably in China. It is located right at People's Square, close to the city's best museums, and right at the intersection of the two subway lines for easy transportation. The breakfast buffet is also very good. A small business center and travel agency provide important services. This 1930s hotel has lots of charm and--most importantly--a terrific price on the hotel's website for a single room. (Larger rooms are much more pricey.) All in all, well worth serious consideration. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Art Deco Classic My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Park Hotel in late May, 2006. If you like hotels with character, this is a good choice. The Park Hotel is well located on Nanjing Road, across the street from a subway stop, and near shops and restaurants. The lobby and the restaurant areas are art nouveau gems from the turn of the century. The wood paneling and light fixtures in the restaurant are particularly stunning. Our room was on the ninth floor. It was small and somewhat cramped, but attractively furnished and very comfortable. There was a built-in closet, dresser with t.v., small table and reading chair. This particular room even came with a computer and high-speed internet access. The tiled bathroom was small but adequate, with a tub-shower combination. There was very little counter space. The breakfast buffet was extensive and very good. We had dinner at the hotel one night and although it was ok, there are probably better choices nearby. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Park Hotel has it all Just returned from Shanghai and the Park Hotel. Hotel has everything -- great location-across from very usable subway (signs and announcements in English) ,beautifully landscaped People's Park, Nanjing Rd.(main shopping street), and Shanghai Art Museum. Hotel very clean. Beautifully restored Art Deco public areas. Get deal with buffet breakfast included-served in beautiful Deco main dining room. Staff English skills from poor to good depending on who you speak to. Our room had double-paned windows and no noise. Bed and bedding very comfortable. Right in back of hotel are local Chinese restaurants with English menus. Nearby are lanes with fascinating traditional life going on. Would definitely recommend this hotel for comfort, price, and location. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Good location but noisey Stayed here at the end of april for 4 nights. This hotel is ideally located for the Nanjing Road shops, underground/subway &amp; walking to the Bund.The hotel still has the charms of the 1930s when it was built but unfortunately does not have double glazing so it sounds like you are sleeping on the street. The Chinese drivers like to use their horns every 10 seconds ! Make sure you get a room on the highest floor possible. Beds are typical Chinese style - very hard, but this seems to be the thing at all hotels.Breakfast room is amazing and the food is good also. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Good value for money The location couldn't be better. It's near the main shopping pedestrian mall and just opposite the subway. Free internet access on desktop machines in the room was a big hit with my teenage children. Lots of good eateries nearby. No major grouses. For what we paid, it was very good value. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Not bad Location: Outstanding. Near the subway, Ningjing shopping street, local eateries and shops, a short walk to starbucks and a very great bar called Barberossa or so behind starbucks.Room:A bit dated. Had problem with air con - it blew out too much heat that we couldn't breathe. Called room service/ operator for help but they didn't show up. We finally had to sleep with windows open. Service:We slept three in the room. But they provided only two sets of amenities till i made a request. Overall, staff are very nice and helpful. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Park Hotel - Convenient Location I am writing from my hotel room via the free internet service. The hotel is centrally located, opposite the People's Square metro station. There are many inexpensive restaurants/cafes and lots of major departmental stores within the vicinity. I enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The only slight 'complaints' that I might have of the hotel are the lights are very dim and on the first day the room had a very strong smell of cigarettes (although I was given a non-smoking room) and the toiletries are not exactly the best, given the price of the hotel. In addition, non-smoking rooms are located on the lower levels and in the mornings, it's quite noisy.In general, if you are looking for a hotel that is strategically located and within a medium price range, this would be one of them. "
park hotel shanghai ,Customer service left a lot to be desired I was disappointed with the level of service I received at this hotel. The hotel offers money changing facilities for guests yet front desk staff refused to change currency saying that the notes were old tender (they were not). Coffee and tea making facilities were provided in the room but we were charged for the 4 sachets of sugar we requested as none was provided in the room. Staff refused to remove the charge from my bill even though we were paying over £70 a night for the room. This is not the kind of service I would expect from a 4 star hotel and was a disappointing end to a good holiday in China. 
park hotel shanghai ,"Great Hotel! This hotel is located right at the top of the shopping area on Nanjing Street and is probably about a 30 mins walk from The Bund (the end of the Nanjing shopping area). The Shanghai theatre is about 5 mins walk and the area is very lively but not noisy. The rooms are comfortable, clean and well decorated and the concierge is amazing. They were able to help us plan our weekend there and saved us quite a bit of money by arranging taxis for us instead of taking tours which are often costly and not necessarily informative in China (beware of hotel tours, a number of them will take you to commercial stops such as silk and jade factories and Chinese Medicine clinics to pressure you to spend money). All the staff were wonderful and a shuttle bus is available from the airport to drop you within walking distance of the hotel. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Shanghai given its ideal location and good service. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Great location and wonderful park view I am writing this review from my room in the Park Hotel: there is a computer and free internet connection. My week-long stay here has been very enjoyable. It is a great location--the Union Square of Shanghai (with the Met [Shanghai Grand Theatre] thrown in). The Remin Square Metro station is across the road (it's a central hub for the two main lines). I asked for a room looking out over Remin Square--and even from the third floor it is a fantastic view. It's a big room, with double windows, looking over the park and city lights at night. Ask for room #303! It has cost me around RMB950 (+15 % tax) per night: the same as if I had a room at the back of the hotel. It's a bit more than I had intended to pay; but it has been worth it. The hotel, unfortunately, has little art deco left: the rooms are aesthetically ordinary, but comfortable (the beds are real hard, but I have liked that). I also considered the Yangtze Hotel: but as of Sep 2005 there is still a lot of construction work going on there. It could be some time before that dies down. I also thought about the Ruijin Guesthouse, in the French Concession; its more money, but lovely if you want a bit of piece and quiet. While the Park is a great central location for sight-seeing, there aren't a lot of great restaurants within easy walking distance (wonderful exception: Kathleen's 5, across the way); there are good local joints, but you'll likely need chinese to negotiate that. If you aren't going to stay at one of the top-end-of-town hotels, this is a really good option to consider. "
park hotel shanghai ,"Grand old dame in the heart of Shanghai The Park Hotel located on Nanjing West Road in downtown Shanghai is one of the grand old hotels of a byegone era - an era when Shanghai used to be separted into the French and British concessions. Built in classical European style, the lobby exudes a stylish elegance reminiscent of the 1930s when the hotel was the zero center point of Shanghai. The elegant dining room is spacious with a commanding view of the city. The rooms are huge and clean. At around US$90 for a double room, it is excellent value for money as it is located just directly across People's Square, the transportation hub of Shanghai and 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East pedestrian mall, leading to the famous Bund. Behind the hotel, there are numerous small eateries where the locals patronise - you should be able to read Chinese if you decide to patronise any of these eateries as there is no English menu. "

park hyatt shanghai ,"Above the clouds Don’t be mislead by the title, my stay in the Park Hyatt is not like walking on cloud 9, in fact you can say it’s the opposite. I am just stating the fact that at being on the top floors on one of the tallest building in the world, it is literally above the clouds. Date of Stay: November 26,2009Room Type: Park RoomUpgrade: noneAmount Paid Per Night: 2,080RMB (300USD) plus taxesReservation Method: Goldpassport WebsiteLoyalty Card: Platinum Gold PassportAirport/Hotel Transfer: Arranged for an Audi transfer from the hotel, I find this the best way in China because sometimes taxi lines are too long and you might be left standing in the cold for at least an hour. Unlike Park Hyatt in Beijing that met me on the Airport Gate itself and escorted us through immigration and customs the Hyatt representative (Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt and Hyatt on the Bund) was waiting for us at the arrival area outside the customs section.Location: I never liked staying in Pudong because it’s just too far from anything…and traffic is horrendous but with the 2 new tunnels connecting Pudong with Puxi, getting from the hotel to Puxi could be as little was 10-15 minutes. Park Hyatt is on the top floors of the Shanghai World Financial Center, from the ground floor you go up to the lobby at the 87th floor and you take elevators down to rooms from the 79th to the 84th floors.Check-in: Was very fast, we were met at the ground floor and escorted to the lobby and was in our room in less than 10 minutes.Room: Quite large, I like the open feel without making it too open that I loose my privacy like the Park Hyatt in Beijing. The real problem is the huge diagonal pillar which is part of the building’s structure taking up almost half the window view. and it also made the room look smaller because it pushed the day bed much closer to the bed.Bathroom: The bathroom was big, the rain shower is twice the size of the regular rain showers and is inclosed in a very roomy shower area with a big bathtub. Toiletries are from Aromatherapy (just like the Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong).Bed: Bed was very comfortable not really too soft and not hard either, I have to say it’s just right. The pillow are another thing, I wish I had enough strength to request for additional pillows because those huge square pillows were hard to manage. I literally had to fold them so I could sleep.Breakfast: compared to other hotels in Asia, I have to say the breakfast spread is adequate albeit very limited. But the great thing is where they serve breakfast, they call it Dining Room, and when you enter the place they made a nice little kitchen with cabinetry and stovetop like ones you see at home or condo. you pass through a doorway into the actual Dining Room with a nice view of Pudong.Check-out: Check out was fast and efficient, nothing much to write about it actually, they did apologize for the room over and over but it’s really a bit too late for that.Overall Evaluation: Service is excellent there no doubt on that, I said the same thing when I spoke to the Director of Rooms the following morning after I sent him an email about the diagonal pillar on the room and told him that I am moving to Peninsula across the river. However I felt that as a Platinum member I’m entitled to something more, plus the fact that my membership guarantees the best available room on the category…and I do not think that was the best at that time. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Beautiful Hotel Indeed but bad arrival experience The Park Hyatt is the premium luxury brand of the Hyatt Chain, and positioned itself as premium luxury hotels in same class as Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton. Occupying the 79th to the 87th floor of the Shanghai World Financial Centre, the Park Hyatt Shanghai can boast of being the highest hotel in the world with the fame and novelty to go with it. It is also the most expensive hotel you can find in Shanghai with starting rates comparable to and in most case exceeding the most expensive hotels in Hong Kong. I rarely try any hyatt hotels because my past stays at Hyatts have all turned out to be a total disaster, to the extend that I usually go out of the way to avoid this chain. However, despite my previous several unpleasant experience with the Hyatt Chain, this hotel is generating enough hype that I was eager to give this hotel a try just to see if it does live up to it’s reputation. Bad arrival experienceUnfortunately, from the get go, history seems destined to repeat itself. My arrival experience at this hotel left me unimpressed, unwelcome, underwhelmed and annoyed. On arrival, a bell boy ( which strangely was dressed smartly in tie and suit ) took my luggage bag and I was shown to the hotel’s speed elevator, which whizzed quickly in less than a minute to the 87th floor. The lobby indeed was quite impressive, but the weather was foggy hence not doing justice to the view. The check-in desk seems to be understaffed and there was a queue forming for check-in, not a good sign of a supposedly top-tier luxury hotel. Upon check-in, I told the check-in lady staff that I have earlier requested by email for a room facing west towards Puxi and Jinmao tower which has the best view. I was immediately told this room wasn’t available because the hotel was “fully booked” but I’m sure she did not bother to check. Then I was told breakfast wasn’t included in my room rate ( it was ) and only after showing my booking, then she relented. Next she spend several minutes staring at her computer screen apparently “hunting” for a suitable room (??? ). Finally, I was next told the room wasn’t ready because they have to “put some fresh fruits” in the room first. And I was assured it would only take 5 mins and she will informed me once ready and show me to my room. I was invited to wait in their “living room” which is the hotel lounge. After 10 mins passed, no sign anyone is coming. Frankly, I’m not used to waiting at all for check-in when staying at luxury hotels. If it’s Holiday Inn or even a Hilton, fine, but this is the Park Hyatt. So I approached the front desk again asking where’s my room and was dismayed to find out that apparently, the room was ready a while ago, just that the lady who checked me in left the desk and forgotten that I was still waiting at the lounge. Another staff then handed me the room keys and wish me a good stay. No escort to room or they must have forgotten. Upon entering, the room at first glance was indeed very impressive. It’s cutting edge modern contemporary and remind me of another hotel with similar styling, the Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong. However, a quick check on the room and I soon noticed significant wear and tear. Worst, the showerhead have ugly brown spots and the bedsheet have some brown stains. Yucks! Totally not acceptable! I immediately called Guest Service to complain and was promised they will send someone to check and clean it soon. Looking around the room, I hunt for the light switches and couldn’t find them ( it was hidden beside the bed ) and I couldn’t find the lights for the toilet cubicle which was very dark. The remote for the TV is hidden so I couldn’t switch on the TV. A lot of stuff are just not very intuitive in this room. Someone should have shown me the room being my first step here. Another 10 mins passed and nobody come to my room yet to attend to my complaints. Also, my luggage wasn’t brought up. It’s starting to irritate me. Calls to guests service several times and they will say “I will check” but it’s a different person answering the call each time, which means I have to repeat the story. Getting seriously annoyed, I started to ask for the Manager on Duty. Shortly after, the assistant manager showed up and apologized, and promptly got the room cleaned and arranged the luggage to be brought up. The duty manager also came to apologize, and offer another room which has a better view and in much better condition ( much less wear and tear ). I took the opportunity to lecture them that since Park Hyatt positioned itself as a top-tier luxury 5star hotel ( and they certainly priced accordingly ), such service hiccups and housekeeping sloppiness are totally unacceptable. Furthermore, as a first time guest, I should be escorted to the room to explain the technology and features, not left me to figure things for myself. Both were very apologetic and said they will feedback my comments to management. The RoomI booked a Park King room which measures a spacious 50-55m2 and decorated in cutting edge contemporary style. Everything feels very zen and there is a great view of Puxi and Jinmao tower. Unfortunately, it was quite foggy during my stay but that was not the fault of the hotel. I particularly love their closet design which has really cool lighting feature and each door can be folded inwards for easy accessibility or covered for privacy. There isn’t much furniture in the room, just a TV, a nice work desk, a day bed by the window and a small side table hence it feels very spacious. All the usual hotel amenities ( toiletries, towels, stationary etc ) are there but kept out of sight, hidden in boxes or behind doors which make the room feel uncluttered but frankly gets rather annoying at times if you are a first time guest hunting for stuff. The bathroom has dual vanity and a separate “wet room” which houses a fabulously large rain-shower and large tub. Strangely, the toilet cubicle was housed in a separate compartment away from the bathroom. There’s also a coffee machine and a safe. The room is also whisper quiet, evident of great sound proofing. One feature missing is a in-room A/V system, surprised the hotel didn’t invested in one. The room features extensive mood lighting, which can be dimmed or brighten individually. Once I figured out the light function, it’s rather pleasant to use. The bed is very comfortable, feature silky smooth bed linens and face the windows. I had a great night sleep and it’s such a wonderfully elating feeling to wake up and draw back the curtains ( automated by the way ) and see the the entire Shanghai city below you.Overall, it’s a very design driven room and indeed very gorgeous looking. It ranks easily as one of best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. My few complains are the lighting is inadequate in the entrance foyer ( a bit dark and claustrophobic ) and the wetroom keep splashing water everywhere once the taps are on. Also, the toilet cubicle is quirky, with an accompany sink so shallow that I splashed water everytime I used it. The DVD player and iPod dock for some reasons are located at the bottom of the TV cabinet so one have to bend down to access it. Common AreasThe hotel is gorgeous throughout. Everything is cutting edge contemporary luxury and the owner obviously spared no expenses to decorate the place. Clever use of partitions, mirrors and other ingenious design elements transform the place literally into an oasis of calm and a haven of luxury and style. The restaurants follow the same trend, although the 91st floor 100 century avenue is way more flamboyant. The Living Room ( ie the hotel main lounge ) boast the best view of Bund in Shanghai ( provided weather is fine ) and also served drinks and snacks. An excellent place to relax and / or meet guest. Also, it appears that the hotel is the “it place” for well-to-do or new money Chinese to hang around, all of them eager to flaunt their wealth but unfortunately some of them lack the class and manners to go with it. It’s quite common during my stay to see businessman talking loudly into their mobiles or parents letting their toddlers scream their lungs off in the lobby and spoiling the tranquil atmosphere. I really like the food in this hotel and all the food served at all the food outlets are uniformly excellent. I had a quick afternoon snack at the Living Room and had the best tasting spring rolls I've ever eaten. The 100 century avenue restaurant is the highest restaurant in the world and have amazing 360 deg views of Shanghai. It served Japanese, Chinese and western with live cooking station. I had dinner there and food quality is excellent but very expensive. The dinning room serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner. I find the breakfast good but lack selection. Items like waffles, pancakes are conspicuously missing. Service at both restaurants are attentive. No complaints here. I also visited the swimming pool and small gym at the 85th floor. The pool looks really inviting and with surrounding cabanas it has a very resort feel. ServiceThis is one area where the hotel is lacking, as evident from the arrival experience. Also, there is inconsistent service level provided by the staff. Some are more friendly and helpful while a few acts so pretentiously that they are probably thinking we should be thankful to be staying at their hotel. In particularly, I find the front desk or the reception to be really inadequate, incompetent and snobbish due to my check-in and check-out experience. The need to wait for check-in was particularly unacceptable for a hotel of this class. Also, they appeared to be frequently confused while staring at their computer screen, not sure why.After my strong complaint on arrival, the Duty Managers did their best to recover from the service hiccups including switching to a more pleasant room with a much nicer view. I was also offered a complimentary limo ride to the airport by the Duty Manager as compensation for the “inconvenience” I experienced during check-in. This is a much appreciated gesture since the limo ride was very comfortable indeed in a brand new S-Class Mercedes. But even this, the frontdesk staff managed to be confused over this. Apparently, instructions weren’t passed down efficiently and I was first told the limo wasn’t arranged and they need to reconfirm if it’s complimentary. And strangely, the limo managed to appear at the last minute. Hmm…. English proficiency is another weakness. I could barely decipher their English and end up speaking mandarin to them most of the time. However, this is understandable in China where English wasn’t widely spoken by most people. Another service that isn’t up to task is the housekeeping which I find rather sloppy. I can easily spot traces of dirt and stains all throughout my room, on the taps or any shiny surfaces especially. Once again, hotels that positioned themselves as top-tier luxury hotels like Park Hyatt should deliver rooms which are spotless. Conclusion The Park Hyatt is designed and built to be a distinguished and unique luxury property. Certainly, throughout most of my stay and when things run smoothly, it does delivers a luxury experience befitting the Park Hyatt name and among the best I have experienced. Unfortunately, it does not have the necessary “software” to match the top notched hardware. The service staff, esp the frontdesk needs to improved. Perhaps my bad experience during arrival was an unforeseen and one-off hiccup but I’m judging this hotel based on it’s price and class. Despite the admirable attempts at service recovery by the hotel managers, it ultimately fails to deliver a perfect experience to merit my top rating. I’ll give it a 4 out of 5. Having said that, I will really like to return to the hotel again, perhaps when the weather is better and the view nicer and hopefully they work out all the service quirks by then. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"100 Century Avenue Rip-Off I recently took my family who were visiting Shanghai to the Park Hyatt for lunch at the 100 Century Avenue Restaurant. This was one of those very polluted Shanghai days with views largely obscured by a layer of thick haze around the city. We took this with grace. However, we were totally disappointed by the inattentive service from the restaurant's surly staff who lacked basic communicatioin skills and simple manners. When we asked for a glass of water, we were told that we had to order imported water at US$10 per serving. They could not pour a single glass of plain distilled water under any circumstances. In disbelief at this crude attempt to fleece as much as possible from every paying guest, I asked for the restaurant manager who also confirmed that it was indeed hotel policy not to serve dining guests with anything other than imported water. (By the way, local distilled water is safe, easily available and inexpensive. China also has a perfectly good natural sparkling water which does not need to be flown half-way around the world for you to drink.) Still in disbelief, I probed a little further and found out that hot water could be served at no charge. So, strange as this may seem in an international 5-star hotel, our party of 9 were given 9 pots of hot water along with 4 buckets of ice to mix our own drinking water in tea cups. By the way, the food at 100 Century Avenue Restaurant was fresh but unexceptional, and the menu lacked even the slightest hint of imagination. This is a very ordinary establishment who are far more interested in taking your money than offering you a pleasant and satisfying dining experience. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"A great day in Shanghai We recently spend 24 hours in Shanghai, and had the best time ever; woke up to a breathtaking view of the city from our room on the 83rd floor of the Park Hyatt Hotel. The PH is without any doubt one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in (location aside, as it is in Pudong)Our guide for the morning was a Texan called Spencer Dodington, from a local operator called Luxury Concierge China. Spencer took us on a visit of the French Concession and Bund. Though we are usually not all that much into tour guiding, Spencer impressed us by his passion and deep knowledge of the place. He even spoke Shanghainese. Lunch was in a quite restaurant in the Concession called Art Salon, in the French Concession. The place serves authentic local fare, at a reasonable prices. A very cool venue. In the afternoon, we went around the art district Moganshan Lu where we discovered some awesome Chinese contemporary artists, then moved on to Taikang Lu for some shopping. The evening was simply brilliant; we had an amazing dinner on the terrace at M on the Bund. M is apparently an institution in Shanghai, having been the first upscale foreign restaurant to have opened over ten years ago. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere superb. We finished off the day with drinks at Bar Rouge, down the road. We had been told that M1NT was the new place to be, but that Bar Rouge was picking up again, and hot these days. We tried our luck, and Bar Rouge was all in flames.What a day! We loved the city, its diversity, its energy, and can't wait to return. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Dining Room Restaurant and Living Room are amazing The view from Living Room at night is mesmerizing! Jin Mao tower looks like a spaceship about to take off.Love this place. Magic!The Dining Room Pantry Supper Buffet is amazing! The food is outstanding, the atmosphere, the wine list...wonderful, and the view is spectacular, with the clouds lowering over Pudong.Service is good and maitre d' hotel was charming. Decor is subtle and understated all through the hotel. Very tasteful.Front desk was sort of unhelpful though. At some point I received a memorized full speech that had no relation to what I had asked (simply asked where the restaurant was)...sort of comical...but disappointing at the Park Hyatt.Concierge was impeccably efficient.

park hyatt shanghai ,"high tea superb we had high tea at the park hyatt and it was fab. Lovely cakes and sandwiches in tranquil unhurried surroundings with an amazing view of the grand hyatt building, the pearl tower and the bund and pudong. It was lovely to sit and watch the sun setting. Money well spent "
park hyatt shanghai ,"The Best This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we have travelled extensively, usually staying in 5* hotels.The combination of the amazing views, the beautiful room and facilities made this is a real oasis in a hot, busy city. Not cheap, but still good value given the quality.The staff were very helpful. We had one problem which was dealt with efficiently - in fact dealt with so well - that it became a positive.On our return we are trying to see when we can pass through Shanghai again to stay at this hotel. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Sheer luxury I stayed here for my final night of a ten day trip to China, and it was just the perfect way to relax after all the travelling I'd done. The view of Jin Mao tower and the rest of the city from the room is stunning. I was lucky enough to be there on a sunny, clear day and watch the sun go down over the city. The bathroom is gorgeous with a big, deep bathtub, a ceiling installed &quot;rain&quot; shower, full-lengh mirrors everywhere, lovely scented Acca Kappa toileteries. The room has very chic, minimalist design, using lots of white and dark wood panelling. The various complimentary samples are kept in simple, laquered wood boxes. The swimming pool was large and not too crowded when I was there, as was the gym. The staff to guest ratio always seems quite high, giving a feeling of very personal, private service. Room service breakfast was very prompt and well presented. The Western Bar in the evening has live jazz/soul and an interesting choice of cocktails. It was a little quieter than I expected (I was there on a Saturday night, so I thought it might be busier.) Having been to the bar in Park Hyatt Tokyo, that place was a lot busier. Still, I cannot fault the hotel. Wallpaper magazine listed it as joing first place for best business hotel in the world. It's still a relatively new hotel and for a stunning glimpse of Shanghai in the 21st century it can't be beaten. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Sleeping in the Stars I have stayed here twice now on business and will keep coming back. Bedrooms are average size for China, but nice and sleek and modern. The views are amazing! Mine was looking down on the Bund and JinMao tower which used to be the tallest building in Shanghai, I believe. There was plenty of closet space, good options for lighting, free WiFi, coffee machine, big bathroom with separate toilet.The restaurant on the top floor is definitely worth a visit, but maybe just for a drink to appreciate the views. Service was impeccable.Although this hotel is on Pudong side it is easy to get taxis to take you to Puxi side, where there are more options for dining and drinking. If in Shanghai, do check out M1NT. It was recommended to me by the hotel concierge on my last visit. Its a fairly new restaurant/lounge with a weekend nightclub on the other side. On the 24th floor of a building just off the Bund. So the views there are also incredible. I could watch the lights sparkle on my hotel's building across the river while I ate my meal. Food was the best fusion food I have had yet in China, very unique and tasty. Service was excellent, and the entire place is styled with a modern Asian/urban feeling. Seating in lounge was very lush and private, also with the same amazing views. Then there is an open roof terrace to chill out in after your meal. Prices are a bit above average, but worth it for the experience and the views.Back to the hotel, I would highly recommend it.TIP: As other reviews have mentioned, some taxi drivers are not yet familiar with this hotel, so make sure you bring some of the hotel's cards with you when you come, so you can just hand it to the driver (if you don't speak Mandarin, that is!) "
park hyatt shanghai ,"21st Century China This fairly new hotel secures China's place with the rest of the developed world. Not to say that China is in any way lagging behind, but the style and classiness of this property is unsurpassed in China. Its scale is small yet grand at the same time. Dining choices are few but well-designed and devised. The simple buffet dinner in the lobby-level cafe, for example, had very carefully selected dishes, which complemented each other. Breakfast was a stylish affair, presided over by their friendly chef (and my fellow countryman).Rooms, although small for an hotel of this stature, are sleek, simple and comfortable, with phoenix-eye views from the top of tallest building in the city. The spa is spartan and the steam room was under repair, but the pool is of a generous size with a magnificent view of the Bund.Enjoy it whilst it reigns as the best hotel in China (and until the Peninsula opens across the river!) "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Enjoy the highlife in real style Even if it did not have the stunning views, this would be a wonderful hotel. Elegant and understated in true Park Hyatt style this was one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed in. Lofty bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable. They offer a huge amount of storage space, great lighting, nespresso coffee machine, free WiFi, separate hi tech toilet, fabulous large bathroom with a most impressive large rain shower – I think the most enjoyable shower ever! My room had a breathtaking view of the Jinmao Tower, the river and the Bund. I could have stayed forever!I had a great arrival, whisked up 87 floors in under 50 seconds, friendly efficient check-in, staff at every turn were attentive and courteous.The reception level offers a comfortable Lounge and Dinning Room facility but it is the restaurant and bar complex (the highest in the world) - 100 Century Avenue on the 91-93 floors which really excited. I sampled great service and food. It’s not cheap but so stylish and vibey - an ‘unique’ experience. In contrast, my experience in the Dining Room was actually rather mundane and ordinary.There is a lovely swimming pool and a small gym and Tai Chai lessons are provided free every morning.All in all a very special hotel which I enjoyed so much – at least until it came to check-out which was strangely impersonal, particularly given all the attention I received during my stay. There was no thanks or interest shown and I was charged for coffee delivered to the bedroom despite the fact it was advertised as being complimentary. Despite this I would not hesitate to return and strongly recommend it. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Excellent new hotel just that most taxi drivers don't know of it. Hotel just opened recently and service is very good overall with a 'butler' on each floor. Rooms are great, beautifully (trendy/modern) designed, and large, and come equipped with a Nespresso coffee/espresso machine. Since the hotel is located near the top of the tallest building in China, views are great also. The rooms are the best part of the hotel. Pool is very nice and large also. Had trouble with the internet and the staff was not that helpful/knowledgeable about that. Not a lot of restaurant choices, however. Location is in the new financial district, but that is on the less desireable side of the river. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"A top rate hotel experience A beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms in the tallest building in China. If the air was clear, the view would be fantastic. The service is wonderful, all of the amenities are top drawer. Attention has been paid to the smallest detail.The only negative of this hotel is it's location. While convenient to business offices in the Pudong, it is inconvenient for any of the tourist sites. "
park hyatt shanghai ,Exceeded every expectaion..the finest hotel in Asia We went to Shanghai during a vacation touring Asia. We were booked originally in another 5 star hotel in Shanghai that was.... how does one say it nicely...tired in ambience with an uncaring staff. Shanghai in a simple way is divided like NYC is..with a river separting Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Park Hyatt is in the Manhattan section of Shanghai. The other hotel we originally booked in was in Brooklyn. We decided to check out other hotels and stumbled on the Park Hyatt by accident and we were totally blown away. We only stay in 5 star hotels and out of all of them in the world the Park Hyatt was the best hotel..ever..and rivals the Cipriani in Venice and and Villa D'Este on Lake Como. You have to embrace modern decor as the hotel is done in a very casual Calvin Klein like fashion with the elegance of Armanis style thrown in. The staffs impeccable manners combined with the service from both the concierge and the regular day to day staff and the View from any direction can not be topped. The spa boasts the highest pool in the world and is very calming and serene with a staff that caters to your every whim. If you are a &quot;foodie&quot;...the restaurant on the top floor was out of this world in all ways. The Park Hyatt is a wonderful home to stay in while in Shanghai and if you enjoy beyond superior service...the Park Hyatt should be your choice without any hesitation. The Park Hyatt sets a standart of excellence that is going to be hard to be beat!!PS: Make sure ANYWHERE you choose to go in China is written down in Chinese and English as most of the taxi drivers do not speak a word of English and especially carry the Hotels business card with you so the drivers do no take you to the wrong Hyatt. 
park hyatt shanghai ,"Best View Ever This is my favourite Hyatt. I stayed at the Hyatt on the Bund for 2 nights and then Park Hyatt Shanghai for another 2 nights. The room is fantastic! -- very new, very avant garde. There were 2 TVs in the room, one in the bedroom and the other at the vanity area. The rain shower is the biggest that I've ever seen,,,,probably measures 30cm by 20cm, big enough for 2 persons to stand under it. The bathtub is also big enough for 2 persons. The toliet has a motion sensor...when you walk near it, the toilet bowl cover lifts by itself. It also has the functions that a typical Japanese toilet bowl has. The room also comes with an expresso machine. Other than the room itself, the view is gorgeous. We were given a room on the 79th floor, facing the Bund. (The hotel is on the 79th to 87th floor, I think). The bed faces the full length window and hence whilst lying on the bed, you can have a bird's eye view. Mind you, pple actually queue to go up to the top of SWFC to enjoy the view. You won't have to do that if you are staying at Park Hyatt. One thing to note though is that the security is very tight. Before you can enter the building, your bags need to go through a scanner and you have to go through a metal detector. Service wise, I wouldn't say the hotel staff are very warm and friendly. They are polite though...and no complaints about their service...just that they do not give you a very warm feeling. Oh ya, and if you have time, go to the pool and spa area, Lovely day beds...and nice pool and hot jacuzzi. The pool butlers will prepare your daybed and provide you with ipod.Overall it was a great stay and I will definitely stay here again the next time I go to Shanghai. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Should be fabulous in every respect; wasn't I give this hotel a 4 (above average), but for a Park Hyatt property, this should be a great disappointment. A Park Hyatt should receive Excellent remarks in all ways -- and this property does not.I booked my room before the hotel opened -- and subsequently had great difficulty communicating with both the hotel and hotel concierge (multiple messages were not returned despite having confirmed the e-mail addresses with Park Hyatt corporate).On arrival, my preferred room type was not available -- though I had requested it months in advance, reconfirming the request on multiple occasions including just a week prior to arrival. (The requested room type had not been promised to me, but the request was made quite early and reconfirmed, so it was disappointing.)The hotel itself is spectacular in several regards: the 91st floor lobby lounge is wonderfully comfortable, plush and discreet. The room and public area materials are top-rate with superb construction. The amenities were terrific: high-quality and plentiful. WiFi was -- as it ought to be -- free, and there were many international electric outlets placed throughout the room.The pool is beautiful and the locker room facilities gorgeous -- though young children were allowed to play in the Jacuzzi, unfortunately. I am told this is against spa policy, so it may be corrected.The room was quiet and wonderfully laid out with stunning furnishings and the bathroom beautiful.Service, which should be a hallmark of any Park Hyatt, was mixed: the staff-to-guest ratio was stunning (in a positive way), but the man- and woman-power was not well deployed. The large number of staff did not appear well choreographed (for instance, it once took three ever-helpful staff members to direct us to the wrong elevator bank to our rooms; you must, oddly, return to the main lobby floor from your room floor before exiting the building). We did not receive turn-down service, despite requesting it specifically (though that should not be necessary).These criticisms might be forgiven as growing pains, though the booking rates are by no means 'introductory.'Note that since the hotel is new, taxi drivers do not yet know where it is (even those with some idea confuse it with the next-door Grand Hyatt). Not once were we able to get a taxi to get us into the hotel's private driveway -- despite hotel direction-cards written in Chinese (with maps).Check-in and check-out were time-consuming and laborious (with a line for check-out), involving several (very polite and earnest) staff members and much copying of documents. Possibly this is a function of mainland China regulations, not the hotel -- but in any event it is not up to expectations.I rate this hotel a 4 (above average) on this site primarily due to the quality of the facilities -- though in terms of my specific experience (which I hope would not be typical for future visitors), I would have given it a 2. It should be a 5 (excellent). "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Nicest urban Hotel in the World Most Luxurious and Modern Hotel that exists in any City. It just opened in 2008 so everything is brand new while the staff is well trained to cater to all your wishes. The overall feeling is incredible, from the elaborate entrance on the ground floor to the incredible views from the Lobby that is 87 stories in the air. The sleek Modern style of the Hotel is very tastefully done with smart detailing all over. The rooms continue to impress as they include technology induced toilet seats (that are a pleasure to use), rain like shower heads that drop water from the 12' ceilings, and as assumed a very comfortable bed that of course has breathtaking views. And while you are staying there you simply have to go take a swim in the enormous infinity pool and hot tub on the 89th floor. The multiple restaurants that are all on the 91st floor are another marvel with their great wine selection, fine food, and amazing setting. You can also venture up to the bar on the 92nd floor.The downside is obviously the cost for all this luxury. Depending on the exchange rate and your currency, staying their can add up from the hotel room (I paid $375, which was well worth it) to the pricey food and amenities.Overall I had a wonderful experience that I will continue to rave about and will definitely be staying there again whenever I make it back to Shanghai. If one can afford it or feels like splurging on a nice hotel (as I did), I would highly recommend the Park Hyatt. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Fabulous Hotel I stayed at the PH Shanghai for a week, yes, I agree there were one or two small teething problems, but overall this is a stunning hotel. The new restaurant and bar has just opened and are excellent. The rooms are spacious and well thought out. The service was very attentive and quick.Whilst not as exciting as the PH Tokyo, probably the best in Shanghai right now. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Excellent Service and a Great Experience Given the number of questionable reviews about this new property, I was initially apprehensive about booking my stay here. However, I must admit that my stay overall was a very positive one and I highly recommend others to consider this property. I agree with some of the other reviews that this property is not the easiest to locate. Along with Park Hyatt’s subtle design, this property is not only that, but its also hard to find as the entrance is not easy to find by any of the taxi drivers. Upon arrival, well dressed staff welcomed me to the hotel and instructed me to check in on the 91rst floor. Here are my thoughts about this property.Hotel Room: As a Diamond Member of Hyatt’s Goldpassport Program, I was upgraded to a Park Deluxe King Room. The room was one of the largest that I’ve seen in Shanghai. Appropriately, the staff did not refer to it as a suite. The room was equipped with a 37 inch flat screen, dvd player, huge bath with separate room with toilet. The toilet was hi-tech with an infra-red sensor that raises the toilet seat upon entry into the room. The ceiling mounted shower/bath area is separated from the sink/closet. Restaurant and Room Service: I tried the room service which has a mixed selection of western and asian entrees. My order was delivered within 20 minutes and was tasty. Breakfast was served in their living room lounge and the main dining area. I understand that another restaurant and jazz lounge is under construction but not open during my stay.Spa and Health Club: I found the health club to be very nicely equipped, but a bit cramped and in need of additional cardio equipment. The facilities at both the Grand Hyatt Jin Mao and Hyatt on the Bund are superior to this property. Fortunately, I was the only person working out during the three times that I visited the health club, so I was fine. As for the spa treatment, I had a good visit, but enjoyed the spa treatment at the Hyatt on the Bund much better. The facility at the Park Hyatt is beautiful especially with the pool and tub area. However, I found the treatment room to be a bit small. The staff were great hosts and tried to address my needs throughout the spa visit. Overall, this is a very well designed and exclusive hotel. The staff is well trained, friendly and accommodating. I enjoyed my two stay here and would sign-up for another stay when I return to Shanghai in the Spring. "
park hyatt shanghai ,"Bad service First off - I did not stay in this hotel. But I need to write a review here to warn unwary travellers of visiting this place.We visited just this past weekend on November 7th, 2008. A small group of friends arrived for drinks to check out the spectacular view (fyi: it's lights out in SH by 10:30 pm so the view wasn't as spectacular as we'd hoped) since the hotel lobby is perched on the 78th floor of the SH Financial Centre.We were greeted by unhelpful staff at the lounge who informed us that non-hotel guests must pay RMB 100 just to enter the lounge or the bar - I was shocked, I couldn't believe a hotel of this calibre would charge people RMB 100 just to sit there! Anyhow, we were told the bar was full so we opted for the lounge. The only tables available were for 4 but as the seats were just armchairs and we were a group of 5, we asked if they could move one of the empty chairs so that we could sit together. The staff FLAT OUT REFUSED. They simply said they could not move the furniture. Again, I was stunned.Then one of my friends went to the bar to enquire about capacity - this time she spoke in English and we were immediately given a table. Nonetheless, we were still charged RMB 100 per head entry fee, on top of that they did not clean and set the table before they seated us, and we ordered a bottle of sparkling wine which the staff proceeded to fill our glasses with. The girl literally filled our glasses just 2 cm from the brim of the glass and each time someone took a sip she would refill it. It felt like they were rushing us to leave even though there wasn't a line to enter.Wait, it gets worse! After drinks we wandered around the lobby a bit to admire the decor and the whole time we were followed, questioned and even stopped from taking photos by hotel security. It felt more like a high-security prison than a high-end international hotel!I hope the management of the Park Hyatt Shanghai sees this message. We all think you really need to work on your ground staff who are a direct portrayal of your customer service values. As it stands, I've gone from a potential guest of your hotel to someone who would recommend against it. "
park hyatt shanghai ,Room is quite big compared to Grand Hyatt Shanghai I stayed in Park Hyatt Shanghai for 2 nights from 10-Oct-2008 to 12-Oct-2008.I booked a King-sized bedroom and I would say the room is definitely bigger than the same size room in Grand Hyatt Shanghai (which is just opposite of Park Hyatt Shanghai).The hotel entrance is still quite unknown for most taxi drivers and you may need to prepare for some misunderstanding.The hotel lobby is nicely decorated but relatively small compared to other 5-star hotels in Shanghai.Service is not bad imaging this hotel has been opened for less than 2 months. 
park hyatt shanghai ,"Destined for greatness - but with inevitable teething troubles My wife and I stayed at the Park Hyatt at the very end of September, a matter of days after the hotel had opened and, we subsequently learned, while it was still officially in pre-opening mode. It was inevitable, therefore, that the hotel would show some teething problems and this certainly held true.The hotel occupies the top few floors of the brand new Shanghai World Financial Centre - an awesome building that looks like a giant bottle opener and which is located next door to the city’s second most imposing building, the Jin Mao - which, curiously, happens to be the home of the Grand Hyatt. Nowhere else in the world can a chain have two flagship properties so close to one another.The Park Hyatt is stylish, understated and ever so slightly mysterious. The reception, for example, is on a level above that of the rooms themselves and the private elevator which serves the room floors is quite separate from that used to enter the property. The place is also guarded like Fort Knox, which may simply have been because it was not yet officially open, or because the SWFC building is presently attracting vast numbers of visitors, few of whom would be welcome in the hotel.Check-in is slick and efficient, but some reception staff appear inexperienced or just new and nervous - and many do not speak fluent English. Communication from the pre-arrival reservations staff was extremely proactive (e.g. an e-mail to acknowledge that I was a Hyatt platinum card holder and asking whether there was anything special I needed) but the communication between this office and the reception staff seemed to be non-existent, as some of these requests then failed to materialise.Rooms are extremely stylish and show off typical Park Hyatt understated luxury, with lovely textures and shades of beige and brown. The large beds are equipped with top quality linen. Our “suite” was however simply an oversized room. Whilst I was upgraded into it, so could not complain, I commented to the duty manager that it would have come as a huge disappointment, had I actually been expecting a suite. One advantage of the suites, however, is that they have a fantastic window-side bath, which the regular rooms do not. They also feature a separate lavatory, off a completely different part of the room - and equipped with a lavatory that comes from the set of a sci-fi movie, with a motion-activated lid that rises as you approach (!) We were told that the bathroom benefited from under-floor heating but this seemed not to be functioning at the time we visited.Housekeeping proved to be a bit hit and miss, which we attributed to the fact that the hotel had just opened. One day our room was not made up until the evening, while on another the turn-down service failed to materialise later in the day.Breakfast was not a five-star experience, which we suspect may also be a teething issue. On one day we were declined poached eggs because the duty chef did not know how to make them (!) while some of the a-la-carte offerings seemed to have come off a hotplate.The hotel’s bar is cozy and enjoys spectacular cityscape views, although we noted that the seats at the window tables are not high enough for these views to be experienced without standing up - a simple design oversight which we feel sure will be corrected in due course. Finally, we were disappointed to find that the “100 Century Avenue” entertainment complex that sits directly above the hotel had not yet opened at the time of our stay. Without it, the hotel was left with just one restaurant and a relatively small bar, which seemed modest for a property of this quality.Overall, I am sure that the Park Hyatt is destined to become one of Shanghai’s most exclusive hotel destinations and will be fully deserving of a 5-point TripAdvisor score. At the moment, however, I only feel able to award it 4 (and in some respects bordering on 3). "

peace hotel ,"An institution! After reading some of the reviews and seeing some pictures, I have to admit it is not the best maintained hotel in the world. But it doesnt matter as this hotel has always been an historical institution and the location is fab,so close to the Bund!The staff was very kind and helpful when I went (New Year 2000-2001), I was 15 back then and had an amazing experience in Shanghai. i came back 5 years later I couldnt recognize anything cause it changes so fast! "
peace hotel ,"Great historical hotel great location The Shanghai Peace Hotel has a very long history, and is located right on the Bund in Shanghai. It has a great classic environment, and the service is great as well. We stayed there for only one night, and compared to other five star hotels, it is not too expensive.From our window, we could see the bund, and the skyline in Pu Dong. The bar downstairs is very nice as well. "
peace hotel ,"One of the Best Hotels in the World!! I spent the first night in China at the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. I had requested it because of it's history. I was not disappointed. I arrived at about 9PM, so it was dark and I was tired after a long flight from Vancouver and Beijing. I awoke the next morning after a short sleep to a beautiful sunny day. I went to the Phoenix and Dragon room on the ninth floor for breakfast. The windows were opened as it was a warm day. I sat by the window overlooking the Huang Pu and Pudong. It was like a fantasy come true. As I looked out the window, my first visual impressions of China were the true China. I will never forget it. The hotel and staff were excellent. The location could not have been better. I love the Peace Hotel, or Heping Fandian, in Chinese. This is a must. "
peace hotel ,"The place to stay in Shanghai The Peace hotel delivers on history and comfort.It was a pleasure staying at this hotel.The hotel is an authentic art deco wonder.We stayed here for a week on the seventh floor and enjoyed every minute. The hotel is actually two towers with rooms in the tower farthest from the Bund.When you enter off Nan Jing road, turn to your right and you will find the way to the elevators that lead to the restaurants and roof top bar. One hidden staircase takes you to the pastry shop, which serves pastries, tea, coffee and diet cokes. Another staircase will take you to a small bookstore and the library area.The bar is best visited at night. There is a gorgeous view of the Bund all lit up at night. Plus after a month in China I found they served club house sandwiches with potato chips. Heaven and not overly expensive. The rooms on the seventh floor were spacious, well laid out with a separate dressing room(included a in room safe) and a huge bathroom, with a soaker tub and a separate shower. The location couldn’t have been better, out the door and turn left your on Nan Jing road. Cross the street to the Bund and there is a long walk way that you can stroll on either day or night. If you like glass look for the Lalique statues outside the restaurants, there right there and the Peace Grill has Lalique glass everywhere. "
peace hotel ,"Tourist trap The hotel might have gotten its 'good' rep. 10 years ago, but it seems that they haven't done anything with it since. Rooms were big. Beds rock hard.worn out- would be my description. After 4 nights we changhed hotel to Ramada a bit more central on Nanjing lu. Same price but much nicer. "
peace hotel ,"Avoid This Hotel!!! We are from Scotland, and are in Shanghai during the holiday period visiting close Chinese friends. On an evening out, we planned to meet our guests in the bar at the Peace Hotel on The Bund. We arrived first, so we waited in the bar. Our guests then phoned us to say they were arriving, so one of us went outside, met them and brought them into the bar.We asked what they would liked to drink and placed our order. When we were part-way through our drinks, a waitress come over to our table and started talking to our guests, ignoring us. We waived her away. She then opened the menu and started to talk to our guests again, pointing to the cover charge. We then said, quite firmly, that &quot;these are our guests&quot;. The waitress took no notice. She pointed out the service charge to one of our guests. Only once we had said a third time &quot;Yes, we know about the cover charge, it is okay,&quot; did the waitress then leave.We complained to the management before we left, and we are not prepared to suffer such a serious loss of face in front of our important guests. One of us is a senior citizen with many grey hairs and though a working professional person, could be retired if she chose; this was doubly disrespectful against her.One of the reasons we are both so offended is that we have both travelled to Shanghai many times before, and have been treated extremely well, courteously and professionally in other establishments. This contrasts greatly with the treatment we received at The Peace Hotel.The Peace Hotel is unclean, it smells as if it is rotting, the staff are rude. I am amazed that famous dignatories have ever stayed here recently. They have been very ill-advised. What a poor image of China to present to the world!I would urge anyone not to stay in this Hotel, which is barely a shadow of its glory days. Five stars? I would not give it one. "
peace hotel ,"Peace Hotel - Its not that bad I have stayed at the Peace Hotel many times in the last 10 years and can conclude that it is a bit tired and could be cleaner, however, during my extensive travels in China i have stayed in much worse, many in and around Shanghai and I hope these objective points about the Peace hotel will help you:The view is one of the best in Shanghai, particularly from the restaurant though there are many rooms where there is no view at all. The position is also excellent. The food in the restaurant is reasonably priced Chinese cuisine and the menu is translated into English, the breakfast is predominanntly Chinese and will not suit all tastes. The Peace is one of the oldest hotels in China and the fittings and architecture are exquisite, the history of the place is phenominal. The Peace was built in the early 1900's and i suspect it has not been re-fitted since the 60's. The hotel could be cleaner and during my various visits i have had many rooms varying in cleanliness. If you want ultra modern hotel accomodation with fluent English speaking staff and a resaurant offering full Western cuisine then the Peace is not for you. Either way I do not think as a tourist you would want to stay at the Peace for more than a couple of nights. "
peace hotel ,"Go for the history We spent our last night in Shanghai at the Peace Hotel in May. We had previously stayed at the Portman Ritz, the Pudong Shangri-La, and the Grand Hyatt. We knew the Peace Hotel wasn't in the same class, but really wanted one night at this historical hotel. And for one or two nights, I think it's worth a stay. We were in a suite, with very high ceilings and a view out across the river to Pudong. In the morning you could see groups of people practicing Tai Chi in the park along the Bund. The room's furnishings were old-fashioned and a bit worn. You felt as though you'd stumbled into one of those old 1940's movies when you walked through the room. Beds were comfortable, and the bathroom, while not luxurious, was acceptable - hair dryer, soaps, bottled water were all provided. The location is both a plus and a minus. Traffic noise is pretty high all the time, because you're at the end of Nanjing Road right at the Bund. But the view from the rooftop bar/restaurant is spectacular at night, and it's a quick walk over to the Bund, to catch a riverboat cruise, or to walk down to Najing shopping.The breakfast/brunch was included in our hotel price. It doesn't begin to compare to the lavish breakfast spreads at the Ritz or the Grand Hyatt, but you can find enough cheeses, fruits, and breads to slake your appetite until you have lunch. "
peace hotel ,"It all depends on what room you get Stayed at the Peace Hotel in the last leg of an all inclusive tour. There are so many types of rooms that it's a real crap shoot what you'll get on a tour.My room was fabulous; huge, old but well cared for, wonderfully remodelled bathroom, walk in closet. Two of my friends rooms were smaller, but nice.Another friend got a 2 room &quot;suite&quot; that was a nightmare. The sitting room was tiny but okay. The bedroom was miniscule with no dresser, ancient peeling walpaper, and stained bedskirts. I think if you get one of the &quot;outside&quot; rooms you're better off. The bad room in our group faced the smallest of the interior light-wells. The others were on the &quot;back&quot; of the building (so no views), but the rooms were nice enough that we didn't care. "
peace hotel ,"If you like old-style grand hotels - go for it! Some people prefer to stay in hotels offering the latest in design, style or other type of &quot;sophistication&quot; or &quot;luxury&quot;. If you are one of them - don't choose the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. However, if you love old Grand Hotels with a rich history and atmosphere then go for it. Because then you will not mind if the air condition is not cooling the room down to below zero, if the room is a bit noisy (because the hotel is on one of the busies corners of central Shanghai and the windows are not of the double sound-proof type). On the contrary, you will appreciate the little signs of former glamour, the excellent location just off the bund, the beautiful restaurants with their unmatched views of the river and Pudong and the wonderful roof terrace. If you are nice to the staff, they will be nice to you as well. If your only reason for travelling is the best value for money (and value being measured in room amenities and &quot;luxury&quot; gimmicks) then you should choose another hotel. But you will miss the opportunity of experiencing a part of Shanghai's amazing history. "
peace hotel ,"Horribly bad This hotel is terribly bad. The room is dirty and smelly, clerks are rude, the food is lousy, I would only willing to give 1/2 a star!! Stay away from this hotel. "
peace hotel ,Disgustingly Dirty The Peace Hotel is one of the dirtiest I've stayed in anywhere in the world. The price is high and the cheapest hostel in any city is cleaner. The service is non-existent and some floors are littered with dirt and debris. The place smells bad and the rooms are musty. Give it a miss. 
peace hotel ,Riding on its historic reputation This hotel may be historic and in a great location but it is hardly enjoyable. I booked my room on the hotel web site which was a pretty good deal. My room was dark and dingy. I had no water pressure and had to shower in the sink. When I called for room service they didn't understand me and so they hung up. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. 
peace hotel ,"Five Stars of Horror I stayed with my wife along with our families for a trip to China. We decided to stay at the Peace because of its reasonable price and its great location along Nanjing Road, Shanghai's famous shopping district. I will first start off with the only positive for this hotel. The location can't be beat in terms of its vicinity to Nanjing Road and also the Bund River, etc. Now I understand that the Peace Hotel is a famous historical landmark built in 1929 with its architecture carefully preserved. However, under no circumstances can I recommend anyone to stay in this hotel unless it was a total emergency. When you first enter the hotel, its smells like rotting wood. The carpets are disgustingly worn and the hotel is in complete need of remodeling. This place looked like something out of a horror movie. Things get worse when you enter the rooms. We had four rooms and all of them had serious mildew and mold issues in the bathrooms (see pictures attached) that were disgusting and the carpets continued to be dirty and worn down. The showers were designed in such a poor way that if you took a shower, water would not drain properly and ended up flooding the entire bathroom. (Some advice: Bring flop flops for the shower.) We stayed on the 2nd floor of the South Tower (where the restaurants were-We didn't eat there for obvious reasons). If you unfortunately do need to stay there, pick a room higher up as you can hear the traffic and horns honking at all times during the day.I simply do not comprehend how this hotel has a 5 star rating. To add insult to injury, the hotel staff was also below average and many had poor Enlgish compared to other Chinese hotels I have stayed at.This is about a 1.5 star hotel at best and I am being kind. This might have been the dirtiest hotel/motel I have stayed at (Hotel 6, Days Inn, etc. included)I did speak to the Concierge and they did say the hotel will be shut down sometime in 2007 for a full remodel. Don't stay there till then!Some general advice: -When shopping for hotels in China, the best rule of thumb is to stick with foreign run hotel chains (Hyatt, Marriott, Novotel, Sofitel, etc) as Chinese run hotels have a tendency to have inflated star ratings (like the Peace.) and not be as well kept.-Unless you are at a department store or some type of chain store, most items can be bargained for (especially street vendors). If you are paying more than 50% of their first offer or the listed price, you are probably overpaying (Try to get them down to 25-40% of their first offer)-Stick with cabs with meters. Cabs are ridiculously cheap.-Pedestrians do not have the right on way! Watch out when crossing the street! "
peace hotel ,"Unbelievable Bad I stayed here for a week in September 2006 in the north wing, supposedly the more 'upmarket'. This hotel was about a 1 star hotel. standard room was tiny, dirty, the aircon didnt work properly, the wiring was hanging out of the wall, the room had one tiny window which overlooked a service shaft. The room was dark. Room service appalling. food overpriced and mis-represented. eg stewed peaches were 3 peache halves straight from the can. Telephone was unreliable due to poor wiring. Business center vastly overpriced with terible service. Porters surly. A plague of umbrella sellers, pen sellers, watch sellers cluster around the front door and are not chased away by hotel staff as one would expect at a reasonable hotel. I speak Chinese and had 4 fights with the reception about various aspects of the room, the service and so on. DO NOT stay here; visit the jazz bar for a drink, take photos of the building, have food across the road in peace hotel annexe (south) but do not support this smelly, dark, overpriced rip-off! (only good aspect is location - right on the Bund and Nanjing rd) "
peace hotel ,"Good and Bad There are positive and negative things to say about the Peace Hotel. If you're looking for a decent place to stay in a great location, this is the place. If you want luxury, you need to go elsewhere.Positives: LOCATION. Right on the Bund and at the beginning of Shanghai's main shopping street, the Peace Hotel has the best location in the city. Otherwise, I had a standard room and while the bathroom was old and tired, the room was very spacious. I needed an extra bed in the hotel room, and even with the bed there was plenty of space in the room.Negatives: The bathroom was terrible. Staff were generally short of rude, but nowhere near helpful. I asked several times for recommendations on where to get tailored suits in Shanghai, and each time the concierge directed me to the wrong place. Also, on check in I went to the main building (North) and staff informed me that I had no booking even though I had pre-paid through Expedia. The problem was that I had booked in the South Tower. Apparently the same hotel is on different booking systems. Word of advice for Shanghai as well: when taking taxis, NEVER take the red taxis. They are run by an unethical company and will rip you off. Stay with the green cabs. "
peace hotel ,"Fantastic Peace There are too many things to say about the Peace Hotel, but i must say that the location is fantastic located at the bund and on Nanjing road. It is only about a 5-10minute walk to the major shopping on Nanjing road, with all its bright neon lights, was like a mini Vegas.The hotel's ambience is relaxing and friendly, they have a great jazz band that play all the great oldies. The hotel room was more like an apartment it was that huge, and the bathroom was more a something you would see in a suite.No complaints, and one of the restuarants has the best chocolate tarts i've ever tasted. TO DIE FOR!!!If going back, i would never have to second guess as to where to stay, unless of cause booked out as is so POPULAR!! "
peace hotel ,"Peace of.... After pre-booking this hotel through Amex Travel, the front desk staff refused to honour the standard corporate rate for my company and demanded I pay about 40% more. After about 10 phone calls to various managers and about 40 minutes later, the unfriendly front desk staff finally relented to giving me the pre-negotiated rate. My reward for my perceived stubbornness was a dingy room with damp peeling wallpaper, yellowing curtains, a TV that didnt work, and a lovely view across a dark alley to an adjoining brick wall. I must say I was warned by other posters here about the staff and hotel facilities but thought perhaps there might have been a bit of exaggeration happening here. Next time I'll pay $10 more and try somewhere a little higher on the Tripadvisor popularity index. "
peace hotel ,"Good location This landmark hotel is in a great location, but it is a historic hotel and things (like air conditioning) do not always work as anticipated. Stayed with a large group in standard rooms with the hardest beds I have ever been on in my life. Service was good, overall cleanliness of the hotel good. Staff were pleasant, not overly friendly but helpful if you asked for something. I think a good value for the money. Property has some nice restoration work and modern upgrades have been tastefully incorporated. "
peace hotel ,"Peace Hotel not as bad as anticipated I had always wanted to stay at the Peace Hotel, but after reading the reviews here I was reluctant. It was much better than I had anticipated.I found the the front desk, bell hops, and concierge all to be very professional and friendly.I did not eat in any of the restaurants so I cannot comment.Definitely DO NOT waste your money on the jazz band. It was beyond terrible, totally off key and a ripoff. The hostess in the jazz bar was rude and obnoxious.The rooftop bar is worth the price of a drink; really fantastic view.My room was very small, but it was the least expensive available in the main building.The bathroom was modern and clean, and the room was nothing great, but not bad for the price I paid. There was distant construction going on, but not enough noise to bother me.All in all, it was not bad. One night is enough to experience the old-world atmosphere. "
peace hotel ,"Stay away! They try to say it is a 5* hotel- NO WAY. I had to upgrade my room bec the SURPIOR room I ordered was garbage with view to the yard. The resturant is a 2* hotel resturant, terrible service and I was charged for food I didn't get. No more in Peace hotel. For 190US$ you can a much better hotel "
peace hotel ,"Too many locals I have just spent two weeks as a tour leader in China. Shanghai was our last city and I had requested of the tour company that we stay at the Peace Hotel. My last stay there was wonderful. This time the rooms were like saunas as there is no AC and we had to ask for fans. Also, the dining room staff are slow and sometimes downright rude. My main beef was the local country people using the front steps as a pick up place for their tours around the city. If the hotel does not do something soon about this idiocy, they will lose their overseas customers. Trying to push through a seetheing mass of yelling people is not pleasant.On the good side, the hotel is close to everything and the house-keeping staff are always obliging. PS. Never stay in Zhouzhuang overnight. They still have not learnt how to set tables for breakfast.Cartam "
peace hotel ,"The checkin was a warning The check in should have warned us, the staff were rude and abrasive and the smell of sewage at the desk was hardly five star. On first entering the room looked impressive but the furnishings and fittings looked tired and when the bath was drawn the water was yellow. Our bed was like sleeping on old ornate doors and the TV was so far away it was not worth having on. Breakfast was a very basic affair the bacon and scrambled eggs were greasy and the toaster was useless with staff hard to attract. A simple request for milk to be delivered to our room was met with a total lack of communication. Waiting for room service meals was a drawn out affair and the end result was dodgy anyway. The bar on the mezzanine level had the smell of the nearby toilets wafting in and the combined smell of sewage and cooking was present whilst waiting for the lifts on the upper levels. Our upgraded room looked across to a building site were work was going on at all hours of the night. The staff were noisy in the hallways and constantly banging the doors to the service areas. One of our many surprises was coming back to our room on the day the temperature was 3°C to find the heating turned off. Whilst exploring the hall that runs from the foyer to the Bund entrance we noticed the doors appeared to be closed off we found out why when about halfway down the hall we were driven back by the stench of raw sewage. The only thing missing was Basil - five star no, Fawlty Towers yes! "
peace hotel ,"No Manners I recently stayed in the Peace Hotel in Shanghai with my parents, and while the room was charming, the staff was not. We stayed in one of the nice suites facing the river and the room itself was o.k., though the carpeting and furniture were a little old and holey. The front desk staff, however, were rude and not the least bit helpful. I live in China so I am accustomed to Chinese culture, and this was not some kind of cultural difference, they were just RUDE. If you've never been to China, and think you'll need help finding restaurants, places of interest, etc., don't stay here. You'll be lucky if the front desk staff acknowledge your presence let alone provide any information. "
peace hotel ,"Old World Charm I had the pleasure of visiting Shanghai for business in February and spent my free time, 3 nights, at the Peace Hotel. I used Trip Advisor for guidance and got what I expected, old world charm in a very old and some what dated hotel which for me only added to the pleasure of my trip.Excellent location on The Bund, close to shopping and the Yu Yuan Gardens and the Old Town. I would happily stay there again. "
peace hotel ,"never again I stayed at the Peace Hotel in May 2005. It was an experience I do not wish to repeat. The room was smelly, the furniture broken and glued together with some sort of superglue and the upholstery was so dirty the I did not dare to sit on the chairs without putting a clean towel onto the seat! My reservation was for a non-smoking room - that apparently means the after you arrive in your room housekeeping knocks on your door to take away the ash trays! The window did not close properly - that of course did not stop the rain entering the room through the 1 inch gap at the window. The whole window side was not damp (it rained for a few days) it was soaking wet. On top of it this hotel was as expensive as the Sheraton and the Marriot in Hong Qiau - the problem was that both hotels where booked out during my first night due to trade fairs. "
peace hotel ,"Well past its Sell-by date Having recently spent a night at the Peace Palace hotel, a world famous hotel with a long and colourful history, I was extremely disappointed with the cleanliness, service and facilities. The hotel, and particularly the rooms, are dowdy and grubby. In fact the whole hotel could do with a thoroughly good spring clean. The attitude of the staff leaves much to be desired, and one gets the feeling that they are doing you a favour simply talking to you.The well known “Jazz Bar” is nothing but a rip-off. Even as a hotel guest, you are expected to pay for the privilege of buying drinks in there, and listening to a Geriatric Band that is way past its Sell-by-Date. The band sound as though they are on an old wind up record player whose spring is broken, and they certainly have no ‘joie de vivre’ left. The Peace Palace hotel is living off its past reputation, and in this day and age, should certainly not be classed as a 5 Star hotel.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. "
peace hotel ,"Historic older Peace Hotel Spent three nights at the historic Peace hotel, wow what a place, all is good, but i only stayed in the least expensive room, so not quite the Hilton, but this hotel has been around for some time and is very pretty inside, service is great. Its based a short walk from the river at the end of the main shopping street. loved it, try it . "
peace hotel ,"Peace Hotel - excellent stay and great location I was truly worried about our stay at the Peace, reading all the reviews below. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find our room was HUGE (as big as one I had at the Island Shangri-la, admittedly in Hong Kong). The room was clean and the amenities provided (toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers etc) on a par with and even better than some of the luxury hotels. We stayed as part of a package, so weren't even accorded one of the better rooms (we had a rubbish view). Staff were pleasant and I found the breakfast of good quality. Our friends' room had a slight smell but personally I always burn a lavender candle and can't see what the problem is.The location is perfect - you are 3 mins from Bar Rouge at Bund 8 and the only issue is the hawkers/beggars that besiege you the moment you step outside, but that's hardly Peace's fault.In short - we had a great stay and would stay there again. As for a Pudong hotel - well Shanghai traffic is awful and personally I prefer to be on the Bund side. Obviously if you're there for business then Pudong may suit better, but the Peace cannot be beaten. "
peace hotel ,"Peace Hotel Was Just Fine Spent two nights at the Peace Hotel. I had a room facing Nanjing Road, on the 5th floor. And yeah...It's a noisy street (but not late at night). I suppose if you had your windows open, it would bother, even on the 5th floor. But it's so muggy so often, I can't imagine why you'd have them open anyway. I don't know about the 'new' wing vs. the 'old' wing, but my room was spacious, clean, a big bathroom with nice amenities, a good minibar, and a decent selection of television channels, including CNN.The hotel was built in 1929, and has been restored or kept intact, as far as I can see. One could call it gloomy, I suppose. But it's authentically gloomy, if so. There are some great architectual details around, and everything needing updating seems to have been updated.The staff was helpful and friendly. The concierge arranged for dinner reservations one evening without a hitch. No questionable billing tactics or that kind of thing, everything was as it should be.Breakfast on the uppermost floor is like buffet breakfasts you get all over China: Some Western things, some Chinese things, pllus an omelette chef. It was just fine for me...Plenty to choose from, and tasty. In fact, on our last morning, they arranged a 'breakfast box' for us, as our flight was very early, and so they gave us something for the road.In all, I would say that if you like charming old hotels, and if you want to feel like you're in Shanghai the fabled 'Paris of the Orient', the Peace Hotel would be a great choice (though you might want to make sure you're in the 'right' wing or building so you get a room like mine). However, if you're more into a modern kind of place, it probably isn't for you. As for service, there may be more pampering hotels around, but there wasn't anything I wanted that couldn't be provided. "
peace hotel ,"Let it Rest in Peace We asked for a hotel with a central location and stayed there on our first and last 4 nights. On the first visit I was wondering what all the fuss was about. The hotel certainly needs a lot of capital investment but the room was clean, reasonably spacious and light. What a change though when we returned and had a room overlooking the light well in the centre. The bathroom was mouldy, the floor looked as if it had not been cleaned for some time. We changed to another, larger room on the 'executive floor' and this was shabby but cleaner. The room was very dark and even in the daylight it was only possible to read when sitting beside one of the lamps. A disproportionate number of staff had name tags stating trainee but, particularly in the dining room, they appeared to be disorganised and, in their shabby, ill fitting uniforms, somewahat lacking in customer service attributes. On the morning we left, they were still setting up breakfast when the early eaters had been and gone.Don't do it. There is no reason to choose this relic. "
peace hotel ,"Stay at Shangri La Pudong- same price better evrything!! The Hotel is truely a mixture of ancient and modern decore built in a Gothic Style, it once was known for its luxury and magnificence.(not any more!!!).We come to Shanghai often and usually stay at Pudong Shangi la which is fabulous but decided to try the Peace Hotel for a change. What a disappointment!! The only good thing about it is the location to the Bund and shops/markets. The Jazz Club is fabulous but very expensive, even coffee is so overpriced.Our room had no airconditioning as it had broken down, we asked for a reduce fee because of it but in the Peace Hotel its sorry, sorry, sorry no...no... The restaurant looks impressive but the service slow and ordinary.The worse thing is the staff so rude!!!! They need to have lessons at The Shangi la Hotel. We decided never to stay here again!! but I still stop here to visit the toilet and have coffee(even though I know I'm being ripped off) as least its clean and civilized. "

peninsula shanghai ,"Just not quite there yet... Date of Stay: November 27-29,2009Room Type: Deluxe River Vie RoomUpgrade: noneAmount Paid Per Night: 3,800RMB (560USD) plus taxesReservation Method: Peninsula WebsiteLoyalty Card: NoneAirport/Hotel Transfer: Came with the hotel package but they picked me up at the Park Hyatt instead of the airport since I was just moving between hotels. The driver doesn't speak english at all, but I'm not all that chatty anyway. Location: It's directly on the &quot;main&quot; Bund area (which is under a lot of road work these days for the World Expo in 2010) just two blocks from Nanjing Road. Taxi's don't know where the hell it is but I suppose its because it's new. Check-in: check in counter was filled with staff but they can't seem to get it right, it took them 15 minutes to get my key to work but after 15 minutes they decided to just take me up first to the room and just send up the key later. (it finally took them 2 hours to do that because of some malfunction on the system)Room: The room was weird. it was big enough to be a Junior suite or at least a Grand Deluxe room. When you enter the door you have an anteroom, ahead is the door to the bedroom and to your left is the walk in closet. The problem was the window in the bedroom was on the corner and not as big as those on the photos, it was like just 1 meter wide, so you can see part of the Pudong Skyline (with the correct angle you can see the Pearl TV tower) and on the other side you can see another river. I'm not really particular about the view but the problem was the roof of the tent they placed in front of the window which obstructed the view even more. Like I said i'm really not particular about it but when you pay so much for a river view, you expect at least a descent one. I called the operator they said the front desk is busy but will call as soon as they can, i waited for an hour, literally finished watching the latest episode on Glee on the TV from my iPod.They eventually called after I called the operator again to follow up, at first they told me there is nothing they could do about it but they could move me to a suite the following day. When I told them that since I'm only in for 2 night and having just transferred after my first night at Park Hyatt I don't want to go through the inconvenience of moving to another room again. They finally showed another room a smaller one this time but it has the same problem because half the view was blocked by the hotel building. In fact from the bed, you can only see the other side of the huangpu river, the Pudong skyline could only be seen from the side where the work desk and TV are. So left between a bigger room with half a small obstructed view or a small room with the wrong view, we settled for the bigger room.Bathroom: is big, instead of the relief shown on the bathroom photos, they have a window. The shower stall was adequate, not really small but not as big as the one at Park Hyatt either. The toilet is pretty standard, I expected it to be automated like the ones at Peninsula Tokyo or Park Hyatt Beijing &amp; Shanghai, so I was quite disappointed when I said it wasn't .Bed: Bed was very comfortable not really too soft and not hard either, but the pillows were too soft, I use down feather pillows at home and they aren't that soft...your head literally sinks on it.. Breakfast: breakfast was chaotic, it felt more like a Chinese restaurant at lunch hour than a hotel lobby and it wasn't even because of the hotel guests. You'd expect that after a month the staff would be a bit better in what they were doing than that and the american breakfast was served cold. Check-out: Check out okay but when I was going up to my room from breakfast I told the guy at the front desk that I am running a bit late for my flight and could they print my stuff so we could make it faster. But when I got down I was surprised they didn’t do anything given that the front desk didn’t have much guests so they weren’t even too busy to accede to my request.Overall Evaluation: The Peninsula never made it feel like that I was special or welcome. Okay, the &quot;Good Morning&quot;. &quot;Zhao shang hao&quot;, &quot;nin hao&quot;, is perfunctory so it doesn't really count. They won't even greet you when you pass the front desk, they would be busy minding their own stuff talking to other staff. I really have to say it wasn't very welcoming. They also have to work on their English, I have been to China so many times that I'm pretty much used to the level of English they use, but even for a new hotel (having stayed at the Le Royal Meridien and Hyatt on the Bund just months after they opened) I have to say the Peninsula staff just doesn't cut it. Would I stay there again? I doubt I would ever come back, on my next trip I might just stay at the Park Hyatt instead since they did offer a room upgrade on my next visit or the Fairmont might be open by then. "
peninsula shanghai ,"During the Soft Opening Inspite of many of the hotel's services not being fully operational, it is clear that this will be an excellent place to stay when all is completed. The rooms are spectacular. "
peninsula shanghai ,"Beautiful throughout but some work to be done on the service The Peninsula has probably the most beautiful hotel room I have ever stayed in - a perfect combination of ancient and modern Chinese, with a slice of art deco(check out the photos). Every detail is exquisite and the idea of the dressing roomoutside the bathroom is so superb I wonder why nobody has ever thought of it before.And the details are carried through into the public areas too which aregorgeous too. The bed was also the most comfortable I have ever slept in anywhere. And the internet radio worked well, as did the internet phone which allows free international calls. The service from the front of house staff was generally excellent as was the pick-upfrom the airport. But the service in the restaurants definitely needs some work. Wewent to the Cantonese restaurant one evening and the poor service let the place down- wine brought late and seemingly fresh from a microwave rather than a fridge, winerefills unforthcoming, general inattentiveness from the staff. Even worse wasbreakfast where service was pretty shoddy for a top-class hotel with wrong ordersbeing delivered, refills of tea/coffee missing, and tables generally being ignored.Worst of all was one morning when my plate was delivered with some unwanted baconwhich I had specifically said was not needed. When I said it was the wrong order thewaitress offered to remove the bacon from the plate and kindly explained that thefood had been cooked separately. Only when I explained why I wanted a new plate didshe bring one. Laughably inept.It's great that the hotel is training new staff but I'd leave it a while until thestaff are up to speed. By contrast, the other hotel we stayed in Shanghai (the Puli, seeseparate review) was impeccable. I'd give that one a go while the Peninsula gets up to speed. "
peninsula shanghai ,"Luxury After an absence of a decade, I finally returned to Shanghai, and was stunned to find a city that I barely recognized; luxury and style could be found all around.I arrived in Pudong's new terminal 2 - world class. Hoped on the Maglev Train, and has a great ride! A shame it doesn't take you all the way into town - badly thought out - but still a fun experience. Stayed at the newly opened Peninsula Hotel. Though I still prefer their Hong Kong property, their rooms were beautiful and well appointed! Was blown away by the afternoon tea in the Park Hyatt out in Pudong. Had several exceptional dinners: Mr. and Mrs. Bund, and Franck's. Both French. Service was impeccable, atmosphere lively and sophisticated, food terrific. What more can one ask. Drinks at Bar Rouge, M1NT and Lounge 18. Shanghai is definitely on its way to competing with the NY's and Londons of this world. "
peninsula shanghai ,"great potential but they still have some work to do My 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the new Peninsula for 3 nights during the second week of the soft opening. First the positives: rooms are beautiful and spacious; the closet/dressing room is huge, the bathroom is large and luxurious with separate bath and shower; the lobby is attractive (although the Lobby restaurant is too close to the hotel entrance); security is excellent, with security staff on the street and elevator access limited to guests with keys; there is a very large and welcoming staff, and every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted by more than 10 people; free international calls (and yes, this really works); they have a full time staff member at the airport to meet flights and send guests off, and he was able to help us check in for our Chicago flight in the business class line, even though we had coach tickets); good location just off the Bund (although Beijing road, just past the entrance, is crowded with tour busses and the sidewalks are jammed with tour groups); if you go in 2009 be aware that the river walk is completely closed as it is under construction for Expo 2010.Now the negatives:(I won't complain that the pool wasn't open as we had been told this in advance)check in: it took 3 tries for our room key to work when we checked ingym: good equipment but no headphones provided, no fruit (you get a towel and bottle of water when you walk in)water: you can't drink the water in China, and they supply water bottles with turn down service, but that is not enough water for tooth brushing and drinking during the day-they should supply more free water in the room (maybe stock a cabinet?)restaurants: we ate at the Lobby for breakfast daily (included in our room rate) and once for dinner, had room service dinner once, and had one dinner in the Cantonese restaurant. Each meal included between 1 and 5 errors: 2 billing errors (price on the bill was higher than the price on the menu-once in the Lobby, once in the Cantonese restaurant) and many errors about what we ordered (too numerous to list here). After the billing errors, they corrected the bills and apologized but did not offer to remove those items (as most luxury hotels in the US would have done). After the breakfast with at least 5 errors, I spoke to a manager to let him know that the wait staff was not able to understand all of our requests. concierge: although very friendly, they seem poorly trained. i asked one of them how long it would take to walk from the Pearl tv tower to the hotel, and he didn't know; then i asked if the tourist tunnel under the river was worth seeing, and he said he had never been there; these attractions are within easy walking distance of the hotel, and it seems odd that the concierge had never been there. We wanted to see an acrobat show and were not able to get tickets for the night we wanted-I don't think this makes sense at the Peninsula-they should have access to these tickets; when we got tickets for a different show, they said they would deliver the taxi directions to our room, but they never did.All of the above, I can attribute to the soft opening-everyone is still in training, and we knew we were coming during a &quot;soft opening&quot; so our expectations were not too high. But we did have one inexcusable negative experience. Our last night, the master light switch stopped working, and we were left with no ability to control the lights, in a pitch black room, with only the mood light on in the bathroom. I had to feel my way to the desk and use my computer screen as a light so that I could call the front desk. They sent a maintenance person up quickly, but it took him more than 15 minutes to figure out how to fix the lights. Being stuck in a dark room for so long was very disturbing, especially to my daughter. I called a manager and after about 20 minutes, she came to my room. I let her know how upset we were (what is the point of all those fancy controls if they don't work!) and asked her to consider adjusting our bill to reflect the light fiasco and some of the other poor service issues we had experienced.When we checked out, I was surprised to see that the bill had not been adjusted. (there was also a breakfast charge, which they promptly removed as our breakfast had been included in our rate); when i asked, the manager gave my 9 year old a teddy bear and told me she'd booked the Rolls Royce to take us to the airport. (our rate included ariport transfers). While we enjoyed the Rolls Royce, I still think they should have adjusted our bill and am certain that the Peninsula in Chicago (where we stay several times a year) would have adjusted the bill under similar circumstances. I will be traveling to China regularly on business and will think twice before returning to this hotel, unless I hear that they have sorted out their service issues. But it is beautiful, so I hope they can train their staff better to fit in with the luxurious surroundings. And I hope they are reading these reviews and taking steps to resolve the remaining issues. "
peninsula shanghai ,"Don't go yet still need time... We stayed 4 nights/5 days in the hotel. I will concede the hotel had been only opened for 3 days when we arrived but having the Peninsula badge one expects a certain level of competent service regardless of how new the hotel is. The room (an Executive Suite) was clean, nicely decorated and the welcoming chocolates from the hotel as well as a box of truffles from Armani was a nice touch. Upon unpacking we found out our room safe did not work and within moments front desk had dispatched personnel for an inspection. He was the first of two that evening. The next day the safe was still in-operable, another call went down, by the third day I gave up. I had by this time moved my valuables down to the lobby safe which was an inconvenience however I had no choice. The matter was finally solved the day before I left, when I mentioned this to the duty manager he was surprised to hear of it as he was only just informed of the situation! When I went down to the lobby safe to retrieve my valuables, the front desk clerk gently reminded me I have a room safe so it was unnecessary to have to use the lobby safe!During our stay the living room, bedroom and the bathrooms were always kept very clean. I have no complaints whatsoever with the housekeeping service. There is however a design flaw that can be a problem. In the changing room area the dressing table runs about 5' long, while very useful especially for women there is a 1 1/2&quot; gap between the wall and the edge of the table so if anything falls over you won't be able to access it, not even from the bottom as it is a sealed unit. The hairdryer is asthmatic so if you have long hair give yourself plenty of time because even at the highest fan and temperature setting it barely pumps out any hot air.The car service is a bit of a nightmare, I ordered a hotel car to fetch my daughter from her friend's house in the Pudong area (45 minutes away) The car was organized at 5:15 PM and I was assured the driver would be leaving immediately but the car did not pick up my child until almost 7 pm - we never made it to our dinner reservation that night.Our nightly rate included 2 American breakfasts (2 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon, yoghurt and granola parfait, fruit plate and toast) but the breakfast is so big neither my two daughters nor I envisioned eating it everyday for 4 days. We chose from the menu instead. The hotel should allow guests to chose their own items rather than enforce such a massive meal on individuals. To make matters worse, not one of our breakfast meal was correct - ever! The first day we had room service and even after three attempts to get it right we finally gave up, items ordered never showed even when asked for. Service in the lobby restaurant is just not what expects from a 5 star hotel. If you offer the service of pouring me a cup of tea then you had best pay attention to my cup content because I will NOT flag down wait staff to pour me a cup, DON&quot;T show up at my side as I'm pouring MYSELF a cup and tell ME it is your job - if it is your job then just do it!If I ask for the teapot to be moved closer to me just as it was about to be set down by the waitress DO NOT EVER frisbee the coaster from the other end of the table to me before coming around with the teapot! Secondly put the teacup down gently and not with a thud and a clank! This is more like dim sum hall service rather 5 star hotel service! "
peninsula shanghai ,"Peninsula Shanghai – Day three (since opening) – the Room Tech facts If there is one thing you won&quot;t be short of when you check into a room at the newly opened Peninsula Shanghai, it&quot;s a button to press. There is a myriad of them to choose from! In my standard room #723 (if such a thing exists at this luxurious establishment) there are no less that 29 panels containing various buttons, displays and sockets that you can press, read or plug things into.If there is one thing you won&quot;t be short of when you check into a room at the newly opened Peninsula Shanghai, it&quot;s a button to press. There is a myriad of them to choose from!In my standard room #723 (if such a thing exists at this luxurious establishment) there are no less that 29 panels containing various buttons, displays and sockets that you can press, read or plug things into.At the very comfortable desk, you can check the outdoor climate, to include wind velocity, and at an adjacent panel, it&quot;s possible to tune through a variety of internet radio channels. And if you still feel audio-deprived, an MP3/ ipod dock sitting above the unit permits audio playback via the hi-fi system just behind you near the big flat screen LCD TV.The 2-line sleek looking color screen desk IP phone – one of seven telephony-enabled units in the room permits free VOIP calls providing you first press the VOIP button. I tried it and it worked first time by following the simple on-screen instructions. The interface has 9 languages you can choose from, and if you want, you can pair a Bluetooth enabled device to the phone – such as a mobile phone for transferring the address book.Docking an iPOD is very straightforward, and my 3GS iPHONE worked a treat allowing me to playback my tunes. I did get a message when first docking to say it was not supported – but I pressed clear and there I was listening to The Beatles. However please note, that the unit does not charge the battery [at least on my unit] so watch out. Just above the iPOD dock on the wall, is a curtain control panel and that is mirrored on the other side – very easy to access and saves you standing up or walking 8 steps.On the side of the desk you can find a panel allowing HSIA connectivity (but no in-room supplied LAN cable), a legacy dial-up port, and a USB connector for the 4-in-one printer, fax, scanner copier that lives in a cupboard behind the desk. Again, no cable in the room. There is one power socket that is international style providing 220v and a 110v unit directly above it. Since most laptops come with auto-sensing power bricks, I guess you can say the desk has two power sockets. The same type of power sockets can be found by the TV, in the dressing area and bathroom. There are no easily available power sockets by the bed. Wi-Fi and wired broadband are free – a speedtest showed a 3Mb connection – using a LAN cable and a 100Mb port.The king size bed has night-stands on both sides and these are a mirror of each other with the same type of phone as the desk, plus a bedside control panel with another 29 buttons – seems they like the number 29 here. On the wall, there is a reading light control unit. The His and Hers controls are a nice touch but I wonder which one wins in controlling the TV...A wall unit behind the desk is a big feature in the room and houses the fax machine, Nespresso coffee maker, Mini bar fridge, DVD player, multimedia docking panel and LCD TV.The multimedia panel (concealed under the TV) has connectors and receptacles into which you should just about be able to plug everything in. This includes HDMI and four different SD/CF type cards from cameras and other digital media card using devices. The TV remote is used for the volume control. Sound reproduction is fairly crisp. There is a USB socket, but I suspect it&quot;s not for power, just files playback.As you enter the bedroom, there is (of course) a panel on your left side that can be pushed to choose one of four pre-set lighting moods, as well as let you increase or decrease humidity – dry or wet as they call it. Mine was showing 56%.The dressing area houses the room safe which is recessed into the wall, and hidden behind a panel where there is a press-type knob to release the door lock. The safe is big enough to house my 17&quot; MacBook Pro.By the mirror in the dressing area, can be found the signature nail dryer made famous by Fraser Hickox at the Peninsula Tokyo. Adjacent to that is another panel showing the outside temperature plus UV and humidity which really makes sense, since when you dress up, you need to know how many layers to wear before braving the elements. Next to that is a radio panel so you can listen to the news or your favorite local or internet based radio station. And just in case the phone rings, there is a wall-mounted handset within arms reach.A Butler box allows you to leave your laundry or shoes for polishing, and after pressing the valet call button, the valet should sprint along and pick up the items for servicing without bothering you, and this goes for returning them. It&quot;s now been more than two hours since I pressed the button, and my scuffed shoes are still there.The bathroom has two vanity units – one on either side of the room. One of them has an easily readable LCD clock on the wall, and the other is complete with A/V controls for the TV/music and a hands-free phone. There are of course power sockets at both vanity units for your toothbrush or where you can plug in the hotel supplied hairdryer.The bathtub is an area where you can control the TV, and make a phone-call - almost hands-free by utilizing the wall mounted control panel.Not to be outdone, the toilet cubicle has another phone that can be used in hands-free mode although it does have a handset as well. There is a Privacy button and Emergency Assistance call unit.Something to note is that all panels and switches are labeled in Chinese and English, and temperature controls can be switched from C to F.If you are seeking refuge from panels, switches and lights, there is just one area of the room which is free of such services and that&quot;s the shower cubicle. Here you can enjoy another type of power trip - a power shower.A nice product – my hat goes off to the Peninsula IT Team for putting it all together – I know what a struggle it must have been. And if there is one group who can make that happen – it&quot;s the PENINSULA.Another star is definitely born. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Excellent experience We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. My partner and I spent 8 nights there on vacation after a planned business trip was cancelled. We'd stay there again for either reason. The location is excellent -- 2 blocks from the Jing'An Temple metro station, in walking distance of People's Square, the French Concession and other tourist sites, and a short taxi ride to most of the places tourists go.We found our room at an amazingly low price for a Ritz -- easily less than half of what I'd expect to pay in the US and elswhere, so we were willing on arrival to upgrade to the Executinve Club level. It was worth it. This gave us 24 hour access to very helpful staff, snacks and drinks, and free business services, including internet access, plus breakfast in the morning and happy hour in the evenings. I'd highly recommend the splurge, especially since there is a charge for internet in the rooms.The rooms were up to luxury hotel standards in every way and offered good views of the city. Some on this site have described the hotel as &quot;cold,&quot; and I guess it's in the eye of the beholder. (I'm sure my mother would agree.) I found the hotel to be elegant and beautiful.The hotel is part of complex with 2 resiodentail towers for expats and a small shopping center. It was a bit too much like home for my taste (Tony Roma's, California Pizza Kitchen), but I have to admit I liked having a supermarket selling western items there, and I did go to the Starbucks. There are actually restuaurants there for many tastes, and I ate at a very good Chinese restaurant that seemed to attarct locals as well as foreigners.My only concerns -- service was inconsistent regarding the little things, like turn down, and newspaper delivery, which always occurred, but differently each day. The concierege desk could best be described as unengaged -- one sentence anwers, quick recommendations rather than asking a few questions to find out what might be best for the custormer, that sort of thing. All in all though, this was a very nice place to stay. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"5 stars hotel Excellent for everything, room is big and clean. However, internet is charged at RMB 120 / day, seems a routine for most of China hotels. Close to Plaza 66 and located at busiest street. The buffet breafast is good with many choices. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Great location terrible internet not bad for only 80€ a night The best thing about this hotel is its location &amp; the amount of useful services just outside the front door of the hotel in its own shopping complex - several restaurants, a nice massage place, a pharmacy, Starbucks, supermarket. This was great for business execs like me always in a hurry. The rooms were pretty standard, it was actually my first time to stay in a RitzC &amp; I was underimpressed. The Meredien and JW Marriott on Nanjing East road are nicer, but not in such a good location.Both myself and my co-worker had problems with the cleanliness of the room when checking in. I was totally suprised at the cheap rate on the internet - less than half the price of the Meridien 800 RMB including the buffet breakfast.The worst was the internet access that only worked about half the time and even then was abnormally slow. Staff tried to pass this off on the government blocking of sites, but I used access in the airport lounge on departure &amp; had no problem there.Hard to say if I will stay there again on my next trip to SH - the internet problem really got on my nerves. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"What Age ? Ok, there are little tell-tale signs of age (like the design of the lift lobby &amp; the architecture) but the Ritz always live up to her reputation. Great maintenance and good service. It is centrally and even have a train station (Line 2, Nanjing West station) when you want to beat the gridlock of Shanghai traffic. LobbyThe position of the reception is a little awkward. You have to go through the main entrance, past the lift lobby (to the rooms) and turn right. You have to FIND the reception for check-in.Rooms*Very Spacious in both bedroom and bathroom*Flat Screen TV*5-star toiletries amenities*Very plush mattressBreakfastIt has a good western and oriental spread at Tables.I would absolutely stay here again ! "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Close to perfection We very much enjoyed our three nights in the Ritz-Carlton, built in the late 1990s and almost venerable by local standards. If you don’t have business in Pudong, the location on West Nanjing Road is good, opposite the 1950s Soviet-style Exhibition Hall and a short taxi ride from Renmin Square. We had an excellent view SW over the French Concession. The hotel is at the centre of an upmarket apartment/office complex and shopping mall and has all the amenities of a five star plus establishment.Our Club room and bathroom were spacious and elegantly furnished and we liked the slightly retro decor in the hotel generally.In-room internet service is pay-as-you go, an irritant, but there is free access in the Club.Service in the Club and elsewhere was impeccable and we had an excellent dinner in Palladio, the hotel’s Italian restaurant. The airport arrival and departure service is expensive but greatly eases the experience.This is one of the best hotels of its type we have stayed in, anywhere, and we strongly recommend it. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"A very good hotel with exceptionally good service I have just returned from 5 days in Shanghai whilst staying at the Ritz Carlton.The hotel is in a fairly central location with a good selection of shops, restaurants and bars encircling it's entrance with further more bars and restaurants within 2 minutes walk.As you would expect from a hotel of this standard the facilities are great and the fixtures and fittings still look like new even though the hotel was refitted a couple of years ago.I stayed in the Club Level section of the hotel, slightly more expensive than the normal rooms but with the addition of Club Lounge facilities which includes business facilities as well as 6 separate dining options throughout a 24 hour period, coupled with unlimited beverages of alcoholic and the non variety throughout your stay in the Club Lounge.The service was faultless with the personal touch of even remembering your name (with all those guests names to remember I was amazed).The rooms I thought were clean and comfortable but nothing outstanding for the money paid.Drinks were about average for a 5* hotel as was room service, but if you took advantage of the club room you can save yourself a fortune but would miss out the nightlife.All in all a quality hotel which I would use again but not before I try out a couple of others I visited whilst in Shanghai. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Excellent Business Hotel with Ideal Location I stayed at the Portman with my wife for 5 nights in September. The location of this hotel is near perfect. It is two blocks from the Jing'An Temple subway station, there are plenty of taxis outside, and it's central location means it is relatively close to most neighborhoods. The latter point is important to us because Shanghai is in a constant state of traffic gridlock. Yes, there are better and newer hotels on the Pudong side, but they are not as convenient to shops, restaurants and nightlife. There is also a small market beneath the hotel that sells western food and drinks that caters to the expat population living in the two service-apartment buildings which sandwich the Portman.The room is spacious, with a flat-screen tv and a good-size bathroom, with a separate glass-enclosed shower. Our rate includes internet and breakfast, but I agree with other reviewers that the internet, if paid separately, is expensive, not to mention very slow. The breakfast has good western and asian selections. Service is sporadic. One day we were offered tea and coffee (ordered from the waitstaff but included in the buffet) and another day no one asked if we wanted them. Like most Chinese service, you just have to be pro-active and flag down the waitstaff if you want something.Overall, the experience was great, a wonderful business hotel in a central location. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Comfortable but Cold This was the last stop of a 2 week trip to China and the most pricey hotel we booked (also stayed at Regent in Beijing, Sheraton in Guilin and Yangshuo Mountain Retreat). We received a terrific rate using Agoda that we accessed via TripAdvisor's comparison pricing that was significantly less than the quoted rate on Expedia, Orbitz or others for a deluxe room with breakfast included. Only problem was that the hotel had no record of the prepaid reservation when we arrived and spent several (about 15-20) minutes looking for the record of the reservation despite our copy and then finally agreed that we were entitled to a room there. The room was large with excellent toiletries in the bathroom and had a lovely separate glass shower and deep soaking bathtub. Buffet breakfast was huge and included Chinese, Western and Japanese specialties , though the tea and coffee service was slow and servers often had to be searched for. The entire &quot;feel&quot; of the hotel was cold and impersonal. In addition, there was a substantial daily internet charge that seemed inappropriate for a hotel that is so expensive to begin with and the cost in the Business Center was ever higher. The location of the hotel was terrific--close to the subway and there was easy access to inexpensive taxicabs as well. This hotel was clearly elegant but had a generally &quot;cold&quot; and not charming feel to it. I prefer charm. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,It is very perfect hotel. I think there is perfect food and services there.And the I like the envirenment there. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Very good business hotel I stayed at this hotel for my first trip in Shanghai on business. The hotel upgraded me and my colleagues to a club room. The room was very spacious, nicely furnished and had a nice big bathroom. The service at the hotel was very good, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is fantastic (Nanjing Road West, near Plaza 66) - lots of shops and restaurants in the vicinity. If you wish to venture to other areas of the city this can easily be done via taxi which is very cheap in Shanghai. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Excellent food excellent service! Every thing is good! I felt very comfortable in there. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Lub It This hotel has been around for a while, and even though the exterior is charmless, I was very happy with the newly renovated rooms. I still like it for its location, service, and also very importantly, its been around for so long that taxi drivers will definitely know how to get you there. With almost any other destination, you literally have to guide the taxi driver on a street-by-street basis to your destination. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Where everybody knows your name The Ritz Carlton hotels just exemplify great service. I have stayed for business twice now at this hotel and the reception is always amazing. There is a staff member waiting to pick you up at the airport and then when you arrive they are waiting and take you directly to your room to check in (no front desk waiting). This is so welcome after a very long flight. Through out the week I was also greeted repeatedly in the lobby by staff and by name many times. The staff is so available for a quick question or help.The rooms are impeccable, and the bathrooms are always lovely. Amazing large tub and shower. The beds are very comfortable and wonderful flat screen t.v.'s. The gym was very nice and had a lot of equipment available. I never had an issue finding a machine to work out on. Food and restaurants are great. The hotel has a great buffet breakfast. In the Portman plaza there are also some other great places where you can get some western food. I'd recommend Element Fresh! You can also shop many malls in walking distance. Its a great area, a lot of business and expats here. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Doesn't quite live up to expectations I've stayed at the Portman Ritz Carlton before while visiting Shanghai and had the opportunity to stay there again this month after a break of about 6 years.While there's been a distinct improvement in the rooms, there's been a distinct drop in the service levels.At check in, the staff attempted to shoe horn me into a twin room even though a king bed had been booked and confirmed under the guise that the hotel was 'completely full'. Twenty minutes later, a room with a king bed had magically become available.The room itself was very pleasant. Good furnishings. Great bath with an waterproof pillow attached to the top. The shower had a good range of temperature and pressure.Food options were limited but there are a couple of international outlets like California Pizza Kitchen right outside the hotel.Breakfast is currently served at the Tables restaurant and the restaurant has to be accessed from outside the hotel due to renovations in progress. The breakfast selection is standard with nothing particularly to pique the curiosity.The airport transfer is very expensive and I wish cheaper but equally convenient options were available.In all, a decent hotel but completely lacking in the service one would expect from a Ritz Carlton. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"High quality business hotel Use this hotel regularly as it is located near my office. High standards of staff service, rooms good size, and usual business services available. secure. Near restaurants of various styles and price levels, convenient for business district. Drive from or to Pudong airport can he hair raising. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"partially renovated hotel is full of amenities but showing its age Service is typical of China, which is not that great compared with other Asian countries where hotel service is among the best in the world. Restaurant food is ok, but not great. The complex has everything, including a starbucks, HSBC, Paul's French bakery/ restaurant, pool, etc. However, with all the new hotels in the major Chinese cities, this one is starting to lag (though at one point in time, this hotel set the standard in Shanghai). Hotel is +/- 20 years old, and has been thru 1-2 renovations already. However, some parts are still looking old, such as the hallways with brown/rust colored carpet and out of date furniture. Location seems a bit out of the way from the new center of town, which seems to be closer to the Huangpu river. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Finally Renovated but I didn't like the decor Pros- Great Location- Great public areas- Rooms were finally renovated- Still the best breakfastCons- Hate the new colors- Service is nice, but nothing spectacularI've stayed here several times over the years for work. So I've seen its many sides throughout the years. The hotel was recently renovated and that's the good news. The bad news is the new coloring was not as nice as it was 6-7 years ago. The brownish room coloring gives it an old feeling and made me feel as if I was 75 yrs old. Bathrooms were impressively updated with full marble and glass and that's a good thing. In fact, the brown-colored bathroom themed seemed to match the room decoration. That may have been why I didn't feel fully comfortable sleeping in the rooms.Good news is the public areas are still spectacular. All these years, the public areas were always immaculately clean. The restaurants, while nice, are overpriced. Buffet meals were excellent (still on of the best buffet breakfasts in Shanghai) and the dinner buffet is more geared for the western business travelers. The location is great as it's on Nanjing road, yet not located in the heavily congested parts of East Nanjing Road. Service was good, yet slow. Check-in process had some language barriers (us Americans speak a bit too fast sometimes) but no major problems. Food service in restaurants was good as well, even though it was only for the buffet services. Note, RC Portman is expensive, as you would expect for its brand. So not a great value, especially compared to the Le Royal Meridien. I think both hotels are equal and the preferences are largely dependant on preferences. Le Royal Meridien is newer but the hardware does seen a bit too modern for my tastes. I do prefer RC Portman's location because driving here isn't as bad as trying to get to Le Royal Meridien's prime Nanjing location in downtown Shanghai. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Comfortable Puxi-side luxury hotel in a calm(er) part of town Overall, this hotel offers a luxurious experience at a competitive price. While the property is compact, it still manages to have almost everything a business or pleasure traveller would want. While some might argue that you won't get a true local flavor by staying here, the relative calm and order of this property will quickly make up for it. Finally, for first-timers who don't mind spending a little more, the limo service is the smart way to go for getting in/out of the airport. Some points that I hope are useful:-Streets / sidewalks aren't as congested as other parts of town-Standard rooms have plenty of space for two with lots of hidden treats strewn about. Lots of closet space and drawers for long-term stays. Even with the discount rate, we were able to score a 29th floor room.-If you expect to rely on public transportation, this area might disappoint. There are indeed a couple subway stations within walking distance, but the hotel itself is just far enough that taking a taxi will almost always be the better option.-If you intend on walking, factor in about 40 mins to get to People's Square (with a couple hair-raising road crossings on the way). -A lot of expats reside in the area, which could be good or bad; it also means many chain-store options: the downstairs Starbucks is definitely convenient, but the high-end boutiques within and around the hotel (along with their prices) aren't any different than those you'd find in other international cities.-Check-in/out is a quick and orderly experience; while you might experience some line cutting, just be assertive and your time won't be wasted.On a personal note, this was my first trip to Shanghai and I opted for this hotel over the Radisson New World. I noticed that the prices were just about the same and were both in the part of town I wanted to stay in (i.e. Puxi side / Nanjing Road). My main concern had been the lack of transportation options, but I found Shanghai taxis to be quick and efficient (as long as you have your directions written in Chinese ready), and I never felt like I was being cheated. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Lovely hotel right on Nanjing Road Since being renovated, hotel rooms are very nice. They are spacious, with a fabulous bathroom. We stayed on the Club Floor. The lounge was great, with wonderful views. Food was tasty in lounge and in Cafe. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"A piece of home in Shanghai! I stayed at the Portman while on business with a large group. The Portman was extremely comfortable, as you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. The beds gave us great sleep after long days! The rooms and bathrooms are extremely large which is always nice. The hotel itself is in a Western business park with everything from Starbucks to California Pizza Kitchen. After traveling in Asia for 2 weeks, we did succumb to CPK one night, and it was nice to have that American option. The hotel was in a great location- we never waited more than a few minutes for a taxi, and there is no reason not to take a taxi when they are dirt cheap! The breakfast is incredible, it was included in our room rate and there was an incredible selection of food- American and Chinese. Room service was also very good. The only complaint that I would have is that our power went out numerous times. We had a faulty hair dryer- even if it was not on, it would blow a fuse if you opened the drawer it was in. They were pretty good about sending an engineer up quickly, but after the 5th time it was getting pretty frustrating. I was constantly in and out for meetings, so there was no time to change rooms, although they never gave us that option. If I was to go back to Shanghai I would definitely consider staying here again. You don't get a very authentic Chinese experience, but that was OK for me on this trip. Shanghai was wonderful- the city is incredible and I would love to go back. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Great atmosphere with an incredible energy and buzz throughout the hotel. Lobby Lounge has great teas, perfect for the afternoon. Great atmosphere. Comfortable. A new favorite place for afternoon tea. Would definitely recommend friends! "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"great hotel!!!! I visit Shanghai 3-4 times a year and try to always stay at this hotel. great location close to shopping and bar/restaurant areasnice sized rooms and very well kept hotel in general. The gym is also above average. service is attentive and very helpful, they could do something about the internet service which can be slow and there is no wireless "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Very good hotel The hotel is quite old for Shanghai but I think the rooms must have been redecorated very recently. They're very good. Big bathroom, LCD TV and DVD. There's a shopping center outside with a western supermarket, Starbucks and that sort of thing.I've stayed here a few times. I don't mind staying again. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Very Nice Very nice-truly first class...loved the western food available in the same location (good for first time visitors). Excellent service and very helpful. Not for folks who want real local color-all upscale places nearby-but fun to see. Great for the price. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Beautiful Hotel The hotel does not disappoint, although compared to the new Beijing Ritz the room is smaller and pricier. However it is still up to the Ritz standard. Professional staff, large clean room with nice amenities. Very helpful front desk and concierge service. I did not dine at the hotel restaurants. Within walking distance there are plenty of nice restaurants, likely with much more reasonable price tabs. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Brilliant. Great Place I stayed at the Portman on business. It compares favorably with the other hotel in Shanghai that I have stayed in (Hilton). Very large rooms and quite reasonably priced due to our company deal with them. Excellent location in Nanjing Road. Very nice bar to enjoy live music and drinks. Not so sure about the restaurants. can get better value elsewhere. Th Chinese restaurant is too fancy but rubbish in terms of food quality. I didnt try to Japanese place.Good swimming pool. But it was deserted. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Nice and comfortable hotel Stayed at the Portman a few days ago for a friends wedding. Had high expectations of the hotel as its a ritz, the hotel met all my expectations. The room was a good size, bed was comfortable. Check in was fast and efficient even though they spelt my name wrong so it took longer to find my reservation. Room service was fast and the food was good. The Japanese restaurant however was not good and very pricey for shanghai standards. would not reccomend it. Location is decent, lots of very high end shops in plaza 66 which is right next door. Overall the hotel was above average for the hotels Ive stayed in shanghai. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Top choice in Shanghai Was in Shanghai end of October for an exhibition, and stayed at Ritz...the rooms are really nice, and over-all excellent service.I have taken a few photos of the rooms for everyone to see. The room I booked was I think around 50m2.The Jazz bar is quite good if you want to wind down and stay in for the night.Only downside is the elevators, as it is always a huge fight to get in during mornings and around dinner time...the hotel should really do something about this, as most Mainlanders don't know the concept of lining up! "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"brand new! Brand new! Yes, The Portman has just completed it 's much awaited renovation. I did of course called the hotel to make sure that it's true before booking a room there - last thing I want to hear is the never-ending drilling and hammering. I have always preferred to stay here as the location is central and usually takes me less than 20 minutes to get anywhere and everywhere in Puxi area. But avoided the hotel during the early months this year because of the renovation. Rooms are nice and the club lounge area is super spacious! Love it!!! Oh - they also bombed their previous coffee house and transformed it to a nice contemporary all-day dining. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"The best hotel in Shanghai After staying 4 days in the &quot;Pennysula hotel&quot; in Beijing, we were very happy to be in Portman where was/is/will be a true five star hotel both in price and in service. The room was lovely with all the good quality amenities. The service was better than excellent. We were at the executive club floor, the staff were extremely helpful and attentive, I went there the last day to tip Simon Wang who was extremely helpful and friendly, but he was not there unfortunately. We ate at the Chinese Restaurant, which is excellent as usual. Good taste, good portion and reasonable price. The Italian restaurant however is another story. It's excellent as usual, but the price? Put in this way, you need a small mortgage to eat there.Generally speaking, we had a much better time in Shanghai than Beijing. Portman has always been our favourite hotel since our first stay in 1998. Good location, good service and good food. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Brand new hotel with good location After remodling, the room is great &amp; the location of the Ritz Carlton could not be better.Service is phenomenal. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Not as great as expected Before my trip i was excited to stay in a Ritz Carlton, and my expectation was way too high! However on arrival i was disappointedThe lobby was very average, the room was below average with not much of real luxury as we get in Indian 5 star hotelsService was good, with the staff being responsiveOver all i would not recomend the hotel "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Love the check in - love the Club I just think this place is the greatest! I had booked a Club room and a sedan from the airport. As I walk out of Customs, I am greeted by the usual smiling airport representative, who this time informed me that if I so desired he would complete my check in process while we waited for the car to come around!! What a great set-up!!! Mind you the car is alsways there in few minutes, but now; instead of just standing around waiting I could get all my check in process completed. When inquiring if this was a new Club service he said &quot;Not at all, just an additional service, so you can enjoy your time in Shangha more&quot; I was floored! When is Ritz opening an airline???? "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"A little out of the way but a great comfortable room! I was prepared based on reviews here that the hotel was a little out of the way and it was. The hotel described it as a 5 min. walk from the Line 2 W. Nanjing station but with big luggage in tow and sore feet it was more like 10-15 min. It was very easy to find, though! Based on later taxi rides I definintely would have taken a &lt;$2 cab ride from the subway station to the hotel. We arrived from the rail station around 9am with crossed fingers that they'd let us check-in and it wasn't even mentioned - we were given a fantastic room with a great view of the Shanghai Exposition Center across the street. The bed was ridulously comfortable and the room was well appointed with nice decor and a large flat-panel tv with multiple English channels. The bathroom was decked to the nines and was designed very cool and trendy. Within moments of getting to our room our tickets to the Shanghai Acrobats were delivered. We were delighted to find out the acrobat theatre was on level 4 of the hotel - we had no idea before checking in! A Starbuck's, California Pizza Kitchen, Tony Romo's, pharmacy and grocery store are all located in the Shanghai Centre complex and all in all the hotel is not too far of a walk from the busier area of Nanjing, Yu Yuan Gardens or Jade Buddha Temple. There is a dim sum restaurant across the street named Bi Feng Leng (or something similar) that was a great treat - ask for an English menu! Concierge was very helpful, it was easy to catch a cab and overall I truly enjoyed my stay. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Love Portman Ritz Just came back from Portman Ritz Carlton. I love the hotel. The renovated room is splendid and abundant ammenities are available. Service is excellent, the concierge is very helpful in helping you to find the places that you are looking for. Location is at nanjing xi lu which is in the location for upscale designer brand malls-- excellent location to the metro line 2 which is 2 blocks away from the hotel. One downside of the hotel: it is still undergoing renovation work in some floors so expect to hear drilling sound as early as 7:30am. But overall this is the hotel with splendid room, excellent location and outstanding service. I will definitely stay here again. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Good service; updated rooms are nice This is my second stay at the Portman Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai. Service was top-notched during both of my stays. During the most recent stay, I was in one of the newly updated rooms. Very nice, indeed. The hotel definitely needed the upgrades. I was satisfied for the value of the hotel.Also, during my stay, I was not feeling very well. During breakfast I asked the server if there was a pharmacy nearby. I was pleasantly surprised when later that day there was a &quot;get-well&quot; card from the hotel staff in my room. Nice touch! By the way, the hotel is located in an area which caters to ex-pats. There is a pharmacy there, and a medical clinic next to it.The overall location is convenient to shops and restaurants, albeit a little pricey given the prime location. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Nice hotel - bad service Stayed 2 weeks in this hotel. The location of this hotel is very good: In the center of Shanghai on Nanjing W rd, the hotel includes all kind of facilities from a Starbuck to a very good swimming pool. I had to deal with 3 issues that make me think that this hotel is a bad choice:- Value for money is not there: 380 RMB for breakfast (50USD). Room rate 1300 RMB (for a simple room).- Personal in the lobby is unfriendly and glance at you - No security, anybody can use the lift and reach your room. This is an issue if you consider that you can enter the hotel from 3 sides.There are plenty of alternative in Shanghai offering the same and more for a lower rate. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,average hotel i stayed first time in this hotel more than 10 years back from those days till now shanghai has had an amazing development and this property didntnow is an average hotel with maybe a great entrance for the same price you have much better options in pudong and puxi also i dislike location restaurants downstairs are not an option and there is not really good options walking distance other than bi feng tang 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Not so impressed with this hotel Stayed in the Ritz-Carlton for the weekend in Shanghai. Note that they are renovating the rooms, club lounge, the all-day restaurant and the ground floor outside, so there is noise both from the top and bottom of the hotel.Most rooms have however now supposedly been renovated, which means a 'larger bathroom' and a flatscreen TV.On the surface all seems fine, but there are niggles that make me wonder about this hotel. First they charge for internet, up to 96 RMB per night. I plugged in my Mac and it didn't work, so I ring the business centre, and they say that &quot;our network doesn't work with Apple computers&quot;. In fact at the end I had the 'duty manager' and a business centre woman with breath that could have killed small children in my room, and I fixed it myself with entering the data myself into the network settings.Breakfast was the budget of a small African country, so I went to Starbucks round the corner - where there is also a HSBC and a very nice little supermarket full of imported goods. I left the shopping in my room because it was being cleaned. When I came back the shopping was gone, and it took hours to be returned, with no explanation or apology.The standard room is very small, but reasonably well fitted out. but again, a mistake - they put in a DVD player, but it plays Chinese DVDs only. And the TV is stuck to the wall, so I could not plug in my computer.Not sure whether I would stay here again, it was a long walk to the metro, and surrounded by shopping centres rather than anything touristic. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Newly Reno Rooms Perfect I arrived here Jan.3 and stayed for 2 nights. I was treated royally and given one of the newly renovated king rooms. It was impeccable. I have stayed at several Ritz hotels in United States and this one superceded the rest in all respects. The swimming pool is long for good length swims. The health club amenities are first class in every respect. The room service was second to none the most rapid I had anywhere in the world. When I asked for help with their internet connection I barely hung up the phone and a very well spoken English speaking Chinese duty manager was at my service. I stayed one night on the 18th floor and the other night on the 20th floor. The bathrooms were comparable to the suites at the Bellagio and the fine details like the Wall Street Journal being delivered in an exquisitely woven bag was impressive. A very big bowl of fresh fruit was in the rooms both nights with two bottles of well needed water. I found every attention to detail in the room and the hotel excellent. The American ones should take a lesson from what is presented here. As I found with traveling worldwide you are best to eat local foods and stay away from the American attempts. I did try a deluxe hamburger one night and found it was as bad as the one I once had at the Hilton in Amsterdam so it was again not a wise choice. Oriental influenced fish, chicken, and pork dishes were finely presented in the Tea Garden. While I have had better food in some 5 star hotels I really had no complaints with the traditional Chinese foods cooked and served here. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,There's better... Good luxury hotel where you can meet executives or 'famous' people. But it's not really central (need to walk a few blocks or take a cab to be in the city's shopping and restaurants areas). A much better place to stay is the central New Jin Jiang Tower hotel in the French Concession district (not to mix with the older Jin Jiang Tower) which became my favorite hotel after 4 trips in Shanghai. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Not worth the money The hotel is very well located and offers quite a bit of shopping within walking distance but fails to meet the expectations that come with the prices they charge.PROSGreat location and friendly staff. CONSThe rooms decor is older and needs updating. The TVs and other equipment in the rooms is also in need of some serious investment. If you have the option, skip the $40 buffet breakfast and talk a walk outside. Not only is the breakfast $38 to $40 including service but its not very good.I was very surprised that a Ritz-Carlton hotel that had 3-4 security personel in the lobby at all times allowed prostitution to be openly sold on their lobby and second floor bars. After 10-11 PM or so, prostitues (at least were high class) could be seen hanging around the lounge, bar and elevators.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it based on the cost and inability to meet the standards it sets with those prices. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Good somewhat indifferent experience I first stayed at the Portman back in 1992 when it was still a Shangri-La property. It was later acquired by the Ritz Carlton chain,and I have stayed a half-dozen times over the last two or three years, including the last couple of days. In 1992 it was state-of-the-art, and the pride of Shanghai. With a veritable explosion of five-star properties in recent years the Portman is finding it tougher to keep up.The lobby is magnificent in that it gleams with the quality of a Ritz combined with a bit of Far East mystery. The bar area is attractive and comfortable, and though cab lines are often long, the front entry is unique and its own mini-city.The rooms range from decent to good, but are a bit outdated in several respects, ie, telephones are from the early 1990's and sufferclarity problems, some rooms have old shower/tub combo units that aremore Marriott that Ritz, other rooms have coffee makers and the like.Or not. Go figure. None of this variation is rate-related, mind you.Th interesting thing about the Ritz chain is that, while I am a frequent guest at several around the globe, if I have a pet peeve it is usually that they are all too similar, devoid of local content. While you can generally rely on high quality surroundings (some a little dusty perhaps), they have a tendency to be a bit boring in their 'sameness'. In the Portman's case, I find the opposite to be true: a unique property with local flavor, but lacking the standards - and even guest attentiveness - of a typical Ritz. Stay at a Ritz in many locales more than once and you are greeted with a hearty &quot;welcome back!&quot;. At the Portman they struggle to find your reservation, are a bit indifferent, and overall perfunctory in attitude. They have no clue whether you have been there before, and often do not scan down the screen far enough to find special request info without you having to point it out. I will say the wait-staff and the room service staff are solid.Overall, I like the property, but I am sampling others (I go to Shanghai four times a year). On my last trip I hit the Four Seasons.Pretty good! "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Luxury Service Standard Room I stayed here for 7 nights in room 4407. The location of the Portman RC makes it very convenient to the United Plaza and Plaza 66 office buildings in Puxi. There are also a lot of shops and restaurants in this area so nothing to complain about the location. The service was very good, which I suppose is to be expected as it is a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The staff address you by name most of the time, always helpful, etc. My room was on a high floor (the 44th of 45) and was very nice, but showing its age. Apparently some rooms (called &quot;Shanghai rooms&quot;) have been remodeled with larger bathrooms and plasma TV's. My room was not in this category and I don't know how they determine who gets one and who doesn't as I was never offered a choice and didn't learn about this until after reading about it later. The TV was very small and the bathroom of average size without a separate shower like many luxury properties have these days. Still the room was very nice in general. I would say my only point of dissatisfaction was the prices charged for laundry and the minibar. Usually doing your laundry at a hotel, even a good one, in Shanghai is relatively inexpensive but the Portman RC charges prices comparable to hotels Tokyo. A shirt costs around $7. A coke from the minbar around $5. I don't like hotels, especially ones that are supposed to offer the highest levels of service, to charge high prices for these kind of little extras. The room rate, which I know in advance and agree to before arrival, should reflect the level of the hotel and they shouldn't try to gouge you for the little things after arrival. Still the Portman RC remains a good choice for people having business in the Puxi side of Shanghai. Not sure I would stay here again if it wasn't so convenient for my business. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Pretty Good but could be better I have stayed at numerous RC properties around the world. This one has the type of service expected, but nothing that goes out of the way to be beyond your expectations. We stayed Club Level for 4 nights, and found the food to be somewhat repetitive. The staff was very helpful with directions for taxi, but did not have great information for trips outside of Shanghai. The hotel is in a really good location, with easy access to the Bund by train (5-8 min) or taxi (15 min). Also, really good shopping within walking distance. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Wonderful Service My daughter and I spent about a week at the Portman Ritz in early June and returned for several days in late June. We had a Club Level room with access to the Lounge on the 43rd Floor.If you don't need to be near Pudong for specific business reasons, the location of the Portman Ritz is fine. There is shopping nearby, you can walk (20 minutes) to the French Concession or the museums in People's Square. It is a cab ride to the restaurant district on the Bund, or Xintandi or Taiking Lu or LuLuan gardens but cabs are cheap if slow in rush hour traffic. For informal light meals, there is a charming Chinese sidewalk restaurant right across Nanjing Road from the Ritz and also an Element Fresh (Swiss chain) right next to the hotel. There are subway stations about 3 blocks in either direction from the hotel. and the subway in Shanghai is very doable, the best way to get to Pudong as well as to connect to the MagLev (high speed train) for the trip to Pudong Airport. I cannot say enough good things about the staff at the Club Lounge. They were unfailingly helpful with all sorts of things....restaurant reservations, airplane reservations, reservations at other (non Ritz) hotels in other cities, a credit card problem...no request or problem is beyond their scope of work. They greet you by name and remember you when you return. I would say they are about the best-trained hotel staff I have ever encountered. Our double room was fine, recently renovated and decently equipped. Don't be put off by the unappealing entrance court of the hotel complex, but do be careful where you walk as the drop-off area is chaos for pedestrians. The breakfast and other snack food in the Club Lounge was excellent. The room service was very good as well. One night we ordered our late night supper to be brought up to the Club Lounge which is open and staffed 24 hours with a computer station, wireless internet, and a bottomless supply of Perrier. The health club was very good with plenty of up to date equipment. The indoor-outdoor pool is not resort-like, but pretty nice for an urban hotel. When we went on to the Peninsula in Beijing a couple of weeks later, we realized how the Portman Ritz had spoiled us. The Club Level Lounge at the Penisula closed at 11 and shut off the wireless internet at that time. Unbelieveably, even the hotel-wide Business Center shut at midnight. We were travelling without a laptop for this segment of the trip and this was a real problem. Don't these people know know that midnight in Beijing is noon in New York? The Portman Ritz may not be the most beautiful or dramatic hotel from an architectural point of view in Shanghai, but it definitely would be my first choice for return trips. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Not bad We stayed here May 2007 and it is one of those Ritz Carlton's that is not really a RITZ. It is clean and has everything that you need, but it is older and the furniture in the rooms is slightly beat up, the decor is a little dated. I enjoyed my stay because I am usually looking for clean and convenient, which it was. But, I would not pay top dollar to stay here. I liked the location - close to everything but is a little quieter (if there is such a thing in Shanghai) neighborhood. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Better than expected After having read some of the other reviews, I was a little bit scared. Had to choose the hotel as I was visiting a friend living nearby. I chose a Shanghai Rooms and I can say the hotel was better than expected: great service, nice lobby (a little dark and stretched but very elegant), nice rooms recently renovated (very nice bathrooms). Laundry service was excellent (my shirts has been packed as they were brand new), nice food with a very good Sunday brunch with free Champagne. The hotel is based on a main shopping street, 15min from the Bund and very close to other nightlife areas.One regret: I only spent there two nights... "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Seems over-rated I am staying at this hotel on business right now. The rooms are very nice like you would expect at a Ritz Carlton.There is something wrong with the elevators, since we have had long waits to get on one of them. Maybe they are programmed wrong or there are not enough elevators, but the waits are just too long.With our group of four travelers, half of us are booked in Club rooms, the other half regular rooms, so we cannot meet for breakfast, since the Club room breakfast floor 43 is only available for Club rooms. None of us understand why they split us up this way, and management does not seem to care.Hotel management seems oblivious to any concerns of guests. I am not sure why they are like this, but this does not seem like a five star hotel at all. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,worst concierge service The hotel is perfect for the location. The rooms are large and well re-furnished.But the concierge service is the worst . They have no clue of any restaurant in the city or show happening in town. They don't speak english very well and sometimes they can be very rude. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"totally exceeds expectation We read some of the previous reviews and we requested a shanghai room via email to the hotel. To my surprise, the staff called me all the way from China to confirm my details. I was very pleased to their quick response.When we arrived, we got upgraded to the exeutive suite. The room was very spacious, clean and was everything you can think of in a 5 star hotel. The linen of the bedding was the best. The blanket was soft and so comfy. You'll feel like you're sleeping on the million dollars.It was located in the heart of Shanghai City which is very convicenient and close to all tourist spots. So if you are looking for good location, this hotel won't disapoint you. I was glad that I didn't choose Grand Hyatt as it was too far away from everything. On the last day, my husband got sick and it's such a relief to know that there is an English speaking medical centre in the hotel. The services of staff was fantastic.The hotel got eveything more than you need and I will definitely stay there again.The only low point for me was the feather pilow was too soft. So if you can't sleep on the soft pillows like me, please bring your own. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"This is a Ritz? OK, so I live in Atlanta (former HQ for Ritz Carlton and home to three of their properties), so my expecations are high, but this feels more like a Marriot (pulling up to the door feels *exactly&quot; like the Marriot Marquis in Atlanta) than a R-C. God help the pedestrian trying to cross the taxi area! Navigating the lobby is ridiculous, as the central elevator area makes it hard to walk through when it's crowded. Room size and amenities are OK, but the furnishings feel a little worn out and not up to RC's normal luxury standards. I do like the light controls on the nightstands, and turndown service was better than at many properties. Based on a fellow travelers reccomendation, I'll try the Four Seasons next time. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Depends which room you book I stayed in the hotel for 3 days for work purposes. Originally I was given a simple room which was old and dated. I was very disappointed as I expected that the &quot;Ritz&quot; would be nice.As I got to my room, it was still not ready for me, as it was been cleaned. I waited for 30 minutes, and then i went back to my room. The key to the room was not working. Again, I went downstairs to get a new key: again, it didn't work! So for 45 minutes i was trying to just get to a room which was paid for after a 12+ hour flight.I was then given an upgrade to a nicer room, which was just perfect!!! it had marble sink, massive plasma TV, and a great decor. So depending on the room you book- you may have a great holiday, or a pretty disappointing experience. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Great Location Great View Great Service We spent two weeks at the Portman Ritz-Carlton. We had a wonderful experience and enjoyed every bit of it.We arrived on Dec 30, 2006 with our (almost) 3 year old daughter. The light arches at the entrance made the hotel a very welcoming place. The bell man was very helpful. After he delivered our luggage, he stayed and told us where to park in the future and how to validate parking etc.We stayed on the 34th floor. The room is comfortable but nothing fancy. However, the view has more than made it up. Our windows directly overlook the Shanghai Exhibition Center. The holiday lights on the historical building looked spectacular. Too bad that we didn't take any picture of it before the lights were turned off on the Jan. 3.The location was convenient to many good shopping and dinning spots. Simply walking on the streets outside of the hotel in the evenings (when it is not too cold) was very enjoyable. It is two blocks away from the nearest metro (subway) station.On New Year's eve, after seeing the Shanghai Acrobatic in the Theater on the 4th floor, our daughter was hungry. We ended up getting room service for her. She got the full Ritz-Carlton treatment for an order of kids meal. Lucky for us, she only did that twice during our whole stay.The breakfast buffet was dependable, but could use more variations (especially when you have it for two weeks straight). However, it didn't bother the kid at all. She enjoyed her daily rice congee with pickles and fried eggs with bacons occasionally.The lobby staff and restaurant managers would greet our kid and spent time talking and playing with her every day. When we mentioned that our kid's birthday was coming up in February, the staff sent a birthday tray with her name on the cookie to our room. On our last day, one of the staff bought toys (most likely with her own money) for her. The Ritz-Carlton lion is now one of her favorite. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Terrific Hotel - Ignore the Negative Reviews I stayed at the Portman Ritz Carlton - Shanghai twice in January 2007, and I highly recommend this hotel. First, the location is unbeatable, and world-class shopping and conveniences are immediately outside the front door. The lobby and other public areas are very modern and stylish, with a Chinese flair. Thus, I can only imagine that these areas were very recently updated based on certain negative reviews that are on this site. I do know that the SHANGHAI rooms are the most recently renovated; thus, make sure you are guaranteed such a room when making a reservation. A business colleague that did not have a Shanghai room was disappointed since the room needed updating. Every staff member I encountered was bilingual to a point. I strongly recommend this hotel, particularly if you must have comprehensive business services available. Finally, I upgraded in order to have Club Level access, and the food, beverage, service, and privacy were well worth the extra juans/RMBs. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,love this hotel! Stayed the second time at this hotel and the services are just perfect! Liked everything! 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Great workout room Stayed in a recently renovated &quot;Shanghai&quot; Room, very luxurious, very Ritz-Carlton. Service was great for Shanghai, but nothing compared to say Tokyo or Hong Kong. Slightly offhand attitude of some staff, but in general, more than satisfactory. Concierge was very efficient and helpful.The private hotel transport (an Audi A8 or the Chinese equivalent i think) was very good, and reasonably cheap (about $25 per hour) and while about 5 times more than a cab, still a good deal. Great for a night out on the town with someone special.What was outstanding, however, were the workout facilities. All Life Fitness equipment including a large number of bikes and treadmills, as well as a full range of weight machines.Sauna, steam room, two jaccuzis, swimming pools, squash court all in top condition. Best of all was the service of the staff. Constantly replacing water bottles, handing out cold wet towels etc.Also, every bike and treadmill has a personal LCD TV with full cable tv. This hotel is a good option "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Excellent Service Good Hotel I'll start with the bad. My room at this property was probably not to Ritz standard. It was probably a bit nicer than a typical Sheraton or Marriott. Primary negatives were the dated bathroom (still nice) and rather firm bed (though bedding is quite nice). So no real complaint, just not quite what I would expect at Ritz-Carlton. All business amenities are provided or available.On the major plus side, the nominally disappointing room condition was more than made up for with very excellent service, as should expected with this brand. I was here for 5 nights and as such got a good picture for the quality of housekeeping, dining, laundry, bell, etc. All top notch. The hotel gym is also excellent, for those bringing their workout clothes.Internet access is charged by the minute, capped out at 100 RMB/day. The location is about 3 Km west of Bund. Taxi to virtually any attraction is 12-20 RMB (&lt; $3 US) and fast, so don't get hung up on location complaints. Taxi to PVG was about 200 RMB (~$30). "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Loved the Ritz-Carlton! We had a wonderful experience at the Ritz-Carlton Portman. We got a great deal through Travelocity for about $250 a night. The entrance has an impressive design and the furnishings are hip. The rooms are very beautiful. It's everything you'd expect from a five star hotel. The staff is professional and helpful. The concierge helped us get a private tour guide and driver to take us around the city for a day. It was definitely worth it! Our tour guide was excellent...she spoke English very well and customized the day around what we were most interested in. We liked her so much, that we hired her a second day to take us shopping. The only downside is that there are not enough people at the concierge desk. There were a few times when I called and no one answered and when we went down to the desk, we had to wait about 5 - 10 minutes before we could talk to someone. We would definitely stay here again. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Luxury all the way The Ritz-Carlton is on the West side of the river and near to the main shopping street - Nanjing Road. The executive club rooms are luxurious and very well-equipped. The staff in the executive Lounge all speak excellent English and are friendly and very helpful. The Bund waterfront is easily accesible by taxi and the Tourist Train (a Disney-Like experience whose flashing-lights are not for epileptics) is an easy route to the sky-scrapers of Pudong on the opposite side of the river. Great breakfasts and a very happy Happy Hour. We stayed four nights - and wished it had been longer. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"great hotel The trick is to stay at the newly renovated Shanghai room or club level, slightly more expensive (my company has a corporate rate) than the standard room (everyone on this site complained about) - new rooms are better decorated, with separate shower stall, beautiful bathrooms and Plasma TV. I personally like Portman, it's a convinient place to stay for a foreigner who does not speak chinese (don't need to carry a hotel card with the name in chinese, every taxi driver in town knows &quot;portoman&quot;), service is efficient (they always greet me on the curbside if I order airport transfer and have all the papers ready to sign, no wait in line for check in). Also, very convinient to have everything you might need at hand and with staff speaking great english - airline offices, western run medical center, banks, wine store, element fresh, pharmacy, post office, etc. I have stayed at other 5 star international hotels in Shanghai and none of them can beat Portman on location front. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Worn and old hotel in a city with many new and luxurious options I have long preferred to stay with the Portman, given its location, service and well-established reputation in Shanghai. This last visit shattered my earlier opinions.The hotel is looking worn and old and in desperate need of a makeover if it is to survive competition from the Four Seasons, JW Marriott and other five star brands appearing across the river in Pudong.Some particular disappointments: 1) the Internet LAN cable is too short to reach the bed, and WiFi is unavailable; 2) the shower head was old and rickety; 3) towels, although large in size, were quite rough on the skin; 4) amenities are generic and cheap; 5) staff was inattentive (nobody was in the lobby to take my suitcase at check-out, or to bring it to the taxi stand); 6) the very old television’s remote control did not work well, requiring me to jam my fingers into the buttons to change a channel.For leisure travelers, the hotel is not a suitable choice given its location and focus on business guests. For business travelers, consider the Four Seasons or JW Marriott as strong alternatives.Until the hotel completes a significant renovation, I would avoid this place and spend the money at a property with more value for cost. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Terrible This is not a nice hotel especially for a Ritz Carlton. I have stayed at multiple Ritz Carlton's worldwide and this has to be the worst. It is &quot;tired&quot; and needs major updating from everything from the Lobby to the rooms. Skip staying here and spend the money at the JW Marriott or the Four Seasons in Shanghai. This hotel needs a major renovation and until it has one I will not stay here again. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Gracious old hotel - a pleasant stay We were a bit stunned when we first arrived at the hotel... this is no standard Ritz Carlton. The hotel is huge and thus impersonal, i.e. lack of the signature of the personal touch at other Ritz Carlton. Language problem could post a barrier... although most of the service staff could speak some English, they would get lost if you try to get into details. However, they were snobbish enough to provide more attentive service to foreigners over &quot;locals&quot;. I am an Ethnic Chinese, and thus was always put at the end of the queue trying to get enquiry at the concierge. But other than that, I'd say the reception and concierge were still courteous enough. We stayed at a standard room and didn't find the room to be &quot;small&quot; as read here previously, but the furniture were indeed very dated. However, this &quot;antique-ness&quot; did disperse this feeling of the old Shanghai, just like a very gracious old lady. In fact, I did quite fall for the atmosphere after the first day.The only complaints of the room would be the dimly lit room (ok in the day time with the sun shining in) after the sun gone down; and the small bathroom which had a leakage in the toilet bowl (service was swift though... it was repaired during our short trip out to dine), and no separate shower cubicle.The gym was well equipped and opened 24 hours (I hope I remember right), and the swimming pool was of good size comparing to other hotels in Shanghai. There was even a mini-supermarket attached to the block which sold some good quility deli, but at a price of course!With its excellend location, this hotel is still on my list of choice hotels for my next trip to Shanghai. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Very Poor Service When we arrived at the hotel we were met outside our limousine and a man said he would take us up to our room. The room he took us to was not the room we had booked and not up to our standards. We were tired after a 24 hour trip so we spent the night in the room and the next morning I went down to complain and was offered a limousine ride to the airport. I refused and was told the room we had booked was not available. I told them they should have notified us that the room wasn't going to be available so we could go elsewhere. I should note that the reservation was made over six months in advance on their website. We were eventually moved to a higher floor but still not the correct room and offered a 10% discount WHOOPEE! Needless to say we won't be staying there again this year. So the message is if they meet you at the car it is bad news since they want to deal with you in the privacy of a room and not at the front desk. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,Can't wait to go back What service! I didn't want to leave. I recently stayed for 9 nights on a Club floor and enjoyed every single aspect of my stay. Can't wait to go back. Great staff. A special mention goes to Mr. Ralph Grippo the GM and also to Angela and Andy at the Club Lounge. 
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"Great for business people After reading other reviews I was a little concerned about staying here, but thankfully my fears were unfounded. Our business partners booked the room under their corporate rates and that helped. My one-bed room was plenty big and impecalby serviced. Nice touches like complementary bottled water replenished daily and ice delivered with turn-down were welcome. The staff was very helpful. Free coffee in the lobby each morning (until the handy Starbucks opened) suits my needs! Be sure to try the on-site Element Fresh for a nice, reasonably-priced breakfast and the Long Bar for a pre-dinner Guiness (buy-one-get-one during happy hour). Just across the street is a great typical restaurant with outdoor tables...not fancy, fairly crowded, very good food and prices as well as totally local crowd.This hotel offered everything I need for a business trip home base. "
portman ritz carlton shanghai ,"NOT REALLY A RITZ Very poor example of a Ritz Carlton. Staff is very nice and more than accomidating, yet the rooms and the facilites are VERY outdated and look more like a nice holiday inn then a ritz carlton. I didnt want to beleive the other reviews and try for myself, so I booked three nights at the Ritz. When I arrived and found my extra small club room, its a squeeze for 2 beds, I canceled my remaining days and booked at the hyatt.If you have stayed at other ritz carltons, come over and have a drink at the bar, but stay somewhere else, you will be dissapointed.In addition, the food and facilites on the club level are very poor. Nice room, but selection and quality of food are POOR. "

pudi boutique hotel ,"Mixed Feelings I am still here at the hotel and am checking out today. I have mixed feelings of this place. Positive: nice room decoration, large, well appointed room equipped with a printer, great bathroom, most staff friendly, good location for sightseeing or to Hongqiao/Gubei district, Chupa Chups at the reception (cute touch ;), nice view from the room if you are on the high floor, plenty of distilled water bottles in the room, etc...Well may be this has little to do with how comfortable the hotel is but the thing that disturbed me the most was the fact that we found few dead fish in the fish tanks on each floor EVRY DAY despite our attempts to correct the problem (we have written and called GM directly on two occasions). There are quite few fish tanks on each floor and they do add some flavor to the whole ambience of the hotel. However, if you find live fish feeding on the dead fish because they are so hungry right outside of your room, the whole desired effect is gone! This lack of attention to details equates to dirty toilet in a restaurant in my opinion. Imagine if you are at a posh restaurant. You find the food/service/atmosphere to your liking. Then you have to excuse yourself to go to the loo. And the toilet you find is a dirty mess! Also during our stay there was constant drilling and hammering noise from the construction site nearby and downstairs. We did not stay in the room the whole day so it was not too bad but despite the receptionist telling us all the construction stops at 6pm, some days it continued till 7pm. Most staff members are quite competent and friendly but I have found one girl (Ellen or Ely?) in the restaurant at 8th floor particularly unfriendly. Once my husband I went to have a breakfast there and although there was one other guest in the whole space, she told me to take a smaller table because she is expecting the place to be full. We did not follow her ‘instruction’ and took a bigger table for 4 by the window and from the beginning till the end of our breakfast, only two more guests arrived. She seemed angry the whole time we were there. What a nice way to begin a day! Next day at the breakfast I could not find a clean plate to put my food from the buffet so I asked the same girl, politely, ‘may I have a plate?’. She goes on with her chores without answering me so I said ‘excuse me?’ and she answered me with a very loud ‘YES (as in ‘I heard you!’). She also did not bring me the tea I asked for. As I mentioned, all other personnel I dealt with were polite and professional but it only takes only one person to destroy the whole experience in such a small establishment. Oh, and one last thing, we are in our late 30’s but sometimes we found the lighting in the room too dim. It would have been nice if we had a choice to dim it or brighten it. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Amazing Hotel Big Problems In 2008 I stayed at this hotel for 14 nights on three separate occasions. I keep going back, because it is quiet, well located, outstandingly designed with a wonderful attention to detail, the staff are friendly, helpful and very polite. The service is the best I have had anywhere. This is a truly wonderful boutique hotel. But you may be dissapointed.This boutique hotel reminds me of a very high performance italian sports car - a Lambourghini perhaps. Highly desirable, but you must put up with the problems.And there are definitely problems.Heating: The rooms are far too hot in winter and there is no way to cool them down as they only switch the air conditioning on during summer. And the windows open only a fraction. Noise: The hotel only has 8 floors so a bit of street noise excusable. However the famous nightclub on the ground floor makes a wild noise until 2.30am. When I had a room on the 5th floor my bed was shaking, the glass desk was vibrating and I could actually hear the DJ. When I moved to the 7th floor it was quiet. try and stay on the upper floors. The problem is that the hotel does not own the ground floor so they can do nothing about it. In October 2008 there was building work on the round floor. Jack hammers all day clearly heard from my room on the 7th floor.Plumbing: In all my visits I never managed to fill the uber-stylish bathtub. The water flow from the copper chrome taps was only a trickle. The massive tub looks amazing, so this is a real dissapointment.So why did I go back? Because it is just the most stylish, calming, discrete hotel I have stayed in with the best staff and a great location for doing business in Shanghai. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"what a disappointment. Dead fish in the fish tanks. Ground floor facilities closed due to refurbishment. Constant hammering and drilling noise during days. Hopeless service; no concierge; receptionist refused to help change flights with airline even though I couldn't do it as I don't speak chinese. Inflexible: breakfast only for one even though I made a booking for two. We stayed four days. I asked if we could have two breakfasts on two days of our stay. Hotel staff refused. Breakfast was meagre and a disappointment anyhow. Staff lacking knowledge and unhelpful regarding tours. Not a good hotel for leisure travelers. Only good thing about the hotel, was the studio room and the hotel's location in the old French area of Shanghai. If you want a truly great boutique hotel experience in China, go to The Opposite House in Beijing instead. Book a studio 70 room. Brilliant service - staff will bend over backwards to help. Great facilities. Great food. Architecture and interior design, unique. Our room felt like the interior of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Great Hotel As some other people have said it is not necessarily easy to find since the entrance is at the side. Also Cab drivers do not always drive right up to it becasue of the one way system which entails quite a long loop around the main roads to get to it. Hard to fault the hotel. Rooms are very nicely decorated and adequate size, though the shower drainage system which surrounds the toilet is a little strange. Very nice attentive staff, The air conditional in the common areas such as corridors and bar / restaurant at the top of the hotel, could be better. Make sure you do take advantage of the free happy hour drinks / snacks. Well worth while after a hot day of sightseeing. Otherwise the price of food and drink is quite expensive - for example about $6 US for a cup of coffee in the morning. The location of the hotel is great right next to Fuxing Park which has some great atmospheric sights at all times of day and it well within walking distance to restaurants and bars.All in all a great place to stay "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Once you find it it's a GREAT hotel. We arrived on a dark rainy night, and got a little frantic when we went to the front of the bldg &amp; all the signs said 'closed for remodeling'. You have to go around to the back of the bldg to find the entrance - and it is poorly lit, but don't get discouraged!The lobby is very small, dimly lit, but nice. But the room was great. Big, clean as a whistle, great air con, gorgeous huge bathroom, swell amenities. We booked on CTRIP and breakfast was NOT included with our rate. Be sure to ask when you're booking, cause it's pricey to add on. We ate there once - for convenience. Very quiet/small restaurant. We decided to go out on our own on the other days. We loved the location (we're walkers) - right next to FUXING Park. We'd go back in a heartbeat. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Perfect hotel in every way Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of a 2 week holiday in China. I thought the room was perfect: very spacious, enormous comfortable bed, immaculate bathroom with drenching shower and a free standing tub you could have a party in. Everything was beautifully and tastefully designed. it was perfect for relaxing after a day out. It was also very reasonably priced given the above. There was a restaurant but didn't eat there.I also found the location great. It is in the 'french concession' area which is littered with interesting bars, restaurants and shops. There seemed to be a nice mix of locals, tourists and ex-pats out and about. It is a short stroll from some major shopping streets, a slightly longer walk to the shanghai old town area and a cheap taxi ride to the Bund.For tourists wanting to discover the variety of shanghai I would say it is a much better option than the internationl high rise hotels that abound elsewhere. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Far exceeded my expectations with only a few negatives I come to Shanghai several times a year for business. I almost always have stayed on the Bund or in other popular areas with business travelers. Le Royal Meridien Shanghai was my most common default place for comparison.Pudi Boutique Hotel was suggested by a colleague who stayed here a month ago, so I decided to try it. I travel a lot and rarely am wowed by a hotel room. This one did it. I stayed in one of the &quot;Studio Rooms&quot; and it has a large and comfortable king-size bed, with a flat-screen TV easily viewable. The TV itself is part of a &quot;shelf&quot; that swivels 360 degrees, so that you can watch the TV from the large desk opposite the bed. The opposite side of the TV is a classy bar with nice glass ware.The sitting area is glass-enclosed; the bathroom has a large tub, a walk-in shower wet room with rain forest shower head; the dual-sinks and washing-up area are well stocked, and the toilet area has a built-in magazine rack. The closets are large enough for my week stay, and are accessible from both the bathroom and the hallway (the closets are built into the hallway/bathroom divider, and have doors on both sides).Free wired internet in the room with ethernet cable included. Free printer in the room (USB cable included). Free breakfast included - both in the restaurant AND for in-room dining. Free cocktail hour in the evening. Free gym with one treadmill, one bike, a large set of free weights, and a universal machine. I never had anyone else in there when I used it.The downsides are only negative if you aren't expecting them:- There is only one restaurant in the hotel and it's not often other people are there. The menu isn't huge, so if you're a picky eater, you may eat the same meal more than once if you eat there often.- The location isn't as fun as The Bund - there's not a lot around the hotel itself. I'm not too adventurous for food, so I didn't try any local restaurants. The area feels quite residential actually. I did discover that within walking distance there's a shopping mall and cinema (Transformers and Terminator playing at the moment in English), so maybe I just didn't explore the area enough. But you should expect to taxi when you want to go somewhere.I think I've found my new hotel for Shanghai. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"FRINDLY STAFF AND BUT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE Staff was very friendly , beautiful ...but staff lack of city knowledge and hotel knowledge "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Nice but sligthly overrated Nice room with a great bathroom (lovely big bath), helpful staff and good location, but we felt it didn't really live up to the great reviews below. Not a bad choice though. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"a truly luxurious boutique hotel It is not often that the hotel photos match reality but this did. Our suite was superbly comfortable and stunning to look at. The staff from our warm and friendly manager down to the young lady at the door were attentive and helpful. The position was ideal for exploring but still an oasis of calm.We cannot find anything to fault and recommend it to anyone especially, as we were told, &quot;if you want a soft landing&quot; for your first China experienceJenny and David Goldstein, Australia "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Pudi: great rooms and great staff! My partner and stayed in Pudi Boutique Hotel for three nights last week (until 21 September) in a deluxe room. It was the most luxurious hotel room we had in our week long stay in China. We especially liked the stereo system in the swiveling bar in our room. The glass-enclosed bathroom was very spacious. The shower a bit dark and the toiletries not as nice as elsewhere, but the provision of two types of bathrobes, crispy white sheets, complimentary bottled water and a handy kitchenette more than compensated.The entrance to the hotel is at the back of the building, but staff are standing on the lookout all the time to help first time visitors. The location next to Fuxing Park and close to the restaurants and shops in the French Concession makes it ideal. Taxi's and metro are cheap and easy. The hotel staff were very helpful, translating destinations for us so that we could communicate with taxi drivers. They staff speak English well.Facilities inlcude a small but well equipped gym. Pity that the buffet breakfast closes at 10.30 am even on a Sunday.Would recommend this hotel to adults, looking for a bit of luxury and tranquility away from the big chain hotels. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Truly excellent This is all you could want in a hotel. The website didn't give away much information so I was hesitant to book, but am so glad I did. Excellent location, extremely friendly and helpful staff and best of all, the rooms. They're excellent - spacious, kitted out with beautiful objects and artwork, lovely soft beds and those great thick hotel sheets, a window seat overlooking the park below, a huge and luxurious bathroom with separate deep oval bath, and the best robes. We wandered up to the hotel bar during happy hour and whilst we sat at the large windows overlooking the city lights, we sampled excellent wine and hors d'ouvres FOR FREE! After Pudi we went to Paris and stayed in a luxury hotel, and all we could think about was Pudi. My advice - don't hesitate, just book the Pudi. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Mom loved it After my mother announced to visit me in Shanghai, I really wanted to make it for her a very special experience. That fore I visited several hotels in Shanghai to find the very best. Finally I ended up with the decision for the Pudi Boutique Hotel Fuxing Park. Why? The style and the location of the hotel! The hotel is located right next to Fuxing Park at the crossing of Yandang Lu and Nanchang Lu. You can walk to Huaihai Lu within 5 minutes and reach Xintiandi by walk in less than 15 minutes.When you arrive at the crossing you maybe won't find the hotel very quick, because the entrance is a little bit hidden. But there arrived nice hotel employees open the door and welcome you in a very dark reception area. You feel more like in a club than in a hotel, this makes it very special. After a very short check of your passport your floor manager will guide you to your room, where you first proceed the in-room check-in which is done very quick by a single signature. After wards you will be introduced to all room functions and features.The rooms are really beautiful decorated with high-quality furniture on over 50 sqm. You feel like in a mix of art and furniture exhibition because of the very good condition of the rooms. In Shanghai you often find very hard beds which sometimes are not very comfortable for European backs. This hotel offers great soft beds and an extraordinary complimentary pillow menu. The bathroom offers plenty of space, a bathtub with massage function, a rain forest shower as well as two sinks. The desk offers a lot of space as well as complete office equipment and a printer.Other amenities of this hotel where the outstanding service and the roof terrace, which offers a stunning view over the French Concession area as well as a outdoor jacuzzi. Your floor manager is always reachable for you and gives his very best to have yourself a pleasant stay.The breakfast is served on the 8th floor. A small but fine buffet offers a choice of cereals, a lot of fruits, Swiss cheese and more... additionally you can order from their breakfast menu. I recommend the &quot;champagne scrambled eggs&quot; which makes your start of the day even more special. My mother finally stayed two nights at the Pudi in a Studio Room and really enjoyed her time there. She had never seen anything comparable to this hotel style and it's service before. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Perfect place in a perfect area We just returned from a 4 weeks trip in China, that was started by a 3 nights stay at the Pudi hotel in Shanghai, and that finished there too with one additional night.We loved the hotel for it's brilliant decoration and the kindness, competence and availability of the staff.The Pudi hotel has been rated by our kids &quot;best hotel in China&quot;! "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Terrific little place I gave this place 5/5 based on value for money.Stayed here for 2 nights in late January and chose this place because of trip advisor. I booked the room through sofitels website. If you book 15 days in advance you get a good discount, so I ended up paying about US$150.00.The staff were friendly and efficient and spoke surprisingly very good english. Other reviews at other hotels in Shanghai seem to complain about the level of english of staff.Room was grand with comfy bed, large new bathroom, and spotlessly clean. It was hard to fault. There are fish tanks all over the place. Groovy.Breakfast was delicious. The second morning I flew out early so asked for room service. Apparently the earliest you can get it is 6.30am. I nevertheless put down 6am on the form and it arrived at 6am!The only 2 minor issues I had here were that on a Saturday night there is a disco on the ground floor. A previous reviewer mentions this so I booked a quiet room and was put on the top floor. I could hardly hear the disco and it did not keep me awake. Secondly, the shower's plumbing was a little dodgy and water was leaking underneath the tiles. This reduced the pressure from the shower head which was ashame.Overall a terrific little hotel and I loved my stay here.GrahamAUSTRALIA "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Highly recommended We chose this new hotel based on reviews in tripadvisor and were not disappointed. The standard and size of the accommodation was superb for the base rate we paid, and the facilities in the room were far beyond that found in grander establishments. The friendly, helpful staff have been well trained by their new Dutch manager, who makes himself accessible to his guests. Any minor teething problems (some have been mentioned in earlier posts) are acknowledged and being resolved and should in no way discourage future travellers. This is not an hotel for backpackers on a tight budget or those chasing loyalty points in some faceless high-rise. Business travellers will be delighted with the office space, solo females with the level of security, and tourists with the haven of peace and quiet where staff address you by name. More than worth a visit. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Boutique through Great hotel, service attentive. Stayed in the junior suite so very spacious. good restaurants nearby. didn't eat in the rest. as only there for 4 nights! Good breakfasts. Loved the style and atmosphere. Manager there at breakfast time to say hello.booked through accor. asia website &amp; got a better deal than if booking with accor.com "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Close to perfect Pudi is very close to the perfect hotel. Reception staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, you're checked in by your own personal butler and given a quick tour of everything before being shown to your room. Rooms are large and lavishly appointed (in an understated and tasteful way, apart from the Dallas-esque bar). Beds are supremely comfortable, bathrooms feature jacuzzi baths and large rainforest showers and everything you might possibly want or need has been provided. Breakfast is impressive and the location is central. However, we had a couple of issues. One was the nightclub on the ground floor - we could hear music from it unitl 2.30am one night (and we were six floors above it). To be fair, staff offered to move us to another room when we rang to ask how long it would continue, but moving room's not really a solution at 1am, and obviously is only an option when the hotel's not full. Our other issue was that the room was extremely warm and the aircon had been set for hot air only. Our final issue was that the hotel hosted a fashion show one evening which meant that breakfast on that morning finished earlier than usual, and was uncomfortable because people from the show were standing over guests, hustling them out of the dining room which was to be set up for the show. Otherwise, top marks to Pudi. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Great find in great area in Shanghai Pudi Boutique Hotel is run by the Accor Hotel Group but it behaves like an exclusive boutique hotel. Stayed there for 3 nights and couldn't be more pleased. The hotel is brand new and the room was great- I especially liked the huge bathroom. Breakfast on the top floor of this 8 floor hotel is not to be missed-- try the vanilla french toast. Overall, a great experience in a great location in Shanghai. Close to the Dragonfly massage spa where we got foot massages each night! "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Cool and funky finding by Fuxing Perk I agree with all that the previous reviewer has to say about this small,comfortable and friendly hotel. Staff speak good English (which is not always the case in Chinese hotels).Rooms have all manner of gadgetry but are also comfortable, relaxing and user friendly. Great beds spacious bathrooms and free internet access. The business traveller will find the desk drawer full of office equipment and there is a printer/fax in all rooms. Atmospheric public area lighting is not always the brightest but soothing and restful.The top floor houses a restaurant, bar, meeting room, small gym and roof terrace. Good breakfasts are served by friendly and attentive staff.Situated within easy walking distance of Xintiandi where there are numerous restaurants and shops. Do find time to stroll around Fuxing Park particularly in the morning when hundreds of locals gather for exercises and social dancing.Only opened in June '07, rates are currently well below the published tariff (see [-]). This hotel is run by Accor Hotels but is not really a Sofitel despite appearing as such on the web site. "
pudi boutique hotel ,"Pudi is great for business or pleasure! Pudi Boutique hotel is a great choice in Shanghai! The website does it no justice, as this really is a gem of a hotel!It is a smaller boutique/design hotel, with around 50 rooms. The staff were very friendly, and very helpful in every possible way. The service is truly top notch.Pudi is located just next to Fuxing Park, in the French Concession. It's convenient location made walking out for dinner, drinks, and shopping very easy.The rooms are incredible in terms of decor. It was a successful marriage of modern, chic style and ammenities, with a predominately chinese feel. The entrance to each room has a large fish tank built into the wall, as well as an enormous tank in the lobby. Inside the rooms, an entire wall is windows, with a view of either the park or the street, with the blinds controlled by remote. The King bed is very comfortable, and we especially enjoyed the 'pillow menu,' where upon arriving you get to order which pillows you would like for your stay. The bathroom is stunning- a wet room for the shower, and the biggest stand along bath tub we have possibly ever seen. Rooms are divided in half, so to speak, with a tv in the center that is on a stand that swivels around. On one side is the bedroom part, and on the other a large desk with phone, fax, printer..., some chairs to relax in, and the other side is the bed.The top floor of Pudi is the restaurant, gym, bar, lounge, and outdoor terrace... again, all beautifully designed, very elegant, and with stellar service.The water in Shanghai is undrinkable, and the hotel is excellent at giving plenty of bottled water to guests. Everytime we returned to our room, there would be at least six new bottles of water.If travelling to Shanghai on either business if pleasure, Pudi is a great choice! "

pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Amazing hotel Stayed two nights on business. The hotel is amazing in all its aspects; location, staff, room, service, the F&amp;B. The price tag is pretty steep but at the end of the day you acknowledge that it' s value for money. Have not seen such a breakfast spread in any hotels so far.The European and local staff are eager to help the guests. The Jade bar at the 36th floor is out of the world with a view of the river front. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,5++ stars for Location and Service!! Views are amazing! Wow this place is amazing soon as you walk in the smell is like your in a flower garden. The entire staff goes above and beyond to greet and help you. Its a upper class place and they sure show it. I had complimentary tea brought to my room soon as I arrived. It was also the only place in shanghai that cashed my American express traveler checks. Its walking distance to most of the attractions. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great hotel Very good hotel. Excellent service, in-line with other Shangri-la's. Great location. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Incredible service and location Definitely the best hotel we stayed at in China. Despite the hotel’s size we always love the personal service we get at the Shangri-la and this hotel lived up to our expectations. Our reservations and special requests had all been attended to. We stayed in a Horizon Club Premier Bund room in the new tower which was exactly like the photo on the hotel website. A lovely big room with separate living area, dressing room and oversize bathroom. All the staff were very attentive and could not have done any more to improve our stay but we must give the Horizon Club (and Judy Leung in particular) a special mention. In the club you were always welcomed by name and the staff took the trouble to remember your favourite tipple, planned visits etc. Breakfast in the lounge was a great way to start the day. There was lots of choice from the buffet but the chef was happy to prepare any special requests. We ate lunch a couple of times at the Yi Cafe where there was a mind blowing selection of international food from ten open cooking stations. The quality and service was pretty good. We also ate at Jade on 36 (French fusion) and food and service was excellent. Our favourite meal was at T8 – a local modern style fusion restaurant recommended by Judy. There was something for everyone on the menu and the service was excellent I had the best steak I have ever tasted and my husband thought his blackened cod was outstanding. There were lots of local wine bars and restaurants nearby which we did not have time to try. 'Mr and Mrs Bund' was another recommendation. My only gripe from our stay is that there are only two internet stations in the club lounge which always seemed to be in use - not a huge problem as there are plenty of other computers is the main business centre. "

pudong shangri la shanghai ,"One of Life's Great Moments waking up with the whole of Shanghai at your feet To wake up with the Huang Po river, the Bund and the whole of Shanghai below you may be one of life's great highlights!We stayed here to experience the total eclipse of the sun on Wednesday 22nd July 2009 and stayed on for a few days. ( Check-out my YouTube record of the event: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX_zON85rw)This is one of the Great Hotels of the World in my opinion as I've been lucky enough to stay in quite a few top establishments over the years. We stayed in a sumptuous Horizon Club room on the 30th floor with the Bund just across the river. The view was magnificent and there was a pair of binoculars for our use in the room which we, of course, made good use of which added to our enjoyment. The room and bathroom were magnigficent. There was even a flat screen TV in the bathroom over the end of the tub.As with most Shangri-La hotels the accommodation and service were faultless. The food both at breakfast and dinner at the Yi Café was outstanding. It is an international culinary experience featuring 10 open-view kitchens and a lively cosmopolitan atmosphere. The walk-through design evokes a public market, with gourmet showcases and spectacular live cooking stations presenting cuisines from China, Japan, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East as well as Europe and North America. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"just ok thought the hotel was just ok. we stayed for 2 nights. granted we stayed in the old wing of the hotel, but still, we didn't think this hotel was any great shakes. i'd stay some where else next time. the staff though is very helpful. business center is excellent though. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent Great hotel overlooking the Pearl River and Bund.Quite pricey but worth it for the friendly staff, views and location.Stay in the Horizon Club tower as the older tower is showing its age.Great pool in the new tower. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Superb Hotel Along Huang Pu River! I LOVE this hotel. Everything about the hotel is just perfect. My first night was at the river view and I loved the view. I took alot of photos just from my window. The second to third night I transfered to the new building. The view wasnt that good bec of the construction at the moment but the room's amenities and bathroom are to die for. The location of the hotel is good. Beside is is Super Grand Mall. The subway station is a few blocks away. U can take the subway to Nan Jin Road.Since this is in China, tourists would have a difficult time conversing with the staffs of the hotel. Their primary language is Mandarin chinese. Although there are a handful of staffs that can speak English. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Incredible service and wonderful room We have just returned from a six night visit to this amazing hotel. We stayed in a Premier Bund view room in the newer grand tower and could not fault the room, fantastic layout with large desk, great lighting and views, beautiful furnishings and wonderful bed. The nightly turn down service is amazing with the staff incredibly friendly and respectful and quiet as they went about their nightly routine of turning down the bed, adjusting the curtains, refreshing the bathroom and leaving wonderful chocolates. We also chose the Horizon club room which gave us access to the lounge and nightly drinks and nibbles - incredible! In fact the food, from the awesome Y cafe breakfast buffet to the Horizon club and room service meals, along with Jade 36 were incredible. The food that comes out of this hotel is incredible and has to be seen to be believed - the bakery items, the smoked fish, the chocolates all amazing!! Again, the service cannot be faulted from the Austrian manager of the breakfast buffet who made sure our every need was met and remembered to the conceige staff who recommended a wonderful Hot pot restuarant near his home out in the suburbs - everyone was wonderful.We also used the well equiped gym and could not fault it. Yes it is true it is at times difficult to get to the Puxi side with cabs as there is a great deal of development going on due to the world fair 2010 so the best option is to take the Metro over to the Puxi side and if necessary cab from there but to be honest the metro system is clean and easy for the non-Chinese speaker to handle.The Shangri-La is like an oasis of calm amougst the chaotic charm of Shanghai - yes, I would stay there again in an instant - Class!Oh, it is not cheap but if money is not a major concern I think it is wonderful and the Horizon Club benefits worth it as they are generous and not at all tight. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Wonderful A perfect business hotel - perfect service, room, food, great gym, nice pool, good location. Definitely my favourite in Shanghai so far... "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent hotel exemplary service"" In Pudong this is one of the really outstanding hotels. I would have given it an even higher rate but for a few small gripes. I would recommend the river tower and not the new tower for the views. The view i had was not great as it was over Pudong which is still undergoing frenetic development. for Shanghai Expo 2010. Having said that the room was good, and had a good bathroom and was well appointed, and had alll the nioce little extras. Some of the sockets did not work ,but as it was the last day i did not bother complaining. The staff were superb, really friendly and abundant in number. The limo service to and from the airports was efficient and effective. The hotel has a range of good restaurants, fitness facilities, swimming pools and bars. it even has an on-site tailor and travel agent. You cannot fault the service it is really good. it is slightly pricey but it is a top end product and it is worth it. Everything works well with this hotel, and for a businessman or tourist alike you will have a good experience. I did earwig and overheard some staff discussing a complaint they had recieved, and judging from their reaction they took it really seriously. They were not aware of my presence so i know they meant it. If you want to go to Pudong and stay there...definitely check it out. If you want to stay on the bund side it is a bit of a hike ,and you have to go through the tunnel, but taxi's are so ridiculously cheap you would never ever walk. Just remember when in China to bring directions/addresses in Chinese script to and from the hotel. The staff will help you out. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Very good business hotel Stayed in the hotel for a week. Service was efficient and friendly at all times, food was consistently good (if not outstanding) in all the restaurants/cafes (especially the Chinese in the lobby area) and the room/amenities were excellent. Would certainly recommend for similar trip "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent Business Hotel Organized a week long business meeting on-sit in May 2008, very comfortable hotel. Excellent buffet at restaurants. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Service not as good as in the past I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 3 years. It is a great hotel for business. Service has always been excellent, except for this last trip. I had an issue with my room rate in that it differed from the rate offered over the internet. I asked an attendant at the front desk to explain my rate. While he tried to explain the rate, he was not very professional and first gave me some excuses as to why my rate was higher than what was offered over the internet. He eventually adjusted the rate, but it was not a pleasant experience and very different from my previous stays. I would still recommend this hotel, but I would carefully watch the rate that is being charged. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Maximum points for the best staff! I had a great pleasure to stay at the Grand Tower Horizon Club room(wonderful rooms!) of this fantastic hotel for six days.I can honestly tell You that nowhere have I met such a hospitality andsuch a wilingness to be of service than in this spectacular hotel.Not a single member of the staff I met ( I probably met over 100 staff members) deserves less than maximum points for good service! 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"The Best Hotel My husband had a conference here and I came along for some sightseeing. First off I have to comment on Shanghai. If you expect a typical Chinese city this place is not for you. You could place Shanghai in any major city around the world. It is modern and very business oriented. The Pudong section is where all the business hotels are located. Across the river is a more touristy and local area.I loved everything about this hotel except the difficuly traveling across the river but I will get to that later.The rooms in this hotel are, by far, the largest of any I have stayed in. We happened to be staying in a suite with seperate bedroom in order for my husbandd to conduct meetings in private. The views are spectacular especially on clear mornings. I did visit some other rooms of collegues and customers and they also were very large. The bedding is to die for and extremely comfortable. The bathrooms are sparkling clean and well maintained.The staff is very accomodating in every way from check in to check out. All of the rooms our group reserved were supposed to be non-smoaking. One happened to be smoking but when we brought this to management attention no other rooms were available due to the convention. They immediatly apologized and sent in a cleaning crew to shampoo carpets, drapes and replace the entire bedding. Afterwards there was no trace of smoke in the room. All this was done quickly, quietly and in a most professional manner.Since this was for business, we ate most dinners in the hotel. The best place was the Yi Cafe. It is a buffet but on a scale not seen before. It is pricy if you are having breakfast there but if on a club floor (as we were) your breakfast is included in the club. For dinner the cafe has multiple stations of international and local food. Top notch all around.The only disadvantage is the location across from all the tourist sites. You can take a taxi for practically no money but be prepared to sit in traffic. The best way to cross the river is by tourist tram - a very Disney type ride in a tram car that goes through the tunnel with flahing lights and out of body music. Fun for kids and adults and about $4 roundtrip. The most efficient and cheapest is taking the Metro. Very easy to navigate and ticket machines have info in English. The station is just across the street and only a stop or 2 for the main tourist spots.All in all the best 5 star hotel I have stayed in. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Awsome Hotel! From The view of a 13 year old.Our stay here at the Shangri la hotel in shanghai was sensational. I am part of a family of 4 children and we stayed here for 5 nights while celebrating our friends 40th birthday. We had two bund view rooms on the 20th floor and we were part of the horizon club. The views were magnificent although the older building kind of obscured the view. The rooms were massive. One of our rooms was slightly larger than the other because it was in the corner but even our normal rooms was very spacious. A large glass panel stretched the length of the room and the curtains were control from the side of your bed. The bed was very comfortable and the TV had a wide range of channel including my favorite (discovery). The bathtub was big and so was the shower. A wide range of complimentary toiletries were also provided. The wardrobe was big enough to fit by brothers, my sisters and my clothes with space to spare. Our parent’s room was larger with a wood sliding door that separated the bedroom and the living room which was good when at night time they could close it to keep it quiet for my younger sister when she slept. The horizon club was amazing. I took my two sisters up there every morning to let my parents sleep and the food was good. For breakfast they offered pastries, cereal with fresh milk, bacon, sausages, Asian breakfast (noodles and fried rice etc.), fruit, muffins, toast, tea, coffee and more. Breakfast was from 7:00 to 10:00 I think then from 10:00 to 5:30 it was just chips and apples then from 5:30 – 9:00 hot dinner was available. I am not sure exactly but Judy, who I think was in charge of the horizon club was amazing. She is Canadian and she got my sisters and me everything that we needed. Although I never visited the pool at the hotel everybody else said it was good. My mum went down to the gym every day and she said that she loved it. The horizon Club also had two computers that you could use for the internet free of charge. They also had a printer which they said they charged for but I printed lots of stuff walked in front of staff members with it in my hand and never got caught. Overall the Shangri La Shanghai was awesome. [--] "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,luxury get pampered in this luxury hotel....offering guests luxury accommodation alongside warm hospitality 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Location is worth the money- great spot! We are very happy with our decision to stay at the Shangri-la at Pudong. We were here for 4 nights which is plenty of time to see area sights.The newer tower (Grand) has nicer rooms and doesn't smell 'old' compared to the older River tower and we were upgraded when we arrived along with the breakfast buffet for 350RMB per day. (note: be sure you clarify the total amount, because they always add a 15 percent service charge onto everything but don't quote that in the price verbally) The buffet at Yi Cafe is very good as past reviewers have stated. I love the location for viewing and strolling by the river and it is right by the Pear TV Tower which is the most recognizable building on the Shanghai skyline (Jetson's cartoon looking structure with the 3 spheres). The other side is all under construction for the expo- so not so good over there right now. The hotel staff are very pleasant- smile, greet and open the doors and tell you to enjoy your day at every turn. English still can sometimes be a bit of a barrier in communication, but you just need to be a little patient and try to find another person. Taxi drivers do not understand English very well but do seem to recognize the Shangri-la name so I think that is a benefit to staying here as well. Taxi's are pretty cheap so it is not a big deal to get over to the other side of the river to do site seeing. I recommend People's Park/Square with the Yu Yuan Garden. There are a ton of touristy shops in that area and the traditional chinese garden is nice as well. Walk down to the Bund along Nanjing Rd. to see all the people and all high end shops. We also did a 1 hour river cruise at night which was enjoyable. Went to the aquarium, which is quite good and not talked about much! The Shanghai World Financial Center building I also can't believe is not more talked about. It is currently the tallest building in the world that has an observation deck on the 100th floor- look it up at swfc-shanghai.com. Much better view than the Pearl TV tower or Jing Mao building I think. Last thing I want to mention is that the hotel is also right by the Super Brand Mall which obviously has a lot of shopping if you'd like to do that, but please stop there to try the xia long bao dumplings with the soup inside at the restaurant on the 3rd floor called Ding Tai Feng- they are excellent, this is a world renowned restaurant too and it is not expensive. Oops almost forgot to mention the Jade 36 bar (and restaurant) the bar -has a must see view!Enjoy the sights! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"5 Star Prices however not nearly up to scratch We stayed at the Shangri-La Pudong as a part of our honeymoon. This hotel was expensive - we stayed in a Tower Wing Executive room foolishly thinking we may get a half decent view. The hotel itself is very nice, the rooms are luxurious and clean and lobby areas beautiful as you would expect for the brand and price. One note however is that the leading photo on the website, of the lobby looking over the city skyline is complete fiction. The lobby is indeed very impressive however unless you want to mount a ladder to have your afternoon tea as photographer obviously did to take that photo you will only see trees and the tops of a few buildings. We arrived later in the evening, and after paying our taxi driver, I left my wife with our bags at the front of the hotel while I ventured inside to try and locate someone vaguely resembling a hotel employee that may possibly be able to help with our luggage and possibly even (stretching it) welcome us to their fine establishment. Just as I was wondering if Shangri-La were going to re-paint their hotel orange and call themselves and easy-hotel I managed to find a doorman inside at the far end of the lobby and soon after he finished his important conversation with his mate he was able to help. Three cheers for five star service. We had a few days earlier stayed in a Valley Wing Deluxe room at the Shangri-La Singapore for a about USD 20 more than this room cost, and wow what a difference - its hard to imagine this is the same hotel company.At check in we were told that seeing it was our honeymoon I may want to pay for one of several great upgrades they had on offer - fantastic - thanks but no thanks. This basically summed the place up when it comes to their staff - cavalier, uninterested, and inept. We found that of the four different concierges we spoke to for advice, one knew vaguely anything about the city in which they were working. French Concession, Jade Buda, ferry wharfs etc etc - apparently in Shanghai all these sites regularly change location hence confusing the Shangri-La concierges.We did find the gym to be very nice. The restaurant &quot;Jade on 36&quot; having received rave reviews has just changed their head-chef. We were told that the restaurant had just been re-opened a week ago. Obviously the recently departed chef was he who had earned their reputation as the food was good however not what it should have been for a) the price, and b) the reputation and reviews (obviously all based on the last guy). The views were amazing of course and I would recommend going there for these however don't get any ideas of it comparing in any way to the equivalent in price on the other side of the river or in HK, Singapore etc. Jade on 36 is a half decent attempt at fine dining with amazing views, and waiters who are still coming to grips with the food that they are serving and almost grasping the concept that red and white wines differ in some way.Summary - If your on a business trip then I think this hotel would probably do OK (albeit poor value for money) however for anything else don't bother at all.

pudong shangri la shanghai ,Terrible Smell of Fumes in the River Wing I stayed two days at the River Wing of this property for F1. It's a hell. The smell of fumes from renovated floors was so strong that I could not breathe. But I was told the hotel was full booked and they could not change room for me. Suggest to avoid this hotel now. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Breakfast One of the World's BEST Cant really describe the breakfast - for most it would be called a full spread brunch buffet. Simply the best in F&amp;B and the rooms were also great minus the water temperature control that needed to be adjusted several times during a shower. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Best hotel we have ever stayed in Stayed at this hotel for three nights an the end of a two week sightseeing tour of China, and I have to say, we saved the best till last. This hotel is wonderful. I had booked a deluxe room, but when we arrived I found out that it had a city view, rather than a view over the river. We decided to upgrade to a room in the Grand Tower which overlooked the river and the Bund. Looking on the Shangri-la website, I am almost certain that the room we were allocated was a Horizon Premier Bund View room and it was gorgeous. It cost us an extra 550RMB per night, but that included one breakfast in the Yi Cafe each day, which was not in our original room rate and that accounted for about half the cost of the upgrade, so we thought it was well worth it, if for the view alone!The amenities in the room were superb. It had everything, nothing at all was overlooked.The breakfast in the Yi Cafe is fantastic. About ten food stations featuring different cuisines. We ate late each morning, and found we didn't need to each again until the evening (cheapskates that we are). We dined here one evening and again it was lovely, a buffet featuring Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Western, anything you can think of really.There was a drinks package for 'freeflow drinks' which included beer and wine for I think 128RMB per person each meal. which was good value as the drinks kept coming. For comparison, nearly every bottle of wine on the list was in excess of £30, so as people who like their wine this was a good option for us as we probably had a couple of beers and three or four glasses of wine each.What really sets this hotel apart though is the level of service. There must I think, be more staff than customers, there is always someone to open a door for you, call a lift for you, give you directions, and everyone without exception is courteous and goes out of their way to acknowledge you. We have stopped in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this without a doubt was the best.A couple of tips, take a river cruise at night, to get great views of both The Bund and Pudong district. And visit the ERA Acrobatic show if time allows, very entertaining.Also take a ride on the Maglev train (world's fastest passenger train) which runs from Pudong International Airport to Longyang Lu Metro Station in Pudong. This is a 30km trip and takes just 8 minutes. A great way to get from Pudong to the Airport if you have no transfer booked.The only disappointment in Shanghai was that they are hosting Expo 2010 which starts on 1st May and at the moment there is a lot of restoration work being undertaken on the Bund. I am sure it will be lovely when completed next year, but at the moment that area is filthy, dusty and chaotic. If you want to see Shanghai at it's best, I would wait until May next year, if you cannot wait stay on the Pudong side of the river, I would highly recommend the Shangri-La!! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Exceptional Service Even by the standards of the best hotels in Asia, the Shangri La in Pudong stands apart. with service levels of the highest standard, especially for frequent guests. A breakfast waiter remembered my preference for decaff cappuccinos two months after a previous visit!Stay in a room overlooking the Bund on the 28th-30th floors. The Horizon Club is a well-equipped and well-run executive lounge on the 29th floor sthat erves an entirely adequate breakfast and cocktails late afternoon. Horizon Club guests can reserve (for free) a small conference room in the Club. Floors 28 and 30 are connected to the Club by staircases.The hotel fitness center is fine and the pool is good, not great. Unusually, there is a good quality outdoor tennis court (with night lighting) on the 5th level, accessible from the fitness club.There is a diverse set of restaurants, Chinese, seafood, sushi, western but the high quality buffet in the second floor Yi cafe is one of the best values in Shanghai.

pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Declining customer service-Pudong Shangri-La This is my 4th stay at the Shangri-la as of Jan 2009. I found the service has declined, not living up to the Shangri-La brand standard. In previous visits, I am often met at the car (I used hotel limo to travel to and from the airport) by a receptionist and taken directly to my room for check in. This year, I can't even get a bellman to take my luggage at the door. At my last visit, the receptionist told me that it is not possible that I am a repeat guest ( she said in perfect English &quot;I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE&quot;.) She then proceeded to advice me not to stay in the River Wing because of the &quot;renovations&quot; are noisy. She suggested that I take a room in the new wing - for 350 RMB more. I told her that I prefer the River Wing as I like the view of the River and the Bund. She then gave me a room that (to my horrors ) stared directly into what appears to be kitchens of restaurants in the Lotus Mall with lots of sweaty cooks. Since this visit was short, I closed the drapes and remind myself that I can vote with my feet by choosing another 5 start property in the Pudong area. But I found her tactic totally distasteful (bait and switch did not work so she selected a room next to the elevator and with a view most appalling to a woman traveler). My Shanri-La Golden Circle profile specifies HIGH Floor, AWAY from elevator, and view of the River. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Flawless from A to Z That was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Shangri La is definitely working hard to please. Outstanding food, restaurants, decor, etc. The accomodation rate as well as the price of the room service was OK for the quality I was getting.I got a room in the new wing and it was amazing to look out of the window every morning, watch the sunrise, the flowing traffic and China being built in front of my eyes.Top recommendation. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Up to Shangri La high standards My first visit here staying in the wing closest to the river with great views of the river and The Bund and Pudong skyscrapers. In a well appointed room in good working order complete with binoculars. Its true the TVs are slightly old but the room is an elegant Shangri Las standard. Dinner and breakfast buffet at the Cafe is extensive requiring almost a jog around the various food kitchens. This is the largest area for such a kitchen set up I have seen. Sleek design coupled with contemporary and classical public areas gives a feeling of warmth. The staff were generally very good and experienced which shows through. Of course I will go again. I doubt the experience can be bettered. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Beautiful Hotel I stayed in this hotel for four nights whilst doing business in Shanghai.It is ideally placed for a number of malls and restuarants.I would find it very hard to find fault with this hotel.Anything I had to eat in the hotel was very tasty.My room was large and I had a great view.It was also cleaned on a daily basis.The only thing I found frustrating was the cost as the British £ was starting to go in freefall when I was in China 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"(too) huge breakfast I chose to stay at the Pundong Shangri-La for its location, handy when you come from the aiport. I had a river-facing room in the old wing; as expected the vista on Puxi (directly from my bed - see the pic) was great. I did expect a little bit more from the accomodation itself - the room was not that big, and the furnishing a bit too classic for my taste (the rooms in the new wing seem to be bigger and more modern).The breakfast buffet was one of the biggest I've ever seen - maybe it was even too big (is that possible?!) and confusing. As a Golden Circle member (their loyalty program), I got breakfast for half price, making it a good deal.Service was perfect as one would expect from a Shangri-La. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Excellent does not begin to discribe this hotel! We have traveled the world and this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"High Quality but Pricey For me this was a case of 'you get what you pay for'. I stayed in the new wing of the hotel and the room was extremely comfortable, very well equipped and had a superb ensuite bathroom. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have seen - a fantastic array of Westerm, Chinese and Japanese food. However, like everything else in this hotel, it didn't come cheap.There were a good range of bars and restaurants some of which had spectacular views of the Bund.The staff were helpful and efficient but slightly impersonnal. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Location and Great Hotel We were picked up by the hotel from the airport. Was fast and efficient. When we arrived we were greeted by one of the senior hotel managers and shown to the check in counter and then to the room by the same person which is a nice touch that makes you feel special. We actually changed to one of the rooms in the new wing and when we walked in the room we were amazed at the size of it. The window overlooks the river and has a floor to ceiling window which is great. Electric drapes and a comfy bed, the room was fantastic. I can't really think of a fault which is unusual for me. The service was great, but the best part was the spa, I normally splash out on massages because of my stressful job, it was one of the best ones I have had, up there with the Venetian Macau and was technically perfect. Definitely will stay again at the ShangriLa Shanghai and I am not even a Shangri La fan! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"An oasis in Shanghai This is the first time I've given a hotel 5 stars on trip advisor and I've written quite a few reviews. Although I am a westerner living in Shanghai, my husband and I decided to spend a romantic night away at one of the city's 5 star hotels. We were so happy we chose the Shangri La. From the minute we walked in, our stress disappeared. Everyone of the staff speaks perfect english (a rarity in China- some places may say they speak english but these guys really did). Our check in was quick and effecient and our room- a club level premier room- was HUGE. We stayed in the new wing (Grand Tower) which I would recommend for everyone. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were comfortable. What made the stay so pleasant was the excellent service from everyone, their positive attitude, and their wllingness to accomodate. I'd also highly recommend club level which gives you a higher floor (away from the noise of Shanghai traffic) and access to the Horizon Club which includes buffet breakfast. The breakfast was pretty good- a mix of chinese and western, and lots of fresh fruit and juices. The location is also ideal for exploring many of Shanghai's tourist sights and is directly across from a huge mall with decent shopping and restaraunts. Also conveniently located in relation to the subway which can get you pretty much anywhere in Shanghai. Overall, a lovely place to stay and we can't wait to find an excuse to go back. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"ASK FOR THE RENOVATED WINGTHE OLD ONE IS TIRED I was awoken in the night by the smell of fumes in my room as the renovations above ruptured a pipe thus causing a leak(I'm a fit 31 year old but was left gasping for breath) consequently i was moved in the middle of the night from my room to another wing in the hotel ( hotel has two towers).It was only then i realised how this hotel was a story of two experiences as my new room was brand new and stunning whilst the old one was pretty average and dated.So if you dont get the new wing stay in another hotel like the st regis,which is good.Otherwise i found the hotel to be very good,but on the very large side thus lacking character. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"A great hotel We stayed for 4 days at the Pudong Shangri-La and had a wonderful experience. Upon arrival we upgraded to the new (1 or 2 years old) Grand Tower instead of the River Wing. The River Wing is closer to the river, but we had a river view from our room that was nearly unobstructed. The room was huge with a large sitting area and every possible amenity. Service was excellent. The hotel has a huge staff (for example, one or sometimes even two people just to hold the door to the elevator on the lobby level and one or two to open the doors when arrive or depart). The River Wing and the Grand Tower are connected at the lobby level and the second level where many restaurants are located, so it's easy to use restaurants and facilities in the whole hotel. We ate in two Chinese restaurants in the hotel and both were good, but not great; however, not too pricey for hotel restaurants. We found it best to take taxis to and from most Shanghai locations from the hotel. There's a lot of construction in Shanghai at the moment, so it's dusty and sometimes difficult to navigate certain areas on foot. Taxis are very reasonably priced and ubiquitous. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Stay Very pleased with Pudong Shangri-La.1-Jade on 36 has a fantastic bar with amazing Bund views.2-The River Wing rooms, albeit the old tower, was tastefully decorated and disimilar to other ultra-modern hotels like minimalistic Westin rooms.3-In-room Internet connection was very quick.4-Rooms were thoroughly cleaned, clothing was unexpectedly folded, receipts were stacked together and not thrown away.5-Concierge staff were very knowledgeable and managed to arrange some great reservations for dinner.After the chaotic treks back and forth from the F1 track in Jia Ding, staying at Pudong Shangri-La was a truly relaxing experience. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"One of the best rooms I've stayed in On arrival I was offered an upgrade to the executive floor, as this included breakfast etc I accepted. The room was very large and the bathroom as good as any I have seen.The full-height windows offer stunning views of Pudong, the Bund and beyond, and it is ideally located for shopping in the Mall next door, site seeing up a choice of towers, and popping over to the Bund via the excruciatingly awful but somehow wonderful Tourist Tunnel. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"loved the Shangri-la in Shanghai We stayed at the Pudong Shangri-la for 3 nights as part of the National Day Holiday week in China. Our room was on the 32nd floor of the Grand Tower, overlooking the river on the bund. The attention to detail in the hotel and our room was superb, and a real oasis given the chaos that was Shanghai during the public holiday. We ate breakfast each morning in the Yi Cafe which served a very good buffet, and also at e a buffet dinner there one night - plenty of choices available. My husband went to the Chi Spa twice during our stay and thoroughly enjoyed a Himalayan bath and massage. The gym was small but well equipped. Our package included return airport transfers, unlimited laundry, free internet access and breakfast. We had access to the executive floor lounge which had a happy hour for 2 hours each afternoon - including drinks and a range of snacks and canapes. Highly recommended hotel in Shanghai, right next door to the Super Brand Mall. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"How a business hotel should be This is how a business hotel should be. Very close to the convention center and a small shopping mall. Service is excellent, all business related amenities are available.As going around in Shanghai is quite a challenge in terms of communication, the hotel staff are very attentive in providing information to assist in getting taxi rides, etc. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Magnificent Shangri-La! But..... The Shangri-la Pudong is one of the top 5-star hotels in fast growing urban Shanghai. Strategically located in the Pudong business district among a sea of office buildings and opposite the riverbank offering great views of the famous Shanghai Bund. ArrivingMy room package ( call by Shangri-La as “Value Rate” ) includes among many benefits; round trip airport limousine transfer, complimentary breakfast, internet and laundry. The new Shanghai Pudong airport Terminal 2 is massive, and just getting from the airbridge to the immigration counters took 20 mins by foot. Upon exiting from the customs, a hotel staff was on standby to greet me and escort me to my limousine car, a brand new Audi A6. Also provided in the car were cool towels and mineral waters. I had a most enjoyable 40 mins ride to the hotel listening to my own CD thru the car’s excellent audio sound system and also chatting with my limousine driver. Upon arrival at the hotel, a nice lady was on standby to greet me and handle the check-in formalities speedily. I was escorted to my room in no time. The RoomThe Shangri-La has two wings, two separate buildings actually connected by a pathway. The “old” Shangri-La River Wing features rooms with classical décor and and most have direct views of the Bund. The newer Grand Tower Wing features modern contemporary rooms with just a light touch of oriental ascent. I booked the standard room in the Grand Tower which they called “Executive Room”. The Room definitely has a high “wow” factor and is much better looking in actual compared to the pictures on the hotel’s website. It’s feels new, luxurious and refreshing. Every part of the room’s wall is covered with either exotic wallpapers or luxurious panels made from very high quality veneer wood. Well designed lighting effects give the room a lot of cheerfulness while maintaining the overall luxurious feel. The room design is also highly intelligent. Segregate clearly into “zones”, there is a ultra spacious working desk ( which also can double as a vanity area ), a comfy sofa chair by the window, build in wall closet. Floor to ceiling windows offers magnificent view of the Pudong skyscrapers and unlike many hotel rooms, it’s not obstructed by any bulky furniture. There’s a construction site visible from the window but it wasn’t noisy at all. In fact, I think I prefer this view over the more expensive Bund View rooms. The room feels very spacious because it’s a corner room and also the design of the room makes it feel spacious, despite the room being only about 40m2. The bathroom is all marble and glass, with dual light modes, dual sinks, tub and a separate shower cubicle with rainforest overhead shower. It’s a full ensuite and also feel spacious too. There’s also a LCD TV above the bathtub. Toiletries are L’Occitane ( imported, not China made ). Water pressure could do with some improvement though. I’m not sure why but almost all the hotels I stayed in China have to me inadequate water pressure. Room amenities are lacking in nothing. There’s a Philips rotating 32” LCD TV with a DVD player and also wireless in-room internet connection. A spacious electronic safe is included in the closet area and of course, minibar with free coffee/tea. The bed is ultra-comfortable, one of the best I have slept in and featured luxurious 200+ thread count linens. The hotel is obviously very confident about the quality of their beds that they are actually selling the pillows and bedsheets. Overall, everything about this hotel room is very high class, evident from the décor to the furnishing to the design. This is the best hotel room I have stayed in China, far exceeding the other two 5-star hotels that I have stayed before, ie the Le Meridien or Eton hotel in Shanghai. Only the top-of-the-line hotels in Hong Kong and Tokyo have better rooms. Common Areas The common areas of Shangri-la are very luxurious. The hotel owner obviously spared no expenses in decorating this hotel to the max. There’s good “flow” from one area to another. The Grand Tower lobby features high ceiling and veneer wood panels, glass and magnificent crystal chandeliers decorating every corner. The style is a mix of classic and contemporary. I took a peek at some of the restaurants in the hotel and they are all very posh looking with a price-tag to match. I did not have the chance to try out any of the restaurants though except the morning breakfast which was included in my room rate. I also took a peek at the Horizon Club Lounge and was impressed by the cozy atmosphere and great views of both Bund and Pudong area. It’s very spacious and posh. In retrospect, I should probably have booked the Horizon floor. ServiceThe Shangri-la Pudong manage to impress with consistently good service standards throughout my stay. It shows that the staff were all very well trained by the management. An added advantage is that most staff seems to speak much better English compared to other hotels in China that I have stayed in. They have a sincerity to serve and yet have nothing of the “snottiness’ that are quite common among some of the hotel staff in China’s hotels. LocationThe Shangri-La Pudong is located in Pudong financial district, great if you are there for business, but not so great if you are there for sight seeing as besides being connected to a mall, there isn’t nothing much within walking distance for tourist. The other side at Puxi will be more interesting. Getting around in Shanghai could be a hassle nowadays with traffic jam so it’s important to take this into account when considering the hotel for it’s location. The big “BUT”…… At last, nothing is perfect. An almost perfect stay was spoiled by the sub-par quality of the breakfast served at the Yi Café. I have been looking forward to this buffet as I heard so much about the Shangri-la breakfast being the “best in town”. While the variety and selection was impressive, the quality was not. The bread taste rather stale, like leftover bread, the orange juice was bitter and the eggs were not correctly done. It’s very run of the mill. Most of the oriental selections are cooked too oily. And there’s a strong smell of oil permeating the café which was rather unpleasant. The food was by no means unedible, just not of the quality I expected. Also, an incident on improperly washed vegetables caused me much embarrassment when inviting my colleague to join me for breakfast one morning. Although the managers of the café apologize profusely and waived the breakfast charges, still it should never have happened in the first place.This was unfortunate as I observed that the café staff was attentive and tried their best to provide good service to the guests. However, the food quality was really a let down here esp when other parts of the hotel were universally excellent. Perhaps my expectation had been unnaturally high because I heard so much about the “out of the world” and the best in Shanghai which turned out to be very disappointing. ConclusionI had wondered aloud to myself what to give the Pudong Shangri-La, ie a great but short of excellent 4/5 or the perfect 5/5. Without a doubt, this is hands down the best and most luxurious Shangri-la hotel that I have stayed in, which is not saying much because the other Shangri-las I have experienced are frankly rather mediocre. However, this hotel is also the best hotel I have stayed so far in China. It stops short of perfection by the sub-par breakfast, but that does not distract it from other areas which are all excellent. Overall, a wonderful hotel but still short of greatness. So it’s still a 4/5 hotel but it’s very very close to 5/5. I will definitely want to return to this hotel again in future, maybe to try their Horizon Rooms this time. Perhaps in a future stay, if everything is fine, I would be able to revise my rating to 5/5. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Best Breakfast we have ever seen This hotel was great. First, it was the best smelling hotel we have ever smelled. It's not something we notice usually, but we did here. Now to the breakfast -- get it! It is the nicest breakfast, with so many Western and Chinese options, you won't believe it. We were on a tour with a lot of seasoned travelers, and even they admitted that it was the best they had seen. Book it, you won't regret it ... the Pudong area is up and coming ... but most of the tourist stuff is in the other end of the city. The cabs are dirt cheap though, so it shouldn't bother you much. Overall, a great stay. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"First Class All The Way I stayed at the Shangri-La in Pudong, Shanghai for a night on business. I with I could have stayed longer (both for the city and the hotel). This is a first class operation all the way around.My room was huge (an associate arranged for an upgrade) with a view of the river and parts of the classic Shanghai skyline. The workspace was great, and though the wireless didn't work well for me the alternative lan line did the trick. Service is something I'm told is inconsistent in China. Not the case here - from the minute I walked in I was given as much attention as I needed, from taking me to my room to picking up my suit for pressing (and getting it back 2 hours early). There are 2 towers at the Shangri-La, the Grand and the River. I was in the River Tower, which I mention because I was able to use the newly renovated health club. It was spacious, lots of equipment, a great lap pool for swimmers.The cafe for breakfast was a bit of overkill - too many choices. But they were all good. I did get a few eye rolls as I asked for my second and third cups of coffee, but I was told later that it was cultural (and being in need of the caffeine I ignored them).The only downside is location - if your meetings are not in Pudong it can be a long, slow drive across the city. But with proper planning you can work around that. Or you just deal with it. Nonetheless I will stay here next time in Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Exceptional Hotel with Impeccable Service I travel often in Asia, but this is the first time I have stayed with the Shangri-La. They completely exceeded and surpassed all expectations with attention to every detail imaginable. Per conditions of our reservation, we were upgraded to the Horizon Club and the amenities included simply floweth!We were picked up promptly at the airport and upon arrival, greeted by the smiling staff and quickly whisked to our spotless, spacious and beautifully decorated room. The bellhop promptly delivered our bags and we unpacked our belongings in a very organized and plentiful shelved closet. We found the large bathroom with double sinks convienent, stocked aplenty with fresh towels and every thoughtful amenity imaginable (nail clippers, razor &amp; lotion, sewing kit, hair band, vanity care items, toothbrush &amp; paste, etc.) as well as a L'Occitane bath and lotion products. The shower, bathtub and separated toliet area were immaculate and the flatscreen tv over the tub was fabulous for relaxing and watching some tellie. All fixtures and furniture are contemporary, but the interior decor harmonizes well with the spectacular Bund view for a refreshing, exciting, and ultimately very comfortable feel. We stayed a week and we felt like we were at home the entire time. The bed was big, comfy and abounding with pillows. Flat screen tv situated between bed and sitting area was accompanied with an easy-to-use dvd player. The room was equipped with wi-fi and internet connection cord, several telephones (as well as a cordless), fax machine and cabinet and fridge stocked with tons of munchies and drinks. The buffet on the 29th floor had plenty of Chinese and American styled foods. One can order personalized omelettes, eggs, drinks, etc. as desired and they are prepared quickly. Liquid fanatics will love their selection of 8 morning juices, coffee and tea selections. The International buffet was delicious with authentic Chinese specialty dishes, and their Japanese food was fresh with very efficient service. Their is a bar on the top floor that offers spectacular views, and the same goes for their amazing feature restaurant, Jade on 36, with innovative gourmet so exquisitely presented- definitely a must try for a once in a life time food experience. Room service was immediate and delectable.Every taxi in the city knows the hotel so getting back from any location, regardless of how far I traversed, was not a problem. Just a short walk away was the Grand Mall with endless shopping opportunities, and the river was just a few steps away, with food/coffee shops and benches to sit and enjoy the scenery. More than once, I left substancial amounts of cash out (via cleaning purse of reciepts before heading out) and nothing was ever touched or missing. I don't suggest you do it, but from my experience, I have never felt safer with my personal items.Overall, I highly recommend anyone who can afford the hotel to stay here. I am sold as a loyal customer and cannot wait for my next trip back, where I will stay here again and again...A heartfelt thanks to Angel and Stella for insuring the stay to be a slice of refined and gratifying luxury often marketed now, but rarely delivered. This Shangri-La is certainly a jewel hotel. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"A really great hotel - if you want to stay in Pudong I stayed here for a week at a conference in one of the newly decorated room.Not a cheap hotel, but it was really excellent with terrific service. The bars, pools, gyms were excellent. The breakfast was one of the most amazing I have ever had - nothing missing, I mean nothing.Only down side is the sterility of Pudong. Stayed in Puxi for a few days before, which was much more real China hustle and bustle around peoples square - that is the side to be on if you wish to not have to travel across the river all the time. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Hotel - Run by Bad Practice Con Men Hi Everyone, I have left a while between arriving back to UK and writing my review, to allow me to settle to enable me to write a more honest and not a hot headed review.Initially I will tell you that we booked the hotel for our trip to the Special Olympics World Games, as I am a wheelchair user I wanted a hotel that advertised adapted accessable rooms, as we were staying for 13 nights and I was sharing with my son, who has learning disabilities and wanted to be reassured I would be able to manage myself. The full package, hotel flights and transfers, were booked via Thomsons in the UK, and 8 people all booked together - 2 x triple rooms and 1 x twin accesable.On arrival at the hotel, we were impressed with the beautiful design, the cool refreshing air conditioning, and wow the beautiful smell! It was a moment of wow on all the senses.At check in, the young lady took our names, and booked us in quite efficiantly and then handed over a range of keys to one of the men in the party, not making clear which of the rooms were triples or which was the accessable room, when I eventually managed to get her attention to ask her which room was mine she told me that they no longer have accessable rooms as people in wheelchairs do not visit China - Hello, I was sitting in my wheelchair and had emailed the hotel on several occasssions prior to us travelling to remind them about my request for the accessable room. The receptionist then just walked off, whilest I was in mid sentence to her.At this point, remebering we had travelled via Dubai and had been traveling for approx 24 hours now, we requested to speak to some of authority who could inform me how I was to manage in a room I could not even get my wheelchair into, through the door.Eventually, after a bit of explaining, the assistant manager came out and explained that the hotel was having a revamp in some of its rooms, and the accessable ones were under repair, that they were not being done away with, but just being upgraded but out of use for my stay. He negotiated with my friend and they then decided that a suite, being bigger, would accomodate me, and my chair better, so we were upgraded to the new tower and I was given a suite; this was lovely, spacious, bright and overlooked the bund, but I still had 2 little problems. 1) that the wheelchair could not get into the bathroom and 2) that my friend, who I was travelling with, were on another floor and around the corner from the lift, so if I needed help, it was quite a way for me to get to them or visca versa. Eventually, they were also moved up onto the 6th floor, with me and given rooms the same as mine, so although it took another 2 hours we did manage to stay together and on day 2 a joiner was sent to remove the offending roor - enabling me to get into the toilet with my chair.The initial room was nice, but this new room was fantastic!During our stay, we used the restaurants in the hotel quite often, the young people in our party loved the sweets available from the Yi Cafe, which became our most popular 'in house' venue because of the range of food available at every sitting, 10 open kitchens each offering a vast array of cuisine from throughout the world, and the most exquisit of delicate little deserts , of which you could choose as many, or as few as you liked. The chocolate fountain was also a favorite.The bar on 36 is a must, a beautiful view, surrounding are great and drinks are delicious and some variations on traditional cocktails with a delicate oriental twist; delicious. Cost was no more than at other restaurants or bars either.We had high tea in the lounge, which worked out a very reasonable option, but they do only have so many, so you need to get in early before they all go.We also had room service on a couple of nights, the first one after the opening ceremony took about 45 minutes to deliver (they had told us 20 mins when we ordered) they appologised profoundly when they delivered it and gave it us for free!On the second occasion, we half hoped that it would be late - but it arrived on time and was again delicous.The cakes at Gourmet, are delicous, and at 7pm are reduced to half price - well worth the visit for a supper snack!The pool is a nice bright area, and when we were ther we only ever saw one other couple. The jaccuzzi is briliant, however if you are travelling as a couple it would be dissappointing, as there is one in the ladies changing rooms and one in the mens - no comunal jaccuzi. Luckily I was travelling with three other women and their husbands minded my son, so we had a lovely time in there. It became a daily routine, after getting back from the games. In the changing rooms, there were chaise lounges a proper dressing room, with moisturisers, talcum powder, q tips etc, and the a lounge area with ginger tea - foc, and a nice relaxing area to get yourself reacclimatised to life after a wonderfully relaxing expeariance. Whilest we were there, there was 1 day when the jaccuzzi did not work, but the water was still lovely and warm and relaxing, it was fixed by the next day.The pool/jaccuzzi area is down about 3 steps and then up another couple to get in to the jaccuzzi - luckily there are always staff around to help, but sometimes you have to actually ask them to help. From the initial disturbance at check in, things had gone swimmingly and we had such a wonderful stay at the Shangri La, the next dissappointment came at check out when we were informed we needed to pay for our stay, as Thomsons had not paid them, and that previously they had not paid for stays made by other people, so we were to pay and then claim the money we had paid back from Thomson; We thought it may have been an error caused by the upgraded room, so got Mr Andy - as he had became known to us, to clarify the situation. He told us that it was correct, Thomsons had not paid them, that they were indeed not charging for the upgrade that was complimentry as they did not have the rooms I had booked, but that he would not charge us for the room again, but requested we chase their payment up from Thomons on our return.On our return, Thomson said payment to the hotel had been made, and we emailed this info to Mr Andy, who promptly debited my friends credit card for the cost of all 3 rooms! After approx 4 months, Thomsons eventually paid up - and my friends card was re-embursed. Thomsons have since offered him compensation - but not actually paid it!!All in all, a lovely hotel, fantastic service in the hotel, a bad time outside of the hotel if you have a disability, but if you do go from the UK please,please, please, dont use Thomsons!!

pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Missed Opportunity I just got back from our trip to China, in which we stayed at the Shangri La for seven days - April 13 to April 20, 2008. Prior to leaving for this adventure, I had read the prior reviews and, as a result, could not wait to get to Shanghai. Needless to say, the Shangri La missed a golden opportunity to add to its already long list of rave reviews (please see my review of the Moevenpick in Amsterdam).I had three major problems. First, they do not offer free wireless internet in the old tower rooms. For a business traveler needing to communicate effectively and constantly with their company back in the US, it is not 21st century service to require your guests to sign-up everyday for ethernet connections. Yes, it was only $18 US per day, but still.... Second, the carpeting in the room is in serious need of replacement. Third, and most problematic, was the noxious smell that permeated the old tower for several days. One day it was so bad that my wife and I thought we had mistakenly signed up for a reality TV show that required us to stay and live in an oil refinery - it was so bad one night that we had to turn off our air conditioning system because the fumes were making us nauseous.I would like to commend and recommend the staff of the hotel, however. Everyone I interacted with at every level of the organization was top notch in my book. It is only because of them that I can give an overall neutral evaluation of the Shangri La. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Nice 5 stars hotel Very good 5 stars hotel in Pudong, Shangahi, with a outstandings views of the Bund. It is very easy to go everywhere in Shangahi, because the subways is just one block away.The rooms are wide and with warm decorations, and all the amenities needed. Bathrooms are wide enough .There are many restaurants and a beautiful lobby.Staff is very friendly and helpfull. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"great location We have just arrived back from China. We spent 3 nights in beijing, 2 nights in xian and the last 3 nights in Shanghai.Although we had the most amazing room, the largest ever! (we upgraded to a horizon room, which I had not done before)However, i am not sure why but was not left with that wow factor that I have got from other Shangri La hotels.The hotel was very large, but also a little impersonal. We still had a great time there and would recommend it. We were just a little spoit in Beijing. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Solid performer - not outstanding but good. I stayed here at the recommendation of colleagues in Asia. I had business nearby in Pudong so it made sense. Car from and to airport was prompt (600 RMBs each way) and comfortable. Room was OK - sufficient size for one business traveler. I made use of room service for some western sandwiches a few nights - very good and reasonable. I ate breakfast at Starbucks right around the corner and overlooking the river. I had a drink in the bar one night - OK. I did not use the fitness center or pool or restaurants. I bought a disposable camera in the gift shop because I forgot my digital - the camera must have been way past shelf life as all the pictures came out dark. Taxis were very convenient . If you are doing business in Pudong this is a centrally located hotel. I don't want to sound overly critical - because all in all - it not a bad choice. I would stay here again. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Hotel loved the location Great location on Pudong waterfront, opposite The Bund and fabulous views from Jade Restaurant on 36th floor are quite unbelievable. Spacious and immaculate room in North Tower, excellent room service at a reasonable price but the dreaded Evian water in room hit a new high of 101 yuan ( with service, equivalent to £7 !!! ) for 0.75 litres, about 25 times the cost of purified water on the street ( to be fair they do give you a couple of bottles of the cheaper stuff each day).Highly trained and friendly staff, outstanding 10 kitchen Yi restaurant does a fine buffet ( Chinese is good too), so no complaints.......our best hotel of 5 in China and well worth its 5 star rating. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Good business hotel Stayed here for a conference in March. Had a standard room in the new tower - very spacious, good size bathroom etc. Rooms with numbers ending 60, 61, or 62 are larger (with a tv in the bathroom) and have better views (onto the Bund) than any of the ones ending in 50-something (which look onto the Jinmao tower and the IFC building site - quite noisy). Ate in the hotel a few times. The Chinese restaurant on the ground floor (Gui Hua Lou) is alright, food was fine, but service was really patchy - loads of mix ups with drinks, and some dishes took forever to arrive. The Yi Cafe on the first floor has a massive breakfast and lunch buffet - avoid lunch on the weekend if you can. I turned up on Sunday and the place was packed with little children running all over the place and congregating around the pudding/dessert area. Had tea in the lobby lounge in the new tower - nothing special. Poor selection, and very smoky. Ordered room service - arrived promptly every time. The gym and pool in the new wing are pretty good - reasonable selection of free weights, but not too many cardio machines. Used the business centre a few times. It's good - you get your own semi-private open office area, but costs a fortune - printing is RMB10 per sheet and internet access is something like RMB150 per 15 minutes. Easiest way to get to the Bund from the hotel is to take the Tourist Tunnel - really tacky and silly, but fun. The shopping mall next to the hotel has a couple of good places to eat if you get bored of staying inside - a Western pasta/smoothie place on the ground floor, and a branch of the Ding Tai Feng dumpling chain on one of the higher floors. Overall, a good hotel if you're here for work, but probably not right for a leisure traveller. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Disappointed in the Shang Stayed here 1 night then checked out and into Eton Hotel. 3000 RMB a night for a smallish room which needs a bit of a refurb is over the top in my opinion especially when u can get 2 nights at the Eton with better rooms for the equivalent price including brfast and cocktails on the exec floor.I stayed in the newer wing in the Shang for a week a year ago and this is head and shoulders above the older wing. My advice, insist on a room in the newer wing or else save your money and go to the Eton instead. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Nice hotel The Shangri la was decent enough hotel for the 280 a night cost...I would say with all things being equal I would stay at the Hyatt for the same cost 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great View and Location! We were nervous about staying in Pudong because we weren't sure how easy it would be to get across the river, but it turned out that we were happy with our decision to stay at the Shangri-La. Our room had a stunning view of the Bund, which when lit up at night is beautiful. We could also see all of the river activity perfectly. It is easy to get across the river. You can take a taxi, a public ferry (easy to understand), or this thing called the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel. The tunnel is a tourist attraction and not a serious transportation method, but it is cool to see and definitely a fun way to get across the river at least once. It consists of small glass-walled pods that run on a track. The track goes from one end of the tunnel to the other, and you ride along in your pod watching a lightshow that changes from tunnel segment to tunnel segment, and hearing music and narration. Kids love it, and we adults enjoyed it too. It's fun, but too pricey to be your normal way across the river. In any event, both the tunnel and the ferry are within easy walking distance from the hotel.There is world class dining within easy distance of the hotel, and once you are across the river it is easy to get on the subway and go wherever you want.Our room was perfectly set up to take advantage of the incredible view. The longest wall was made up of floor-to-ceiling windows, which the bed faced. There was also a sitting area in which the sofa faced out. The closet was spacious and nicely appointed with dark woods and cupboard lights that turned on and off when you opened and closed the door.The bathroom was pristine and large enough for two people to use easily. The bath products were Aigner and all nice.The lobby atmosphere was very elegant, with tall women in long red dresses standing by the doors to open them for people. The front desk staff were all attired perfectly as well, with red jackets and flowered skirts for the women (I'm sorry I didn't notice what the men were wearing). These were not your everyday hotel uniforms--they looked like something I would wear to a party.The check-in process was very smooth. We were met at the door by one of the beautifully dressed red jacket women, and she took us up to our room and conducted the entire check-in there. No standing at a desk at the Shangri-La. This was especially nice as we had just gotten off a long flight and were eager to get settled and regroup a little bit.Breakfast in the Shangri-La was great! They had a buffet of Chinese, Japanese, and Western breakfast foods that spread throughout several rooms. There were dumplings galore, a miso soup station, eggs to order, several different kinds of smoked fish, charcuterie, pastries, a smoothie station, salads, granola... you name it. The breakfast was not cheap, but it was delicious and filling, and a great experience to boot.The concierges were gracious and helpful, making several dinner reservations for us and also arranging tours.I would absolutely stay here again if I were to return to Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Wonderful I was lucky enough to be in a room overlooking the Bund which meant that the TV did not go on once. But what really makes this hotel special is the service. Food is absolutley excellent, from the Sushi place to the Chinese restaurant. And the beds are so so comfortable. Nice little touches with everything at the Shangri-la from lots of chocs when you order drinks to lovely soaps in the bathrooms and very helpful staff. Oh what joy if the British hotel industry learnt from the Asians and Americans...doubtful "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Best Room in Shanghai Corner Suite in New Tower Stayed in 3 hotels while in Shanghai- Radisson New World, Shangrila Pudong, and JW Marriott. The best hotel experience by far was at the Shangrila Pudong! As a member of golden circle, upgraded for a discount to the Horizon Club Corner Suite....it was absolutely AMAZING! Had a direct view of the Bund from the living room and spectacular view from bedroom and bathrooms as well. Stayed at the Peninsula Bangkok with a view of the river before and THIS blows it away! The view of the Bund, especially at night, is mesmerizing. Horizon Club was well worth the extra for the excellent food and service. Will return to this hotel in a heartbeat even though expensive. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Superb views over the bund The views from this hotel can't be beaten! The river front location on the Pudong side of the Huangpu means you can see the hustle and bustle of the river traffic right from your window. It's amazing watching all manner of boats that almost seem like they're half sinking making their way with all sorts of strange cargo.The rooms in the old wing are closer to the river, which is where we stayed. However, this does mean that the decor and furnishings are a little bit dated but still very good, in line with what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.The restaurant in the hotel is fantastic and I had one of the best dinners in the Jade restaurant. The fusion cuisine is presented in a very innovative manner, ranging from sashimi served looking like tulips to duck-l'orange served looking like a bacon and egg breakfast plate (the duck was cut and cooked to look like bacon, and you could swear that the curdled orange sauce looked like an egg yolk especially when you poke it and it flows). Amazing! However, it literally did cost 1/2 a (local average person's) year's salary!The only (very slight) downside with staying here is that you would have to take the trains or taxis to get to the main tourist attractions on the other side of the river as you can't walk across - there's no bridges nearby, only vehicular tunnels. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Classy Shangri-la Booked this hotel from our travel agent and got a really good rate ($150/night) for both Christmas Eve and New Year (separately). We got to stay in the old tower. Even though it was named the 'old' tower, the room itself was in a good condition decorated with classic style. The room was quite spacious, beds are fine, housekeeping was quick and friendly. Breakfast was perfect ranging from Chinese to Indian food, from Continental to American breakfast, and they also provide juices and smoothies. You couldn't hope for more! Minor thing was we lost a small doll, but we reckoned it wasn't because it was stolen but probably got washed away with our bedsheets. We did visit the Spa, and even thought it was of high quality, the price was just too expensive. Overall was a qood experience. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Doesn't lose its charm Stayed here during a conference - in the old tower. Great service. Very helpful staff, particularly concierge who helped me find a good pearls shop in the basement of the science centre and wrote the directions in chinese for the taxi driver. Always remember guide books are out of date once printed so check with local staff! Conference facilities fine and food good. Certainly go back. Make sure you eat in the French Concession area of Shanghai and have a massage at Spa on the BUnd. the ferry across the river is great too and soooo cheap. Sam from London "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Superb Experience Stayed in the original tower with side view of river. Room was large,immaculate throughout and was very comfortable as you would expect. We could not find anything bad to say about this Shangri la hotel, yes it is a large hotel but you know that before you go, all of the staff were very polite and it felt genuine as well. The breakfast buffet was one of the most spectacular we have seen and although not cheap was of very high quality.The hotel is situated right on the river which is a great location with fab views across to the bund especially from the roof top bar 36 storeys up at night. Great hotel in great position and would most certainly stay again if in Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Loved it!!!!!!!! FAB HOTEL!!!!! Wow!! Great hotel, wonderful staff, they liturally could not do enough for you, I've stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and the Shangri-La, Shanghai is really up there with my favourites. One point I would make is on booking ask to stay in the NEW TOWER!!! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Very disappointing The hotel staff's English was quite limited and they didn't seem very helpful towards me. There was no need to insert your room key to reach the room floors, which bothered me a fair bit since this is a very busy part of Shanghai, and it was disturbing to know that anyone can access any floor. The room was VERY DIRTY. There was black dust all over every surface and the floor looked like it needed a good vacumming. I checked out the very next day and do not ever intend to go back. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Jade 36 The hotel is wonderful; however the crowning jewel is the exquisite dining experience of Jade 36. It is hard to imagine a more creative, elegant and memorable dining experience. Do not miss this unique restaurant; no matter where you have been, there is nothing that compares to this. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent hotel in a great spot Using the outstanding Maglev train link to get from Pudong International Airport, and a cab from the station to the hotel, we pulled up at the hotel and the place immediately felt familiar. The lobby area of the hotel is reminiscent of a top Las Vegas strip hotel, in its size and slightly vulgar opulence. Some Tripadvisor reviews had warned of over-enthusiastic staff, pushing upgrades on you, but we didn't experience this. We had requested a Premier room in Tower 2, and were very please with it. The speedy lifts/elevators took us up to our extremely high room (floor 34, I think), and we made our way into the large and attractive room. Pulling back the electrically-operated curtains and nets, we had a view of Pudong, which wasn't ideal, but that's what we paid for. The vast amount of construction taking place in the hotel's immediate surroundings meant almost constant noise, but it was OK at night. We were also so far up that the noise wasn't overly-intrusive; just a background noise of pneumatic hammers and piledrivers. This may get worse as the buildings reach higher into the sky (they were still at ground level when we were there.Housekeeping at the hotel was marvellous, and in-room dining very pleasant. There is a supermarket in the basement of the shopping centre next door to the hotel, so you can stock up on drinks and snacks, and put them in the mini-bar. The safe was large enough to contain a 15&quot; laptop and various other gadgets and valuables, and the bathroom was luxurious and large (2 basins, separate shower cubicle with waterfall shower head, flat-screen TV at the end of the bath).The room itself was very comfortable, with comfortable beds, welcome air-conditioning (Shanghai was incredibly hot while we were there) large television, desk, floor-to-ceiling windows, some comfortable seating and ample wardrobe space. Disappointingly, internet access was chargeable, but we found it useful.We enjoyed the bar (Jade on 36) a couple of floors up, though found the drink prices to be a bit steep. It's not a long walk to go over to the Jin Mao building and admire an even loftier view from the bar at the top of the Hyatt hotel. A 5 minute walk in the other direction takes you to the river, where you get a view of the Bund. There are also a few bars/restaurants and a Hagen Daazs outlet by the river. We used a number of transport options from the hotel; taxis are very inexpensive, if a bit &quot;exciting&quot;. The very efficient tube/metro system can be accessed from the station across the road (and slightly round the corner) from the hotel, and the hilarious Bund Sight-seeing tunnel is a short walk from the hotel. This last means of transport isn't the best value, but it is quite funny, and it gets you to the Bund. We liked being on the Pudong side of the river, and transport was so straightforward and cheap, that nothing was stopping us from going back and forth when we wanted to go shopping or sightseeing on the old-town side.During our stay, we were very happy with the hotel, the staff were most helpful, and we would certainly consider staying there again, if we were to return to Shanghai. The only thing stopping us would be the constantly changing selection of hotels, which will doubtless provide the Shangri-La with a challenge to keep up with ever-increasing standards. Right now, however, they've got to be up there with the best in town. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Very good A great hotel. Excellent rooms. Good service with English speakers on every desk. A very reasonable price when compared to similar hotels worldwide.Would thoroughly recommend staying here. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"The best of the best in Shanghai! One of the best hotel in the world. Good location, friendly, clean, and beautiful. High quality food, beverages, and staff. Have been coming here for years, and will not go to any other hotel in Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Loved the Shangri-La The Shangri-La was awesome! I stayed here twice on business and thoroughly enjoyed both visits. The location is great (I could even walk to work) and I especially enjoyed the Blue Frog and Super Brand Mall. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to Shanghai and staying on the Pudong side of the river. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Superb Shangri-La Pudong Shangri-La is superb, typical Shangri-La rooms, comfortable and the Bund view is fantastic. Food, as always in Shangri-La hotels is excellent, although breakfast is very busy around 8 am, I assume due to lots of business customers.The only downside is that they used DCC on my credit card on checkout, fortunately I spotted it and got them to reverse it and charge me in Yuan. (DCC Direct Currency Conversion is a scam whereby the bank converts your bill to your local currency at an unfavourable rate). The hotel has told me they will make sure that in future they always ask before using DCC. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great place to stay I have stayed at this hotel before and continue to enjoy my experience at the hotel (and the various chains). This time round I believe I stayed in the newer tower (tower 1, which I believe is a bit cheaper). Location isn't probably the most convenient but it is Shanghai and taking a cab or the subway is your best way to get around anyways. You are close to the Bund , the Pearl Tower as well as the Grand Hyatt (I'm guessing a 10-15 minute walk at most). Rooms (Executive room - single) are a good size with modern furnishings and a very nice design. Definitely, a lot bigger than what you would get in HK. Amentities are-a-plenty. Lounge bar, night bar, excellent buffet lunch, decent sized gym (cardio equipment has personal tv's built-in with headphones) etc. I stayed at the Grand Hyatt a few days later and if you ignore the Hyatt's over the top glamour and glitz (don't get me wrong, it is very nice and impressive!) I think you get better value with the Shangri-La. However, if you can expense it, then go for the Hyatt (and check out its bar at the top of the hotel - 88th floor, I believe). "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Hotel Amazing Buffet The hotel has an excellent location and a beautiful lobby with gorgeous garden views. The rooms are very nice. The service at this hotel was absolutely stellar all around: all restaurant staff, check-in, concierge, bellman, cleaning staff, you name it. The breakfast buffet is the most amazing breakfast buffet display I have ever seen anywhere in the world! I was sad that I did not have time to do a lunch there. It was an international feast fit for any nationality: American, German, French, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Not only was there an amazing display of food variety, but the presentation was so beautiful! The lobby with gorgeous garden views is a great spot to have a drink or afternoon tea. I can't say enough good things about the Shangri La in Shanghai!!!! =) I dream of going back! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"best location in Shanghai over looking the Bund This hotel is one of the best 5 * hotels I have stayed in and in my opinion has the best location in Shanghai over looking the Bund and is especially good at night when the lights illuminate all the buildings and they have laser shows. We had a superior room on the 16th floor of the original tower so after an exhausting day we could lay in bed and have a free light show. Its also 4 minute walk from a big shopping mall with many clothes shops and restaurants ( I would recommend the Hongye great food and a menu in English) and 10 minuets from the Oriental Pearl Tower ( the T V tower) a landmark of Shanghai. The check in was excellent with friendly courteous staff . The bedroom was a good size and well decorated with large a comfortable king size bed and a choice of 5 pillows contour, polyester, feather, herbal or buckwheat. The usual slippers, bath robe, tea/coffee facilities, ironing board &amp; iron and a rechargeable torch and smoke masks. YI café served an extensive range of high quality food for breakfast. It could take you 4 minuets to walk around every counter to see the choices from English/ American to Asian and Chinese. They have a great health club on level 4 open 5.30am-11pm with running machines looking out over the Bund and city and also a tennis court, swimming pool , sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi. The hotel has some shops and a business centre. The staff were very courteous and friendly and I will certainly return to stay here on my next visit to Shanghai "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Fab hotel with great rooms overlooking the Bund A fab hotel with great rooms overlooking the Bund. My wife and I stayed here as part of a private tour of many cities in China.We used Shangri-la hotels in all five locations and were very satisfied overall. This hotel was one of the two best we experienced. The hotel has a wonderful sense of arrival, a super overall ambiance throughout the public areas and wery friendly, efficient and attentive professional employees.Our room overlooking the bund added to our enjoyment. The only downside was the initial smell smoking caused by previous occupants despite it being a non-smoking room. Housekeeping did their best to remove it and overall the housekeeping standard was excellent.There are a number of excellent restaurants and Breakfast was amaizing. The 36th floor bar was spectacular, next time we will use the Restaurant on that floor.They did get the bill wrong on check out and I am in discussion to have it corrected..... be careful to check your credit card statement after your departure. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"My collegues My collegues were so glad this hotel ended up back on our &quot;approved hotels&quot; list at work. It is a fabulous hotel with a great location. As this was my first trip to Asia, I was really overwhelmed at the great service and beautiful furnishings of the hotelLike another reviewer, I was also pleasantly surprised at how quickly I was checked in and in my room. The service at the hotel was really great. I stayed at this hotel for 2 consecutive weekends, in two different towers. The first weekend I stayed in the old tower on the 22nd floor where I had a fabulous view of the hotel gardens &amp; pool and the Pearl Tower. Because I had internet access in my room, I rigged up my webcam and was able to show my boyfriend a real-time view of the tower. That was really amazing. The room was beautiful with marble floors and shower in the bathroom. I also upgraded so the room included internet and breakfast in the tower lounge. That was definitely worth it since the lounge was quiet and intimate with a great view.The next weekend I stayed in the new tower. The room was much more modern and sleek, with electronically controlled curtains and lighting. The bathroom door was interesting since it was curved and slid along a rail. The room view was not as nice though - a construction site. This room was quite a bit more than I paid in the old tower, and it did not have the view and did not include breakfast or internet. It was nice to try both towers, but I think I'd stay in the old one next time. (I think the room may have been larger in the old tower, too)I didn't try the basement restaurant. I went to the buffet one between the two towers and it was fantastic! The food was to die for and there was something for everyone: traditional asian chinese or vietnamese, seafood, mediterrean food, western food and desserts that you just had to try. There are several kitchen stations with staff there to help you with your selections. Nothing I ate disappointed me. If I end up back in Shanghai, I will definitely eat there again,The location of the hotel was perfect. It was across from the Bund so you had a great view of it but were away from the crowd. I never took a cab in Shanghai (except to get to the airport or out of town), so I took the pedistrian tunnel across. It's such an easy way to get to the other side. If you don't want to go that far, there is a fantastic mall right next to the hotel with tons of shops and restaurants. Overall I was really pleased with my stay and would definitely stay there again. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Good Hotel Great Food....but could have been better ! Let the title of the review not bother you. This is a good property, excellent location, courteous staff with reasonably good knowledge of English (its important in Shanghai), fabulous service.The BIG Positives for this Hotel are :1. Location - Very well connected to underground rail, taxis are available, the great shanghai bund and tower are across the road, shopping areas can be reached in 10-12 min. and at 15-20 Yuan by taxi or 3 Yuan by train.2. Food - Yi Cafe offers decent vegetarian spread. Italian, Indian, Lebanese, Japnese etc. cuisine options3. Service- Staff &amp; Service deserve a mention. Check-in/out was express.Things that could be Improved :1. BATS - A nightclub in the basement which allows &quot;women&quot; to solicit customers. One would not expect &quot;Shangrila&quot; brand to allow such business officially within its premises.2. Rooms - While rooms are well maintained and have all necessary amenities the overall ambience in rooms &amp; lobby needs some attention to further improve the hotel rating. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Good facilities and location... I stayed in the Pudong Shangrila for 4 nights as part of a business trip. First of all, I was very concerned about food being a vegetarian, I imagined that it would be tough to get along but the hotel had a very good veggie spread in its buffet. Rooms were very comfortable and well tuned to a business traveller. Jade at 36 has a fantastic view and the basement pub BATS is quite ok (not great) but has some good singers. Staff is very courteous and rooms are maintained very well. Overall, was a good stay and was conducive to checking out the main sights in the city as they were not far away by cab.ps: The restaurants in the hotel shut down really early like around 930 pm so for late nighters like myself it is quite a problem! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Good but not excellent I stayed at the Shangrila for 6 nights. First, the negatives - I stayed at the grand tower and the rooms were good but nothing special. They were kind of small and lacked the normal Asian hospitality that you get to see in other Asian countries. No fruits in the room, no DVD player, the AC refused to go below 24 degrees C, the TV volume was capped at a certain level and at times made it hard to hear certain channels. Mind you, a DVD player becomes very useful when you are staying for a long time and especially since 90% of the channels are in Chinese. The bathrooms too were standard. The carpet in the room needed a wash in few spots. The hotel has a disco in the ground floor - BATS. The music and the ambience was great but the place seemed to be filled with &quot;friendly girls&quot; (if you know what I mean) who keep approaching you every 10 minutes. This really spoilt the fun of sitting with a drink and simply enjoying the music. Now to the positives, and there are quite a few - The check-in process was the fastest I have seen ever. The attendant escorted me directly from the car to the room. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. The food at the hotel is simply great. The location is perfect with a huge mall beside and right across the bund. The hotel is very well connected to the metro and other transportation. Its probably the best location in Shanghai. The bar on the 26th floor has an awesome view and not to be missed at all. If you are lucky, you may get a room with a direct view of the bund. All in all, the experience was good, but I have been to better hotels in Asia. So, this place is not part of my best 3 hotels in Asia. This place is worth a stay though, simply because of its fantastic location to everything. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Lovely experience A few days after my five day stay at the Shangri La Pudong, I met a few Canadian businessmen in Hong Kong. When talking about Shanghai, I mentioned having stayed at the Shangri La. As I was on there on my employer's expenses, they commented: &quot;Wow, your boss takes really good care of you!&quot; And that indeed sums up the experience. From being received by the hotel's deputy manager (and finding a handwritten letter in my room by the manager, apologising for not having received us), to the view from one of their cool bars &quot;Jade on 36&quot;; excellent.Staying on the 18th floor with a fantastic view on the Bund, I must admit the room was not really my style, but still very clean and comfortable. It's just that I'm not a marble and decorative wallpaper kind of guy. And you'd expect to find big flatscreens in such rooms but hey, Chinese tv is crap anyway.Everything else was just spot on! The only thing that I didn't understand was their complicated system of having to sign a bill at breakfast every morning; I'm sure using the room key would be much more relaxed. When checking out I noticed that this system isn't flawless either, as two bottles of Veuve Cliquot were missing from my hotel bill. No reason to complain about that though!All in all, the Shangri La gives you an experience that has only one huge downside; recent stays in luxury hotels in Europe seemed very average &gt; if not under average. Spoiled rotten! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"We must have stayed in a different hotel! first of i'll start by saying, i wish id stayed in the same hotel as these other people writing reviews but our experience was very different. Upon arrival we upgraded 2 the horizion club and for this we will always be grateful and definitly recommend this upgrade, the staff here were helpful and pleasant and the benifits were aplenty from breakfast ,2 afternoon tea, pre dinner drinks and also the internet access and use of conference room and the Fab views of the Bund. Im afraid thats all we could find positive about this hotel. The hotel inside is nice enough but its like the tin man and its SO lacks a HEART and SOUL.. The staff smile but could care less about ur wants or needs and we found it went in 1 ear and threw the vacant eyes and out the other ear, without ever having registered as an actual question, need or want but that self same smug look just stayed there permanently on there faces and this, i found 2 be the same with all the staff we came in contact with. We had booked and paid for a delux, family smoking room in the old tower a few months previous but they booked us in2 a non smoking basic room on an non smoking floor (they then told us 2 smoke on that floor, rather than move us) with no extra bed for my 10 year old niece who traveled with us. We had 2 ask 4 a bed 2 be put in the room 4 her and the bed was old and heavy on the springs, infact we had 2 go see them the next morning as the beds were so hard and uncomfortable for us all. Now give them there due's they did add mattress toppers, which helped a bit but we found the beds very uncomfortable 4 a weeks stay, as when the extra bed was added 2 the room u could barely move in there. Its very much a 2 to 3 day stay hotel, infact its just a quick turnover hotel for business. The room amenities in the bathroom were great and well stocked but as far as tea and coffee goes they were they never replenished and when we called housekeeping 2 request this they couldnt understand and when eventually they did u were brought up 2 milk 1 tea and 1 coffee and no matter how many days they were told this, they still never replenished them the whole time we were there. with the time difference my niece found it hard 2 adjust and because of this on 3 occasions we were unable 2 go out for a meal and ordered in room service, 1st 2 occasions the meals werent great, the food was luke warm and the beans had not been heated at all but on the 3rd occasion no1 was able 2 eat it as it was stone cold even tho my meal arrived 10 mins after the others as it wasnt ready, it was still very cold when it came. I phoned them up and was told it would be taken off the bill but within 2 mins some1 was at the door 2 take the food away ( if u werent paying 4 it u werent having it) and as happy as we were 2 see the food go, we did find it strange, as it was done with more speed than anything else in the hotel during our stay. We started and ended our stay in Dubai in the royal meridien resort and spa and this may have been a bad thing as the service in the meridien is so good , it just made the shangri la's seem so poor and as every1 no's its the little things that count when ur away from home. AS A TOP TIP, please make sure u carry toilet roll when ur out shopping as they dont provide it in the malls. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great service with a luxury feel 'In Shanghai on corporate visit with the spouse. I've stayed in Shanghai before, and this is my favorite hotel (although I'm sure the Park Hyatt will give them some compeition.)I sprung for the Horizons Club level with Bund View in the older tower. While it's pricey enough, many extras make it worth the upcharge (e.g. internet acess included, as well as many amenities in the club lounge) and would be a bargain in many other cities.Room 2424 is very spacious, with floor-to-ceiling views of the Bund and the fun-but-goofy Pearl Tower. The view is particularly stunning at night when the Bund's art deco buildings light up, the more modern Pudong buildings put on their lights, and the dinner cruises turn on their colored lights and parade up and down the river. On a Saturday night, we were also treated to fireworks.Again, the room and bathroom are very spacious with spotless housekeeping. Modern/sleek Asian influenced furnishings provided a lot of drawer and closet space, all the usual electronics, and a roomy desk for working. Our room had a sofa in the sitting area, and flowers and fresh fruit were always on the cocktail table. There are many amenities that you expect in a finer hotel, including robes, coffee/tea maker, ironing board, separate tub and shower, loads of toiletries and complimentary necessities (e.g. toothbrush razor, nail clipper, etc. -- you could be shipwrecked here and still look presentable.)The Horizons Club lounge is wonderful, with views to the river and Bund. The breakfast buffet is quite extensive, with many things for Asian and western tastes. This includes many hot items (always some steamed dumplings and other Asian items; always some kind of egg dish with sausages and meats;) many cereals, fresh fruit and juice options; many cold breakfast items (cheese, etc.) exellent bakery and pasteries; etc. The drawbacks are relatively minor: coffee and tea are mostly serve-yourself, and the machine goes ONE cup at a time, leading to back-ups at busy periods. Eventually the staff comes around with coffee or tea to ease the line, but it is not automatic. Also: Monday is cooked-to-order omlet day -- NOT an everyday option.Also in the lounge: the bountiful teatime with pastries segways into cocktail time with lovely snacks and cheeses, and very nice assortment of wine, beer, soft drinks, and liquor available. As you would expect: there is an internet-access terminal available for guests, an assortment of newspapers, sofas and TV, and 2 hours of the use of one of their conference rooms can be reserved.The public rooms and lounges are classy and beautiful. The &quot;main&quot; lounge in the older tower has soaring windows that face the river, but the view may be blocked by landscaping for an immediate view. This room has music (often classical) during formal tea time, and something jazzier in the evening that seems to change nightly. There is also a bar in the new tower with great views, but the music to me is not as pleasureable (that kind of techno-rock that I find grating, but seems the thing to show that you are modern.)Each tower has a fitness area with lap pools and firness equipment. The newer tower has a more extensive spa, which I didn't try.There are a number of good restaurants on site, mostly upscale and Asian. The &quot;all-purpose&quot; Cafe Yi that serves breakfast through dinner has an extensive multi-cultural menu. However, the layout is somewhat confusing, which can lead to buffet diners missing some options. Still, I wish they'd have a plain mixed green salad on teh a la carte menu to accompany and dinners -- the closest they come is a Caesar salad prepared in the classic way -- with essence of anchoivies in the dressing. 'Sometimes you're just not in the mood...The staff throughout the hotel is exceptional -- polished, friendly, knowledgeable, and very willing to help. I especially appreciate the service with taxis. If you ask, the Concierge gives you a &quot;form&quot; note that identifies where you'd like to go. The staff at the taxi stand makes sure that the driver is clear about your destination. There are a number of dining options within walking distance of the hotel, including in the Superbrands Mall (some electronics stores, but otherwise mostly shops that appeal to younger adults.) The dining options there are mostly Asian, but also include a McDonald's, a Fresh Cafe for excellent healthier items (ground level with outside entrance), Hooters (next door, if you must) etc. The riverfront park also has many restaurants and outdoor optons, but we didn't try any of them. We may next time.There are a few excellent (but pricey) restaurants nearby on and near the Bund. Get there via the really cheap ferry that continually goes back and forth across the river. The dock is about a 7 minute walk from the back door of the hotel. Three on the Bund contains many of them: Laris, Wampoa Club, Jean-Georges (yes, THAT Jean-Georges,) New Heights (for more casual, bistro-type food.)Some may complain that Pudong isn't the best location, but it suits my professional needs, and really is not that much of an issue. Again, the ferry to the other side is cheap, and the cabs are still really pretty cheap -- $3 - 4 U.S. gets you to just about any of the Shanghai sites you'd want to go to.An aside from other visits: while the Ritz-Carlton Portman is nice, it feels colder and corporate than the Shangri-La's classy luxury and Asian feel. Also: when we went to the CJW at the Westin (wonderful dinner and service, with a view) the lobby seemed much too loud to be pleasant on a daily basis. The point: I'd much rather stay at the Shangi-La and take a taxi or ferry to other places I'd want to go.I've stayed at other Shangri-La's that were nice but not quite as impressive as this (e.g. New Delhi,) so I don't expect this to be every Shangri-La experience. However, for an in-town stay that didn't involve a suite, this place tops my charts. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Hotel! Very nice and modern hotel.Amazing stay at the Grand Tower.- Big comfortable room- Very modern interior- Flat Panel TV- Nice Bathroom with Rain Bath, Tub and LCD TV- Comfortable bed- Wonderful Floor to Ceiling windows- Good Service- Free wifi in the Lobby, but expensive broadband in the room- Noisy construction and street at night- Located beside Superbrand Mall: Lotus hypermarket, Zara, H&amp;M and restaurants like Ye Shanghai, Din Tai Fung and Element Fresh- Near the river promedade with great views of the bund- Elevators and Lobby are busy at times- Great location on Pudong but quite far from other attractions like Xintiandi and the Bund "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent location My husband and I stayed here in May while on an independant tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Hong Kong. We booked via the hotel website and took the value package which included airport transfers, breakfast and unlimited laundry. We were met at the airport and transported in a very nice Merc to the hotel. Cold bottles of water and cold towels were very welcome on the journey.Check in was in the room. We had booked a Deluxe Bund view room in the old tower which was fabulous. Lovely bathroom with separate shower and a fantastic view of the Bund - well worth the extra cost.In the hot and humid conditions we made good use of the laundry service which was swift and well laundered - it even came back in a basket with a lavender sachet!Breakfast was excellent. On the first day we sampled from the counters near our table and were very pleased with the selection. Then the next day we were seated elsewhere in the restaurant and discovered that we had missed as much selection again as there are two parts to the breakfast room, the joining point being where the fruit juices and smoothies are, so bear this in mind! We didn't eat in any of the other restaurants, but if breakfast was anything to go by they should be good.We went for a drink in the bar on the top floor of the new tower, Bar 36 I think it is called. Quite expensive but the view is fantastic and a pink champagne up there was a treat worth every penny.We had room service once, which again was swift, well presented and tasty.If you want to eat elsewhere without crossing the river there are plenty of places in walking distance including a couple of good casual eateries between the hotel and the shopping mall, facing the river. One to be recommended is right at the entrance to the mall and sells 'healthy' sandwiches and salads in a cool, clean and modern setting.There are two fitness centres and swimming pools at the hotel. Both pools are sufficient and nice for a cooling dip. The lobby lounge was a lovely place to relax over a drink in the evenings and they usually had a singer or group playing. Service could not be faulted. Very helpful and friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't think it was a problem being the other side of the river to the Bund. If you go out of the hotel 'backdoor' and turn left, you can walk 10 minutes along the river to catch the ferry across the river. This costs pennies and gives you good views on the crossing. Alternatively, you can go out of the same hotel exit, turn right and after 10 minutes will reach the entrance to the tourist tunnel. This is a cross between a cablecar and underground train system with flashing lights to entertain you as you go underneath the river to the Bund side. Ask at the hotel for directions as the tunnel is not at all well signposted. The aquarium and erotic museum in the same building as the tunnel is, in my opinion, not worth visiting unless you're stuck for something to do. To get the ferry back to the hotel side you need to be on the street level along the Bund rather than on the Prom where other boats go from - hopefully this info will save you walking up and down in the heat searching for the ferry terminal!All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel. Shanghai itself has less to offer than I had imagined but still glad we went. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Incredible But Some Service Issues Wow! What a beautiful and amazing place! Excellent location on the waterfront w/great view of the Bund - easy walk across the street. If you like modern decor (and I do) you will love this place. Do not miss the excellent International Buffet in the Yi Cafe. It is truly an event for your palate. The only issue I had was the service in the Yi cafe. Very slow and inattentive wait staff. This seemed to be an issue throughout China so I can't fault the hotel specifically - just know that it is an issue. I will definately book here again though. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Wow Stayed here for 3 nights in April - here are our thoughts.Rooms - we upgraded for 300rmb per night ( for the room not per person) to have room 2425 - we were not dissapointed. It had a stunning view of the bund - binoculars provided in the room - robes/slippers/upgraded toiletries/fresh fruit/flowers - the bathroom was excellant with a seperate shower and complimentry loofer !!!! With this room you also get access to the horizon club which means a complimentry lounge including first class breakfast with hot+cold food/nightly 2 hour cocktail session where all drinks are free as well as dim sum and other beautifull cakes and nibbles then throughout the day the lounge is available for free soft drinks &amp; cakes - all this for an extra $40 per night ($20 per person ) - fantastic value.Location - doesnt get much better - right on the waterfront - subway station 2 minute walk away - the hotel also attaches to a mall wherby you can access a supermarket in the basement.Staff - friendly - but being a very westernised city much of the chinese peoples strength in being kind and considerate and desperate to help you is lost.Food - only ate at the horizon club lounge but if there canapes and breakfasts are anything to go by then the restaurants in the hotel will be awesome.Facilities - there are 2 towers - the old one on the waterfront and the new one - the pool area in the old tower was pretty average - go to the new tower where you have a stunning leisure complex - the pool is vast, sauna lovely and the best ever steam room ive been in - plenty of towells slippers and robes in the changing rooms as well as tropical rain forest showers !!!! In the changing rooms there are also &quot;relaxation rooms &quot; where you can pour yourself a cup of tea and lie down and relax - the toiletries include lotions and hairsprays. This is all included in your room cost - the Chi Spa looks stunning and has price to match !!! You have to decide if you want a foot massage or buy a BMW - you cant have both !!!!!!Overall - taking everything into account one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in - pay the small upgrade fee to get the view and horizon club facilities - reception came down on the upgrade fee considerably !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Find your Shangri-la in Shanghai I stayed in the grand tower of the Shanghai Shangri-La for five nights. Owing to availability issues I took an executive suite on the 35th floor with a panoramic view of the bund and the Pu Dong river.The hotel is certainly opulent with high quality fixtures and fittings absolutely everywhere. Even the elevators had trick interiors with infinity mirror wall cladding!My room was not huge but was a very comfortable living space with very modern fittings. The bed was quite staggeringly comfortable, a huge sprawling double facing the window wall. A switchboard by the bed facilitated electic drawing of both net and drape curtains. The State of the art TV &amp; entertainment centre was easy to use, even if there was a limited number of English speaking channels.There is a free of charge DVD lending service available by calling &quot; one touch service&quot; which helped.There is a very well equipped work desk, with a drawer full of stationary items, and a fax machine if required.Free wireless was available but this was sporadic in reliability. A RMB150 charge per day was required for cable LAN access.Note that many websites, such as news.bbc.co.uk are censored in China. Your firewall is not broken when this happens, don't worry.The pleasant lounge area in the suite made for very comfortable and civilised work meetings with colleagues which went somewhat to justifying the high price for this room.The room was equipped with a &quot;stay boiled&quot; kettle which was very handy, and a reasonably priced and well stocked minibar. Nice touch items such as an unbrella, and an iron were also stored in a cupboard.The restaurants in the hotel were very good, as was teh room service food, but I recommend ducking to the next door shopping mall to eat sometimes, for cheaper and more interesting Chinese food.The gym was once again opulently equipped, and changing facilities truly first class. The bar on the 36th floor gets full of &quot;hostesses&quot; after ten pm, so aquiet relaxing drink needs to be had in one of the ground floor lounge areas, but that is not much of a hardship.In truth it was a fantastically comfortable hotel, that came as closeto being worth its price as any of the great hotels do, and very convenient for many large companies in Pu Dong.Recommended if opulence is of more importance to you than value. Not a very &quot;Chinese&quot; experience but truly one of the world's best hotels. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Beautiful hotel with a few service glitches Wish I coud give this one a 4.5 - as others have said its a beautiful hotel, elegantly finished, rooms are spacious in tower 2 with top quality bathrooms. But as with other reviewers the first room I was offered was not the one I had reserved, another case of offering a construction site view when a bund view was paid for. Now I know it mst be hard to sell construction site rooms but it was a little disingenous to show me to a room that was below what I had paid for and hope the late hour of check in would mean i did not notice! After that however, all went smoothly , great spa, efficient in room dining etc although will agree getting to the west side of the Bund is more difficult than I had presumed - for Bangkok regulars it is definitely not as easy as popping on the Peninsula water shuttle, its a good cab ride with the potential for traffic or the surreal tourist train! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent hotel Stayed for 3 nights in April having requested an upgrade to this hotel on our China tour. Initially a bit daunting, due to size and numbers of liveried staff, but soon realised it was very friendly and easy to navigate. We stayed in the old tower, had to crane to see the river, but you can see that from plenty of other places. Very good room with quiet and effective aircon and everything you could ask for. There was even an umbrella in the wardrobe in case of rain.The buffet area (Li-YI or something similar!) was huge and when we first looked in we did not realise how much choice there was. We therefore had first dinner at BATS american diner (part of hotel) which was fine but unexceptional. However breakfast is taken in the buffet area and was amazing. The choice was fantastic and very attentively served, to the extent that they re folded your napkin every time you got up!On the last night we dined at Jade on 36 (or 35?)which is excellent value for the quality and imagination on offer. A similar quality restaurant in the UK would be double the price. Our set meal was about £50 per head with wine from about £20. Given the view and the specialness of the venue this seemed fair value.The shops and bars were pricey compared to other places, but this is a top rate hotel. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby and a very good shopping mall. I walked to the Pearl Tower and had a ride to the top (the only westerner there). I wanted to do this, but at £10 it must be very pricey for the locals. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Simply Stunning This hotel is as good as its reputation suggests. We stayed there for 2 nights in March/April 2007.The public areas are immaculate, all polished marble and very airy. Restaurants (all 12 of them) are excellent, and the room we had in Tower 2 was superb. We payed a small fee to ensure a Tower 2 room on the 19th floor. And (even though we did not see any Tower 1 rooms) the extra outlay was well worth it. We would have no hesitation in staying there again, although Shanghai itself is not a great city. Very polluted! "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great hotel excellent service Stayed at first in the newer tower then in the old tower, just next to the river. Room rates are circa 20% more expensive in the newer tower than the old tower. Actually room view is better from the old tower, than in the new tower. ShangriLa has many great restaurants, and its restaurant and lounge bar JADE36 on the top floor of new tower, with the excellent DJ &quot;Kiko&quot;.ShangriLa very convenient to SuperBrand mall, and soon to the new IFC shopping mall (similar to HKG). "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"A Hotel that Exceeds all Expectations When booking your room in this great hotel make sure you ask for either a river view room in the old tower, or a room high up in the new tower with a river view. The reason for this being that the new tower is built directly behind the old tower so if your room in the new tower is too low your only view will be of the back of the old tower. Make sure you don't make that mistake! However, this hotel is really is amazingly luxurious. The rooms in the old tower are themselves what one would expect from a 5-star hotel but the rooms in the new tower really do exceed all expectations of what is defined as luxury. The food is, of course, being a Shangri-La, superb and the staff are, of course, friendly. This hotel certainly does not disappoint or tarnish the reputation of the world renowned Shangri-La chain, instead it does the opposite. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Pudong Shangri-La Just returned from 3 nights here. Hotel room and facilities were all fine but was a bit annoyed at check in with the hard sell of upgrades! First I was offered the Horizon upgrade at a cost of 700 RMB per night and was told this would get me breakfast and the afternoon canapes etc, said I wasn't interested as I wouldn't be at the hotel in the afternoons and breakfast was already included in my room rate and I think what the check in clerk was trying to tell me was that it would be a better breakfast! Was then offered an upgrade to Tower 2 at a cost of 350 RMB per night. Although Tower 2 is newer I tried to explain that a room in Tower 1 would be adequate as being a 5* hotel it shouldn't be anything less than in perfect condition for the rate we had paid. He didn't quite understand this. I do think there is something wrong in trying to get you to pay extra for the same room albeit in a new block, I think they should be offering guests these rooms at no extra cost if available.Regarding location, I have to say being on the Pudong side wasn't great. When on holiday I don't mind the adventure of public transport to get around so didn't think this would be an issue BUT the subway stops running before 11pm and we did have a few cabs refuse to take us back over from Puxi late at night. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Good Experience I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for 5 nights during a business conference last week. The hotel is located across the river on the newer side of Shanghai. In short, its an excellent place for the visitor to Shanghai for staying in: great rooms, service, multitude of bars and an award winning restaurants on the premises, good spa, shopping mall around the corner as well as a few sights such as the Jin Mao tower / Oriental pearl TV tower etc. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"fantastic Can't say much more than that. Definitely the best in China, and from now on my home in Shanghai. Rooms, staff, view on the river, bar, restaurant, breakfast : now THAT's what I call a hotel. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Perfect four days at the Shangri La We had high expectations for the hotel as we had stayed in the Bangkok Shangri La several years ago and thought it was fantastic. We were not disappointed as every aspect of the hotel from the service to the cleanliness was faultless. We had booked a bund view premier room in Tower 2 which was superbly appointed. The premier rooms are seemingly the largest in Shanghai and worth the money. We visited several other hotels during our stay including the Hyatt and much preferred the Shangri La. As we were on holiday we took advantage of treatments in the Chi Spa and used the leisure facilities which were great. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Superb Shangri-La Brilliant end to 2 weeks vacation in China. We'd booked a normal room but managed to get an upgrade to a suite as we checked in for our last 2 nights. No, it wasn't for free but..... The suite was spectacular with views on 3 sides. The upgrade price also gave us access to the Horzon Club lounge and the 2 hour nightly happy hour. (not to be missed) as well as breakfast in the Cafe (also not to be missed). So it was worth every penny. Overall the hotel is superb. Staff incredibly attentive, public spaces as well as the room spotless. Exactly what you expect from Shangri-La. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Very nice hotel in a good location Outstanding hotel with plenty of in-hotel facilities (lounge, bar, restaurants, etc). Rooms are very nice. Location is excellent for Pudong area. I requested and received a room in Tower 2. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Nice Hotel - But there are better choices in Shanghai Let me begin by saying this is a beautiful property overlooking the Huangpu River right across from the Bund. If you have a river view room, the view is spectacular especially at night. This is a large property with many restaurants (the ones we tried were excellent). The hotel also has a great spa, one of the nicest I have seen. There are two main downsides to this hotel, one is the cost and the other is the location. As for the cost, I don’t mind spending top dollar for an excellent hotel, but at this hotel you seem to be paying a huge premium for being isolated across the river in an area where there isn’t a great deal of competition. Everything from tea in the lobby lounge (around $10USD) to internet access at their business center is priced more for individuals on an expense account than someone paying for the service themselves. I compare these prices to what we paid at the Four Seasons across the river and it is nearly twice the cost. As for the location, in my opinion, the only benefit to being on the Pu Dong side of the river is the view at night and it is a bit closer to the International Airport. But Pu Dong is a new concrete jungle and you don’t really feel like you are in China – just look around at the Starbucks in front of the hotel, Hooters right next door or Hagen-Daz around the corner. This whole area has been constructed over the past ten years. Bottom line, if you just need a beautiful place to spend a night in Shanghai this is an excellent hotel. But if you want to experience Shanghai, and spend some time touring the city, best bet is to stay across the river – there are many choices and the hotels are equal and some better than the Shangri La "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great hotel once they actually give you the room you booked It's true what several other reviewers have been saying about the hotel not honoring your reservation. I had booked a Premier Suite through the hotel website and received an email confirmation stating that I had a view of the Bund.Lo and behold, when I walked into the smallish suite, I had a view of the construction site next door! The Bund was nowhere in sight. After 30 minutes of speaking to several people at the front desk, the manager on duty finally showed us a suite that indeed had a view of the Bund as promised. It was larger as well, much closer to what I had imagined. The only thing was, it wasn't made up yet.I'm spending $450 USD per night, and they can't even get my reservation right?!? A couple of days before I arrived, they had even emailed me to ask for my time of arrival, which I had provided. I simply don't see why they couldn't have made up that suite in time for my arrival. Were they just trying to put me in an inferior suite?Other than that intial fiasco, the hotel is great. The rooms are gorgeous, the views are stunning, and the service is, well, good for China. Just make sure you insist on getting what you thought you booked! And bring proof. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent hotel We stayed at this hotel in September as part of a business trip in China. It is indeed, as the other reviews say, an excellent hotel. We had a bund view room in tower 1 (the original buidling). The room was spacious and appeared to be freshly re decorated. the bed was huge and comfortable.The bathroom had a separate walk in shower that would accommodate 2 people!The Yi cafe is an experience in itself. You must try the buffet dinner 'with a twist.' Its the most amazing array of worldwide cuisine with lots of individual 'kitchens' serving different dishes. If you dont go for the food, go for the spectacular presentation. Round every corner is another suprise, from the fish tank, to the water wall, to the oriental kitchen - there will be something for you.Breakfast for us was unfortunately a little disappointing. As you usually find in the buffet style breakfast, you queue for toast, by which time the rest of the food on the plate is cold, or vice versa.The leisure facilities were excellent, and we found ourselves in the pool at 6am, and it is open till around 11pm.The lobby lounge bar is very comfortable, and there is another bar which is open till around 2am, where we found a 'late night singer' laid back music and a lovely calm atmosphere. We had a bar snack here at midnight, which was excellent value and a large portion also.We found that drinks in the bars on the Bund were more expensive than in this 5 star hotel! So we went back to the hotel!There are some cheap eating houses nearby, so if you want to keep the cost down, whilst staying in a first class hotel, there is plenty of cheap but good food to be found.Jade on 36 had fantastic views, but we went late night, and for us iit was a little loud and nightclubish, lots of youg people there, so we left and found the quieter late night bar with the laid back music.Tip: dont even try to get a taxi in Shanghai from anywhere except from the rank outside a hotel. The hotel staff will interpret where you are going to the driver. You have no chance of flagging a taxi down, or getting one from a Chinese rank unless you are fluent in Chinese! Stand at any hotels taxi rank - you dont have to be a guest there, but you may have to join the queue for 'non guests' it just takes a little longer!All in all, no complaints from us - and thats unusual! We will probably return to this hotel on our next trip. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Loved the Pudong Shangri-La H. on Viking's Yangtze R. Cruise Mr brother and our wives were booked here in August through Viking River Cruises, and this is truly a 5-Star hotel! The rooms we had were spacious and overlooking the Pudong River and the Bund just across the river. With floor-to-ceiling windows edge-to-edge in our Tower 2 room, the view was spectacular!The service was wonderful and the lobby is overwhelming in its beauty and design. Huge, with polished marble floors, but do take CARE in that lobby because, on our very first night, as I was &quot;leading the pack&quot; talking to the others over my shoulder, I didn't see a two-step drop in the middle of the lobby, and fell, breaking a wrist-bone. I was careless, but there should be a little more notice. These stairs go all across the lobby (stadium-type), so it's not obvious you are coming to a dropoff. Even so, we had a great stay, and the breakfasts, Western or Asian, were amazing.BTW, we've stayed at other Shangri-La's (Bangkok &amp; Singapore in the past; Xi'an, and Beijing on this cruise), and I'll put 'em up against any luxury chain. They do it right. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great Hotel-- some words of advice though All the reviews about this hotel are spot on, however I feel compelled to share my experiences in doing business and traveling in China. If I can help just one person avoid some of the hassles and mistakes I have made, I will have accomplished my mission. I had a great time at this hotel (my fourth trip to Shanghai) and to avoid some of what I am about to tell you, I splurged a bit and booked a suite at the last minute for about $700 US/ night. The most important thing to remember about traveling to China is that the culture is such that honoring a reservation is a distant second to trying to get you to pay more for everything. Don't worry, they don't specifically single out the tourists-- they spend the same amount of time doing this type of thing to one another as they will you. Since I paid through the nose for this reservation, black car service to and from the airport was included-- a little fact the American Express travel agent neglected to tell me. I only found out after I tried to book a car service through the hotel-- and after my american express platinum travel person wanted to offer me a car for $400 US each way. I have booked mutiple reservations (Shanghai, Xi An, Beijing) over the course of several years and many times they have claimed to &quot;lose&quot; my reservation (even the prepaid points reservations from American Express) and I have to fight to get what I have already paid for in some instances. My advice:1. Bring all of your documents of proof of reservation2. If you book through a third party (like a travel agent) and the third party gives you a confirmation number, don't assume the hotel will honor or recognize that confirmation number3. Whenever I can, I'll ask someone local to call the hotel for me and confirm. 4. If you want to arrange for a car to pick you up (highly reccomended) use VOIP to cheaply call the hotel and ask them to do it for you. 5. Be prepared to haggle for almost everything. Above all, try to keep your cool and understand that this is just part of doing business in China. Usually, if you put up a big enough fuss, they will give you what you deserve. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Outstanding! The epitome of five star! This is an outstanding hotel. I stayed in a Horizon Club room in Tower 1 with views over the river and it was superb. The location of the hotel really cannot be beaten. It is within a short walk of many of the Pudong sights and close to the Tourist Tunnel under the river to get to the Bund.The rooms are extremely comfortable and nicely proportioned. The dedicated Horizon Club check in and the use of the Horizon Club lounge were big bonuses.The health club was absolutely lovely, with a small but adequate swimming pool.The staff were absolutely fantastic. Very helpful indeed.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"5 star all the way The Pudong Shangri-La is a superb 5 star hotel with great staff. I was upgraded at modest cost to a suite overlooking the Bund on the 28th floor-sitting in the window in the late evening looking across the river at the city lights was endlessly fascinating. The Horizon Club is well worth the extra cost with the staff going the extra mile whenever asked for assistance, and the beautiful Spa in the new tower was stunning. One thing to be noted is that to get into the city involves a drive under the river, which in Shanghai traffic can take for ever!! and you can also find , as I did, a great reluctance on the part of taxi drivers to bring you back to Pudong-after five refusals, I walked to one of the big hotels in the city and asked them to get me a taxi and for them it wasn't a problem. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Absolutely Fantastic Ok so this is one of the most expensive hotels in Shanghai. If you are looking for a bargain then this is not the place. However, if you want a nice get away or are on a business trip definitely stay here. The rooms are tastefully decorated with facilities that I haven't seen in 5 star European or US hotels. The hotel itself has several great restaurants and a bakery. It is not in downtown Shanghai but then taxis are very affordable in Shanghai and the hotel staff can find you one easily.The Jade on the 36 bar has an amazing view of Shanghai, which is a must see. The other bars in the hotel have their own characteristics and are worth a visit (and so are the restaurants). We had a fantastic time staying there and I would definitely stay there again if I am back in Shanghai. If I were being really picky, I would say that the service at the reception desk was a bit impersonal. However, it was just that the staff's manner was bland. On the other hand, the bar staff were extremely friendly and helpful. And the bar in the lobby has live music every evening. Very Ally McBeal-ish later in the evening (a female duo) but it is not cheesy at all. In fact, it is really great. Worth having a drink or some nice chinese tea there. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Stayed Here During The F1 Shanghai Race Had a little trouble booking in but this was the fault of our travel agent and not of the hotel, however, it did highlight the language barrier problem.The hotel/room was fantastic we have a superb view of the Oriental Pearl Tower, the bell boys were fantastic writing down in chinese places we wanted to go and asking the taxi drivers.If you do go here for the F1 races, complimentary shuttle buses are put on by the hotel to local sports stadiums where F1 buses were waiting to take us to the track. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Very Good!! Moved here after having an unsatifactory stay at the Jin Jiang Tower. Boy, was we glad we chose the Shrangri-la. Hotel was grand and we had a deluxe room Tower 1 which is the older part. They were practically fully booked, so had no choice for rooms as it was last minute stay. Reception was friendly, and service was as expected. Room &amp; bathroom was very clean and very similar to the MO in KL. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and very good. Service needs a little improvement, not anywhere as good as the MO in KL. Overall, a good ending to our trip in Shanghai, which is an amazing city. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Absolutely fabulous I have travelled all over the world experiencing about 70 four and five stars hotels, but this hotel was one of the best. Perhaps only beaten by the Dubai Burj al Arab. We stayed with our two young daughters (2 and 5) and they had a great time - the staff is incredibly friendly, flexible and helpful. It would be unjust to qualify this hotel as a business hotel.The best part of the hotel is its breakfast. A plus! Or 10 out 10.The rooms are spacious, but be wise not to be too scroogy. Take a room with view over the Huangpu-river and the beautiful Bund. The view is a feast for your eyes.Of course, the roomrates are quite high, but I had no second thoughts after staying at the hotel. Quality has its price.We did not eat dinner at the hotel. The proximity of delightful Three on the Bund and M on the Bund proved to be too tempting. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Great hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3nights. I most likely won't return to Shanghai as i think one visit is enough, we ran out of things to do. The hotel was amazing. the food was great. There was such a variety. For dinner there was italian, austrailian, indian, chinese, thai, and that was just the buffet. You could either have buffet or choose from a menu, however i never saw anyone ordering from the menu. The staff were all very friendly. I stayed here with my family, and there werent many other tourists when we were there, however alottt fo buisness people, probably because we arrived on week-days. The hotels appearance is great, and my first impressions were positive. We were on floor 18, and had great views of the telephone tower, (which you can go up and get great views, however make sure its a clear day) We found China to be very muggy, and it never brightened up. The locals said it was due to pollution. I'm not sure. When going up the tower i wouldnt recommened paying to go right to the top, jus go to levels 1 or 2. After a while they all look the same. I liked that there was a huge shopping mall right next door, that was very handy, there was a supermarket in the basement, which had everythinggg. We went to the aquarium, which was around 5mins walk from the hotel, it was good, and little kids would love it. If you dont want to eat in the hotel, you arent short of other options, whilst walking to the aquarium, i found Hooters (which i think is a burger place), and a lil bar. But you have a huge shopping mall next door with everything in, pizza hut etccc. We were told that all the main shopping malls and sightseeing places were on the other side of the river (the hotels right next to the river) so if i had to return to Shanghai, i'd perhaps go to a hotel on the other side. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,Bunderbar Amazing hotel with superb room sizes.We were upgraded to rooms with a view of the Bund - worth asking for as the sight is spectacular and they know it - in fact they give you powerful binoculars to survey the skyline from the massive windows. Great idea.Everything about the room was perfect and everything you might have wanted was catered for. There was a huge separate walk-in closet and a stunning bathroom with TV.The whole design was very contemporary and felt very new.I didn't get a real chance to try out the restaurants but they looked great and if the breakfast buffet was anything to go by (which was AMAZING) then booking a meal in any one of the several restaurants can't be a disappointment. The hotel is split acorss two towers so be sure to ask which Tower you are in before coming so you get out of the cab at the right one. Also make sure you get the train from the airport - it takes 7mins at 301 km/h rather than a taxi which takes about 1.5hrs at 4km/h. Its only £9 but worth £90!Truly spectacular hotel. 
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"The best Brunch in Shanghai It's got to be the Yi Cafe, Shangri-La Hotel.Popped in several times during a four week stay in Shanghai, May 2006.The food is absolutely fantastic with five chefs providing the most mouthwatering dishes from all over the world.You can spend as long as you like on a Sunday afternoon, savouring all manner of delicious foods from oysters and tiger prawns to Malaysian curries. No worries for vegetarians with plenty of variety to tickle the most fickle of palate....and then cometh the sweet dishes, every type and colour imaginable with mind blowing ice creams and all manner of scrumtuous toppings. You can even request a small gift box and fill it with sweets / nuts etc.Even the kids have a great selection to choose from.The cost is extremely good for a ranked 5 star hotel - around £14.If you just want to dip in for afternoon high tea or for a snack pre -evening event, then visit the groundfloor lounge.The atmosphere is relaxed,often providing a talented musical ensemble to accompany your visit. The food is of a very high standard, plentiful and truly mouthwatering. Sit under the chandelier with a glass of champagne and unwind after the hustle and bustle of downtown Shanghai.For anyone thinking of visiting Shanghai...go on.. indulge!...or if you want to go local...then nip to nearby Carrefour and pick up a bullfrog from the live produce counter. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent business hotel with a wonderful restaurant Just came back from a stay of 5 days at this hotel in Shanghai, I stayed in a deluxe room in the old tower with a magnificent Bund view. While the rooms are a little bit older and a touch outdated, the room is of generous size and includes a bathroom of a more than adequate size with separate showerstall. Bed is very comfortable, only criticisim is that the furniture is a little bit outdated and the entertainment center (TV etc.) is not newest either (no LCD flat screen). High speed internet is available (for a charge of 120 RMB per day, or 40 RMB for the first hour), although it is not yet wireless in these rooms, I understand they have it for the rooms in the New Tower.Overall I was very satisfied with the room and housekeeping quality.Wonderful is their all day dining facility (Yi Cafe) which boosts just incredible buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is just unbelievable how many choices exist and how good the quality is. I even consider this buffet better than the one at Island Shangri-La in Hongkong.Also nice is BATS Bar, their nightclub where they have good live entertainment.Overall a very satisfying experience and I would definitely return again when in Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Few hotel can -- me off - this is the one Originally booked for 4 nights, left immediately after the first night:(1) No one come and help me when I arrived at the hotel with lot of luggages;(2) Given a room which is VERY OLD and outdated;(3) Room is dirty, and my skin becomes very ichy;(4) complainted but they just kept asking me to add money;(5) when I agree, they say there is no room;(6) twin beds for single traveller, booked non-smoking room, but given smoking room;(7) I requested to see other room (as from the hotel ad, the rooms are nice), they just say &quot;we are very busy, can you come in 10 minutes&quot;? (8) I was rushing for a meeting from breadfast, but found that I room was mistakenly locked (by hotel staff), and it tooks 15 minutes to open it;(9) RMB 46 for 15 minutes internet - it is just a robbery;(10) Have not been greeted despite a lot of staff around;(11) Swimming pool is very smelly - so as the gym "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Wonderful hotel My husband and I recently stayed at the Shangri-la, having been steered away from the Hyatt by our travel agent friend. It seems the Shangri-la has a reputation of being more elegant, less touristy.The hotel is indeed beautiful, and our rooms overlooked the Bund and Tower 1 of the hotel. We were on the 29th floor in a club-level room.The views were fabulous and it is wonderful to have access to the Club for breakfast and evening cocktails. We actually made a dinner of the hors d'ouevres one night, as they were so good.Beds were very comfortable, the room spacious and well designed, and the bathroom luxurious.Bouquet of orchids by the bed a nice touch. Service was excellent, and we had no difficulty getting help at the lobby for taxis, etc.Only &quot;negative&quot; is that it is across the river, and at rush hour taxis in downtown may not want to go to Pudong.(It only takes 5-15 minutes, and costs about $2-5, depending where you start from). Its also nice to be a bit away from all the hussle and hassle on downtown.If you're thinking of doing a lot of shopping about the city, we'd suggest hiring a car and driver from the hotel, armed with a list of where the shops and markets are in chinese.Overall, a great place to stay in Shanghai. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Love the dining! I love the hotel mainly because its dining area where you can eat buffet breakfast or dinner was just gorgeous. I mean gorgeous not only because the decor and the settings were perfect, but also because the food was superb -- Japanese, western, ethnic, and Chinese dishes plus cakes, chocolates, and pastries....The room was also spacious and immaculate with the river view. Truly, this is one of the best hotels in China. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Excellent service A typical conference hotel in the middel of financial/commercial district. Very noisy and smoky lobby, especially in the evening. The hotel is conveniently located just a few steps away from a major shopping mall, with excellent shopping and restaurants. The staff were friendly and helpful in general, but it was rather difficult locating a cab at the door since there was never an attendant there assisting guests in need. I was upgraded to a room on the 23rd floor. The room was fairly large with a nice view of the Bond and the park. A few days after I left the hotel, I remembered that I left a coat in the closet. I called the hotel. they located my coat and sent it to me via FedEx. I was quite impressed by their efficiency. I will probably stay there again for the location and service. "
pudong shangri la shanghai ,"Wonderful Hotel I have now stayed in four different 5-star hotels in Shanghai--Grand Hyatt, Four Seasons, J.W. Marriott and Pudong Shangri-La--and I think the Shangri-La is my new favorite. I reserved an executive room, and was upgraded to a deluxe executive room in the new tower (Tower 2). This room was easily the largest I've stayed in within Asia. In addition to the expected luxurious bath with bidet and separate bath and shower, the room included two desks (!), a large sitting area, 37&quot; plasma TV, two closets and miles of drawer storage. As others have mentioned, the breakfast and lunch buffets in the Yi Cafe are fantastic, perhaps the best and freshest I've ever had. Two reasons why I prefer the Pudong Shangri-La to the others: (1) better staff; and (2) a true walk-in lobby (unlike the Grand Hyatt and J.W. Marriott). I highly recommend this property. "

pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Surprised! Stayed at Shanghai Pullman Skyway on Oct 14 and 16..was really impressed by the sizes of the rooms on both stays! HUGE rooms with the comfy queen's sized bed and the toilet was sooo clean! The size of the room really threw me off guard...tv was good as well, with a wide selection of channels. It's about 15 min walk from Luban station, almost 40 minute cabride from Pudong airport. Breakfast at Zafraan was disappointing...the view from Le Ciel was awesome though. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"best hotel in shanghai We stayed last weekend in this hotel, me, my husband, our son and my parents.We arrived at 10 a.m. but they were able to give us one room an managed to give us the second one on the same floor, as we asked.The hall is very kitsch! You won't forget it! Take a look at the lamps in the whole hotel: really really bad taste!! Kind of funny..But the room (normal one) is huge, plenty of space for a baby bed and for our son to crawl around. Very new and modern, with comfortable bed, desk and chairs. The bathroom is also very spaciuos with bath tub and shower.The only negative thing was the concierge: we asked for directions and she sent us exactly in the opposite direction.. so after that we just consulted our map and didn't ask anything!Breakfast has a lot of good pastries, chinese food, sushi, eggs, bacons, fruits.. pretty much anything you like. And you have a very nice view from the 49th floor.The location is very good: you can walk to Huai Huai Lu and Xi Tiandi. Takes about 15-20 minutes to get to Pudong by taxi.We have been in many different hotels in Shanghai, but this is for me the best one, because it is new, prices are low, rooms are very big and the location is good.Oh! Parking is also complimentary, never happened before in Shanghai!Internet is also complimentary and worked fine, could skype with Austria in good quality. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"disappointed I decided to stay at pullman because of the positive reviews I saw. but ended up with a less than satisfactory stay. I'm writing this review from my hotel room.I had previously stayed in other pullman hotels and had good experiences.Pros:1)good location2) relatively new3) executive room is bigCons:1) unstable internet connection - my internet connection was intermittent. (staying in executive floor room)when i called the operator, she said nothing she can do, need to wait for IT dept to come in at 9am the following day. to me, stable internet connection is a basic requirement for a hotel catering to business clients. and most other hotels I've stayed in have IT help on call but not this one.2) as I was still breastfeeding my kid, I brought my cooler bag and also expressed milk during my trip. as the hotel room fridge is only a cooler and not a proper bar fridge, I requested the hotel staff to help me keep my milk(which have been packed and sealed properly in a cooler bag) in the hotel frrezer. They said no, can't do that. which is the first in the few 5 star hotels I've visited. and made similar requests. after I kicked up a fuss, threaten to see the manager and luckily I'm fluent in mandarin, they finally relented. but the damage is done. I left feeling very upset.3) water temperature in the shower is unstable. I tried to take a shower and the water keep shifting from very hot to cold and that made taking a shower quite uncomfortable. 4) Bed was not comfortable. It's similar to the type of beds (i.e. hard) in chinese run 5 star hotels, catering more to the local chinese preferences. 5) when I tried to call operator a few times. I had to wait very long.... they should have more pple manning the line! "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Amazing hotel in a great area I have just spent 10 nights in this hotel and will stay here again. This hotel is still being transformed by Accor into a Pullman and every change they are making is a good one.Check in was easy, I found the desk staff courteous and efficient and have to thank Rainbow who was the duty manager, she made a error on behalf into a positive situation – I was very impressed.We were in a junior suite which was very comfortable, a good size, good bathroom with separate shower and a very comfortable bed. I generally stay at Sofitel but am a Pullman convert. Pullman is not a family oriented hotel, which we appreciate, so nice not to have rug rats around.We used the hotel restaurants and found the dinner buffet good value and a new seafood buffet was launched why we were there, good variety of seafood and non seafood dished, any buffet offering Beijing Duck is a winner with me, although the dishes do change daily. Breakfast was good and we enjoyed the eclipse from the restaurant – great views, but after a few days we started skipping breakfast and going to the dum sum buffet in the Chinese Restaurant on level 3, it is popular and really good value, good food and great service. The service in all restaurants was food.The Hotel is in a good location, walking distance to a few supermarkets, plenty of restaurants and a short cab ride to any of the city sites it is a short walk to Taikang Lu and the former residence of Sun Yat-sen two Shanghai must sees. There is also a subway station opening in this area soon which will be a bonus, but taxies are still easier and very reasonable. Luwan is a good area and has a lot to offer, the French Concession is well worth taking the time to explore.We enjoyed our stay and are already planning our return trip and will stay in the Pullman again. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in! From entering the spacious lobby we saw that this was something special but when we saw our room we thought that there had been some mistake as it seemed that we had been allocated a small suite! Luxurious massive extra king-sized bed with plenty of room to store cases, bags, cameras etc. etc.The bathroom was out of this world and provided a panoramic view of the city (we were on the 33rd floor) from a bath with an unobstructed view through massive windows. Service was fantastic from breakfasts on the 49th floor to a cozy bar on the 50th floor which enjoyed probably one of the best views of a city we have ever seen. Staff were always friendly and even though few spoke English we were always able to make ourselves understood with little effort on our part.Swimming pool looked amazingly welcoming but unfortunately we didn't have time to use it!Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for tourists and probably business clients as they had extensive conference facilities. Staying here really put the shine on an already fascinating visit to China. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"You're in good hands here. Unlike some places in China, the Pullman doesn't merely look like a good hotel; it really is a good hotel. Everything works, the staff are knowledgeable and helpful and the food is OK. The restaurant and carvery serve wines from all over the world, wines you have heard of. No sign of Great Wall or Goldenball (this is good). They do room service and that's good. The hotel has its own minibuses which work out cheaper than taxies if you want to go out as a small group. This is a proper hotel. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Really enjoyed this lovely hotel We had 2 seperate 3 night stays at this hotel with our 3 small children and enjoyed our time at the Pullman. The first night we arrived the property was full and we were unable to get the connecting rooms that we had requested but the following day we were upgraded to connecting executive rooms. The rooms are very nice and very spacious. We had rooms on 39th floor so the views were great. Bathrooms were beautful with seperate shower and baths (i would prefer that there was a wall between bathroom and the room which there wasn't in the executive rooms but they did have a curtain). Breakfast on the 49th floor was good but a bit expensive. Rooms Service Menu was also expensive with no real options for the kids. We had a babysitter (Anna &amp; Gretta) arranged through housekeeping on 2 occasions which the kids enjoyed. One of the nights we went upstairs to the Blue Bar (50th floor) which was beautiful. Around the hotel there were quite a few really good local restuarants well within walking distance. Taxis were easy enough to get and cheap. Metro was not too far but Taxi's were easier. We were really glad we picked the Pullman, Staff were excellent and we enjoyed our stay. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"A fantastic hotel that will only get better once the new Metro line opens I finished a recent trip around China with 3 nights in the Pullman Skyway, as a little treat to myself.I arrived at the hotel at around 10.30am, after a 12 hour overnight train journey from Beijing so was desperately in need of a shower! I didn't even need to ask the receptionist if an early check-in was possible as she immediately assigned my room (and upgraded me to a suite!)The hotel itself has only been open since April, it occupies the top half of a new 50 storey tower. If you've stayed in a Pullman before, you'll know that they're along the lines of a modernised Sofitel and this one certainly didn't disappoint. They also include free internet connection in your room rate, so no paying obscene access charges in your room. The Health Club and Swimming Pool is also very nice, and was certainly welcome after a long day in the smog, heat and humidity of Shanghai.The staff are very attentive, without appearing pushy, and were only too happy to give me a rundown of their city as a first time traveller.The only negative thing I could say about the hotel is that the Metro stop is currently about a 10-15 minute walk. However, as with most things in Shanghai, the Metro is expanding rapidly and a new line is shortly opening that will be around a 2 minute walk from the hotel, so this will certainly rectify that.As for location, it's slightly to the West of the centre, so the journey to Nanjing St (the main shopping area, and heart of Shanghai) takes around 10-15 minutes by taxi or Metro.I'd certainly recommend this hotel, you can't fail to be impressed by it. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Not worthy Pullman brand This hotel has changed management to Pullman, and has a long way to go before it lives up to this. Rooms are quite big with large bathrooms. Apart from that both the rooms and the rest of the hotel is very impersonal. Worst part is the restaurants, absolutely no atmosphere, unless you consider blue lighting nice. Feels more like an apartment complex with some mediocre sterile restaurants. Breakfast average, too low capacity compared to the size of the hotel and helpless service. Kind of in the middle of nowhere. Would not recommend it. There is a reason the price is not too high. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Not a good experience If you are an A-Club member don't bother asking for an upgrade as they don't understand the rules at all. I spent 45 minutes at check in with my platinum card, requested an upgrade and 4 staff members later was told it was not in the rules. The food is very average. The buffet never changes except for the carvery dish, which seems to alternate on consecutive evenings. Very boring and very average. Waited 40 minutes for a glass of wine which seems to come from a differnt floor. The service was terrible constantly, and we twice witnessed a concierge staff member who we knick named &quot;Rocky&quot;, assaulting guests, who we think were jumping a taxi line. Rocky wouldn't leave things. After his initial pushing, shoving and abuse in chinese he would walk away and then return to the guest who was doing nothing for another go ! It was unbelievable. This happenned twice and the rest of the staff just looked on giggling. Not a nice place to stay and not the usual pullman standard. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Average in comparison with other Pullman in SEA Stayed at a number of other Pullman's, but the Skyway is well below the standard of the ones in Xian and Bangkok.Positive:Nice recreational facilitiesComplimentary internet accessGreat views on high floorsNice bathroomsNegative:Club floor rooms are not worth the money, small and bland roomsFront line staff not overly helpful (asked for the nearest Starbucks and was given three times different directions by the same person)Club lounge canapes poor in quality and quanitityVery limited English TV chanelsOverall not up to the standard of other Pullmans, but maybe I am just spoiled after staying at the fantastic Xian and Bangkok Pullmans "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"perfect hotel This is a truely unexpected and unbeliavable experience! The hotel was great, the rooms were clean and tidy beyond expectation! the service was good as well. The environment was superb! Deco was modern and attractive. Though the food in the restaurant was not as 5 stars as it suppose to be but the environment compensate the whole thing! "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Probably the Best I'll Stay in My Life! I stayed here for about 3 nights in May 2009, as part of a tour I took with China Spree. We stayed here unexpectantly, China Spree arranged it at the last minute for whatever reason and I am sooo happy they did. The hotel was not only the best one I stayed on the tour, but probably will be the best I'll ever stay in my lifetime! The hotel seems to cater to traveling professionals/executives, with conference/meeting rooms on the 2nd floor. The lobby is fantastic and impressive, with a huge color-changing chandelier thing on the ceiling and a large fish tank behind reception/concierge.The service at the hotel was also excellent. I was really impressed that they treated everyone so well (and I was far from dressed as a professional, I dressed pretty backpacker-ish in cargo pants and t-shirts). From the bell boys to the restaurant staff, I've never been so well-received as a guest. The rooms were great! I had a single and the bed was deliciously comfortable, which is rare in China, where most beds are pretty stiff. This one was just perfect--not too stiff, not too soft. Room for me was quite large too. Showers were really nice too, and good English/Chinese selection on TV. For the most part, I really thought my room was super clean, the only bad thing was on my last night while lying around watching TV, I found a clipped toe nail in my sheets. :( Definitely not mine, but that was the single bad thing I found with the hotel...The breakfast buffet is pretty good, and better yet it's up on the 49th floor! Or 50th...somewhere high on top so you can get a great view of the city. Don't bother getting goods at the bakery on the first floor, you can get them at the breakfast buffet! Food was a mix of Chinese and American continental.Pool was indoor, I didn't go in but checked it out and looked nice. There are also gym/spa facilities.Internet is quite expensive. I forget the price, but whatever they charged for 15 min. was the same of what Guilin/Xian charged for like an hour or so! Location--can't really comment since we had a shuttle bus to take us around the city. But taxis are everywhere and cheap.I would highly recommend the Pullman Shanghai Skyway Hotel! It was a nice 'luxurious' stay to the end of my 2 week trip around China! "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,lovely new efficient hotel had 2 nights here - the rooms are large and comfortable with spectacular views - especially the 50th floor restuarant .bit away from downtown 
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,Excellent Hotel We enjoyed our stay at Pullman Shanghai. The Deluxe room was huge and equipped with every amenity expected of a 5 star hotel and most of all comfortable beds. The location may be a bit far off from the subway line but it didn't bother us as taxi was an easy and expensive to travel around. The Luwan District was quite centrally located and in close proximity all hotpots in Shanghai.Will definitely stay at this hotel again! 
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Convenient and Comfortable I was born in Shanghai and now residing in Taiwan. I really enjoyed every minute staying at this new hotel with my wife and kids during my recent visit back in Shanghai. It is, from a Shanghainese point of view, one of the most convenient hotels in town, given its easy access to city centre, freeway, railway station, and commercial district, all within 15-20 min drive. The rooms are well-designed and decorated with large bathroom, better than any of the 5-star hotels nearby. The only pity maybe the price of beverages a bit higher than average, with a bottle of Evian costing RMB 50. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Best location on PuXi side This hotel has the best location on Puxi side, 10 mins taxi ride to Xintindi(dining and entertainment district) and walk distance to art and design area call Bridge 8 and Tianzifang. 20mins taxi ride from Hongqiao domestic airport and 45mins taxi ride from Pudong international airport. Hotel has a beautiful lobby and nice outdoor cafe. Breakfast serve the best donut in China, I have to say it's better than Dunkin Donuts. Bar on 48 floor also offer nice view of Shanghai. There is a Cantonese style restaurant around the corner open 24 hours, good place for quick lunch or late night snack.Room is very clean and modern, staffs are very friendly. I have stayed at many 4~5 stars hotels in Shanghai, Skyway offer the best of all. I had a great experience during my 4 days stay. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Excellent Beautiful Hotel We stayed here with our tour group ChinaSpree for 3 nights in November. Beautiful hotel, clean nice, quiet room and beautiful bathroom. Everyone from the front desk to the maids were wonderful. They ran out of my husband's beer and told him they would have it back by the next night when we showed up they did not have it but the hostess went to the store and brought some back for him. Easy cab ride to everything - Shanghai Acrobats, The Bund, The Knock off market, the Bazaar and the Jade Buddah Temple and the Shanghai Museum. Would definitely recomend and the breakfast was wonderful with french pastries, sushi, western items - yummy! Highly reccomend. Any questions - I would be happy to answer them for you. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Could not fault it We stayed here in October 2008 and were highly impressed with the Skyway. Firstly, the staff - they were all so friendly, helpful and eager to help, from the housekeepers to the receptionists to the porters. I don't think I have been anywhere so welcoming!They helped with where to go, even drawing a map to the nearest pharmacy and translating 'asprin' for me on a card to present to the staff in the chemist ( I had a banging headache at the time!).The hotel itself is in a good location - we never waited long for a taxi (which is such a cheap way to get around) - by the way, ask for the attractions card from reception. You can then present this to the taxis drivers when you want to get somewhere. It was spotlessly clean, the room spacious (it was a deluxe room but the price was not much more than standard).Nice plasma screen, high quality furnishings, lots of attention to detail. Above all, its exceptional value for a hotel of this standard. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"good new First Class Hotel the Skyway Landis Hotel seems to be pretty new. The staff still struggles with the service but is extremly friendly. The restaurants in the hotel are average, the bar ok but always practically empty. The rooms are very nice and modern.I have selected this hotel for business reasons , so if you have business to do in this area of SHA then it is for sure the best choice. It is as well in walking distance to the &quot;old&quot; part of Shanghai with many great restaurants (western food as well) and many little butiques. Actually found in this corner of SHA the best Italian Restaurant you can find in SHA (called Pasta &amp; Pizza). "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Reasonable place to stay in Shanghai Stayed here for two nights during a weekend trip. Landis is a good Taiwanese hotel chain, and this is a brand new property in Shanghai. The hotel is tall and the colorful top can be seen from far away at night.Rooms are very large and comfy, with soothing decor. However the details in the decor are poor if u look beneath the surface. Service was a little lacking as it was still new when I stayed.Location was OK but not the most convenient. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Nice new hotel that can hold its own against the big names The Landis properties in Taiwan are usually very good (perhaps the best hotel chain no one has ever heard of?), so this was a natural choice, even more so because the price was right. The rooms were big and the food was great. They are still working out some kinks since this is a new hotel (i.e. not all of the restaurants are open, but the breakfast buffet on the 49th floor is very good). The gym is a little bit on the small size for a swanky property of this scale, but big enough, plus the pool is huge, with a view of a neighboring park. The Parriss buffet in the basement is a seafood lovers dream (and a seafood haters nightmare).The only big negative I found is the smoking issue, but this seems to be this way everywhere in Shanghai. The non-smoking restaurant sections seem to still get lots of smoke. My non-smoking room still had matches and an ashtray in it (but did not smell like smoke at all). Also, the staff's English skills seem to be lacking, and non-Mandarin speakers might have some trouble with housekeeping, etc.. The maid left a rag in my sink, but no big deal and she apologized profusely when I saw her and handed it back to her in the hallway. This hotel is located in an upscale residential area, but taxi rides to Pudong and major eating/shopping centers were quick and cheap. "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Exceptional Service - Well Priced! This is a stunning hotel which would be in the top 10 hotels in Shanghai....It doesn't seem to ever have many guests given that it is still new and hasn't built up such a reputation as of yet but having paid US$100 each night on a discounted booking website you really can't go wrong.The best hotels in Shanghai are the Hyatt, the Meridien Royal, the Shangri-la and the Westin on the bund. However, it would be difficult to find these below US$250-300 a night. This is not the case with Skyway Landis which offered a very good international 5 star hotel (high level rooms, e.g. 30th-50th floors, a large indoor pool, sauna, gym etc and good service from the staff).....Would definately return to this hotel for good service and a reasonably well priced stay in what is otherwise cheap Shanghai.... "
pullman shanghai skyway hotel ,"Good hardware but bad software For being a newly opened 5-star hotel, it used all high class hardware (i.e. sanitary facilities, and a 42&quot; LCD TV of &quot;Panasonic etc.), the location is also very good and near the city center. However, the services provided (software) needs a lot to be improved. I requested the reception whether I can have a late checkout at 1430 a day before checkout, and they said alright. So, I go out for some shopping before leaving Shanghai. Unfortunately, when I got back to my room at 1300, my door key is inactivated and when I asked a housekeeper that floor whether she can open the door for me to put those stuffs into my room first and then I would go to the reception to see what had happened, she refused to do anything and urged me to the reception. Then, I was carrying all my stuffs and went back to the reception at ground floor. I asked them whether my keys were incabable of open the door because of the late checkout? And their answer very promptly was &quot;Yes, it does.&quot; They thought it was usual and no guilty to asked a client to re-activite their door card after usual checkout time even he had had asked them for this favour just last night.Things to remember : 1) the degree showed on the monitor of the air conditioning is not trustable, when it indicated that the room temperature was 27 Celcius, the actual temperature was much lower, bewared to have a cold.2)they only provide feather quilted cover and you will properly get all wet by sweating at the middle of nights!God Bless everyone who are going to take this hotel!

purple mountain hotel ,Great hotel and a great location This is a great hotel with spotless rooms and great service. It is minutes from downtown with a taxi ride of about 3 dollars from most major tourist areas. Hotel is very affordable and comes across as a five star. Great views from the higher floors of the whole city or river. 
purple mountain hotel ,"Very nice - but not for people with fear of heights This hotel was a sigh for sore eyes, after having travelled for hours. If you are afraid of heights, stay away. I am not usually effected by heights, but this was a little frightening.The rooms very large, and very comfortable. I stayed in one room with my sister and ordered room service. We didn't have to wait for too long, and it tasted great. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Best stay Abroad Purple Mountain is amazing. first impression is absolutly positive when you are in the huge lobby, two ladies in black dresses playing Piano and fluette, amazing atmosphere. the room was spaciuos with a study desk, fax machine, the bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower, you will find in the room everything you need, from Iron and Iron stand, Umbrella, tea set with complimentary tea bags..etc.Next time I go to shanghai, I will forsure stay in Purple Mountain "
purple mountain hotel ,"Death trap I just spent one night at the Purple Mountain Hotel with colleagues. Due to a fire at the hotel, we had to leave in the middle of the night and book into another hotel (Grand Hyatt, warmly recommended). That as such was not too bad, accidents happen. But in this case the fire was in the 5th floor, it was big enough so that our 37th floor was full of smoke, and not a single fire alarm went off in the entire building! We were lucky enough that one of our colleagues woke up to the smoke. You would expect such an expensive hotel to take care of basic safety systems professionally, but apparently anything goes in this place. I have tried to find out more about the fire in the web, but there seem to be no news about the incident. Hopefully nobody died. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Great price excellent hotel Checked out the Purple Mountain as a New Year's treat to finish a 10 day budget/backpacker-style China trip. Arrived without reservation and was offered (without negotiation) an exceptional 590 RMB rate for a lovely room on the 38th floor with a great view. The buffet lunch at their restaurant was not comparable to local restaurants as stated in some other reviews - it was FAR superior (and I thought I hated buffets...). Local Chinese food is great, and much cheaper, no question, but this was 5 star food at a 5 star hotel and the price was not high enough to warrant complaint from those of us from North America or Europe. The same quality lunch at home would be at least twice the price. Prices at comparable Shanghai hotels, as well, as stated in other reviews, are NOT lower but rather twice or three times the price. The lowest rate offered by the Hyatt was 2100 RMB. A cheaper 5 star (or if you insist, 4 star, by non-Chinese standards) is IMPOSSIBLE to find for what we paid (the equivalent of US$75). Very highly recommended! "
purple mountain hotel ,Excellent food Service was very good but not exceptional with asian standards. Rooms are very clean and well mantained.The food is exceptionally good and will make your stay a pleasure. For one you should try the special noodle dishes prepared on display by a dedicated noodle chef. Meeting facilities exellent. 
purple mountain hotel ,"Fantastic view We have stayed at the Purple Mountain a couple of times while we were visting China, It is a beautiful hotel with high standards, We had rooms on the 17th floor and 30th floor, a fantastic view from either, Breakfast is very good and caters for Westerners. The hotel is quiet, clean and rooms are fairly large, bathrooms are a good size as well.The restaurant in the hotel was very expensive, there are lot's of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and much cheaper.Take the Metro from Dongfang Lu to the Science Museum underground market, pay three yuan one way, Westerners have a &quot;twice the price face&quot; so half whatever they ask for, then half it again as your starting price. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Modern hotel transport links not great We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of April. The hotel itself is new, high quality, 5 star establishment. Rooms are decorated to a high standard. The breakfast/ lunch buffet is excellent. Note - pool does not open until June &amp; DongFang metro station is closed for about 6 months. This means there is a 15 minute walk from the the nearest metro. You can always take a cab into town but beware it took us 50 minutes to get to the Bund due to traffic at midday. You are better off getting a cab to a metro station.There is also construction on new buildings nearby (we did not notice any noise as the work was just starting)Probably not ideal for tourist until metro is back up and running apart from that would recommend. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Exceeded my expectations newly built modern decor I visited this hotel for the new year's holiday with my boyfriend this january and was delighted to find that this hotel was so modern and well-appointed. It was my first visit to shanghai, so I had no expectations since i did not know anything about the hotel other than the fact that my boyfriend's mother had stayed at the same hotel on a recent trip. Upon entering the huge lobby, I was surprised to find a massively decked out christmas tree with a banner reading, &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; I didnt think communism and christmas were compatible but, apparently, they are. During check-in, the receptionist was very friendly and quickly upgraded us to an executive room on the highest floor. Upon entering our room, we were impressed by the contemporary dark hard wood floors, modern decor, and immaculate bathroom. The room was smaller than expected and there was no actual wall dividing the bathroom from the bedroom area, just a curtain, which could have been a serious privacy problem for some people, but the bed was very comfortable with a great mattress, super soft sheets, and a plush down comforter. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) for their fabulous selection of eastern and western delicacies, but the dinner selections leave much to be desired, are quite expensive, and are better left undiscovered. The staff are very helpful and friendly when approached, but they do not hover, so some may interpret this as disinterest. Overall, the experience was very pleasant, with the exception of a very bizarre incident, in which a foot masseuse, who worked for the hotel, followed us up to our room and barged in because we payed for the massage by charging it to our room rather than paying cash as she preferred. We had to call the concierge to talk to her in order to get her out of our room! Crazy lady! Moral of the story: great hotel, great amenities, just don't get a foot massage. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Comfortable hotel good services I stayed in Sept. 2005 for business and found the hotel a superb place overall. My room on the 39th floor had a great view. It was nicely furnished and came with a large TV. The bathroom was good size and nicely appointed. The breakfast buffet offered good selections, and the staff was helpful. The &quot;broadband&quot; Internet connection is excruciatingly slow -- like a dial up service in the U.S. The hotel is great for business travelers, but if you are in Shanghai purely as a tourist, you don't need the amenities or pay for the price of Purple Mountain. "
purple mountain hotel ,"good but too expensive in particular services I am staing in the Purple mountian for a couple of days august 2005. The place is good and offeres all services you´d expect of a 5*. I paid a special rate of 135 USD, which is still a lot for Shanghai standard. You can get a good 4*-place for half that plrice that offers everything needed (gymnn, internet etc. is standard in all 4 * i ve seen up to now). A partcularity is the swimmignpool on the roof of the 5th floor - very nice view.Even worse- everything is very expensive here, laundry is triple price comapred to others (45RMB for a shirt instead of 10/15 in 4* places i staid before), I paid 45 RMB (4.5 Euro) for a very bad expresso, 120 RMB per day for internet (free or cheap in many 4*). Food is OK, but comparable or better Chinese or Japanese food you ll find in the small places that you ll find all over Shanghai(where you can eat for 50-70 yuan a full meal in a nice place, as i did yesterday, even alone withe same improvisation. Quite a few of the upper class restaurants have enlish menues or pictures on the menu ). The only catch is the breakfast ... 4* places often have chinese breakfast only (which is a hot meal of rice and meat and fish, reasonable coffee is available though).So to my conclusion if you have somebody that can help you to get around and order food, or if you like the adventure of ordering food in China... better stay in a 4 *. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Pricey 5* Stayed at the Purple Mountain on 21 Apr 05 while the Shanghai Auto Show was going on. Due to the auto show most of the hotels in Pudong were fully booked. The Executive room at the Purple Mountain was of 5* quality, but very expensive at 1660rmb plus a 249rmb surcharge. This equates to about $230 for one night, which is over priced. I was also charged 57rmb for internet, which I did not use. Beautiful property, excellent room &amp; above average buffet breakfast. But, too expensive. "
purple mountain hotel ,"Nice Hotel but hard to find info on! Stayed at Purple Mountain for about 10 days in March 2005 while in Shanghai for a trade show and a little tourist time. Located in Pudong, it was pretty convenient to the New Shanghai Expo Center, about 10 to 30 minutes depending on traffic. This is a huge benefit vs. hotels on the other side of the River in old Shanghai. It is a good location for a business hotel.I didn't find it difficult to get across the river for restaurants, sightseeing, or other activities. Taxis very cheap and prompt. Local shopping, etc. not as good as on other side though.The hotel is very nice. Rated 5 stars by Chinese Tourism and I would classify it as nice as most Hyatt, Westin, Radisson, etc. hotels in most cities. However, not to the scale of 4 Seasons, Grand Hyatt, et. al. Probably not a 5 star hotel though. Rooms dark wood and rich and very nice. Restaurant excellent for breakfast and very good for dinner. Served Western and Asian foods. I did not get to try the Chinese Restaurants in the hotel. There were some excellent Chinese restaurants nearby that worked great for us when we were with our local hosts. The business center was very good. However, in room broadband was very slow. I don't think that was the hotel's fault but do to local internet service. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Lastly, the rate was quite a value compared to most hotels of comparable amenities. I only paid $120 night which I found to be quite a bargain. "

radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Good Hotel in Great Location In Pu Dong I stayed at the Radisson Century Park Pu Dong for four nights for business. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and large. The buffet breakfast was good. Staff spoke good English. Free internet and satellite TV with a lot of English channels. At $170.00 USD per night with breakfast a decent value in Shanghai. The hotel is adjacent to a shopping and restaurant area with a Carrefour, many small stores, and numerous restaurants. Malone’s American Café has good western food and the Korean Barbeque place was very good. I would rate this hotel a solid 4 stars in a good location and would stay again. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Business needs fulfill but not really for tourist I don't think I have to comment much on the room and service.It fulfills my basic needs. As for the breakfast, it is not to my liking at all especially since I had seen them placing some of the breakfast food as early as the night before. However, there is a no of decent restaurants or cafes nearby. Some days I would skip the buffet breakfast and grab a sandwich or scone from the cafe or starbucks. The gym is well equiped. After a day's work, it is nice to go for a good and cheap massage near the hotel.For me. the conciege is helpful and knowledgeable in directing you to the places where you want to go. Location is not a plus for tourist. It costs about minimium 30 yuan to travel to xintiandi, nanjing road or anywhere around the bund if the traffic is smooth and the driver is not taking you for a ride. Especially since not every driver knows this hotel. It is useful to have directions written to you in Chinese and show it to the driver. The subway will be a better and faster choice if you feel like walking. And don't be fooled by the Shanghai map, it looks further than what you think. Overall this hotel is good and affordable. But if you are a tourist and not on a budget, you might consider elsewhere. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Business Hotel with good facilities and ""soft beds"" Our company has company-rate at this hotel. I stayed here in August 2009 for two periods of 2 day's as part of china business trip. I have stayed here more often and am alway's pleased to return back. the loby staff is very helpfull, the beds are &quot;soft&quot;, the internet is free of additional charge and the breakfast-buffet is very good; just the basic minimum needs for a business traveler that are fullfilled by this Hotel. Also outside the hotel to the right side there is very good choise of restaurants, where chinees Queen was my faforit, but also Thai and other eating facilities were present.Transportation from Pudong-airport can be done either by Maglev + taxi or taxi (both way's about RMB 120 and takes about 30-40 minutes. Transportation from hotel into town (puxi-nanjin road west) can be done by taxi direct (RMB 45 day-time) or by taxi&gt;science Center&gt;Metro line2 (RMB 16 (11 + 5); in the night the taxi is about RMB 65.Bee aware up to Expo 2010 the whole city is a big road-construction site resulting in multiple trafic-jams, even late evening and night. If you are frequent visiter of the Puxi side for the evening entertainment, you easy have to count for 30min-45min single drive.Of course this is not to blame to the hotel. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Good Hotel Good Hotel. Modern Facilities. Easy access if you are to go somewhere in Pudong. Got a Carrefour nearby, and for the Indian traveler, there is an Indian Restaurant just around the corner.. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,Decent business hotel Due to recent budget restrictions my company decided to narrow down the choices of contract hotels in Shanghai. The Radisson is one of the hotels which made the cut. Rooms are clean and the breakfast is good and internet is free.The hotel tries to be trendy but does not quite get there. Most of the staff are trying to be friendly but is not yet very experienced and often do not know how to handle out of the ordinary requests.They definitely have to upgrade their key card system soon. Everytime you get into the lift you see people failing to use their cards to get to their floors. I had to return to the reception 2 times to finally get a key card which could actually open the door to my room.The Radisson is also a little far out from the business centers in Pudong and Puxi.However price is ok and the basic needs are covered. 
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Good enough Had to stay here for business and my trust in my China colleagues was not misplaced. The location is a little off, nowhere near downtown, but it was near the office, and as other reviewers mentioned, have enough restaurants, bars and shops to serve the expatriate and local community here. The overall decor is nice, like a psuedo W, with overpriced Chinese contemporary art all over the hotel.The room is also nice and large enough, and the cream/white walls, decor and furniture still look brand new. The internet is also free , which is great and rare in most other countries.Breakfast was the typical 4-5 star boutique quality and style. But you are better off with the traditional beef noodles across the street. And venture out for lunch and dinner outside too, much more variety out there.It was also March but still freezing at 5 degrees when my colleagues and I were here. My colleague didn't know it was so cold, and the concierge lent him his personal leather jacket when my colleague wanted to go out. wow "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Good food OK accomodations Strayed at this property in Sept 2008 as part of a global business meeting held in ShangHai. The food and service were excellent, the buffett for breakfast, lunch and dinner a good mix of western and chinese styles. The room, just so-so. ShangHai is a very humid city (like Miami). The upstairs floors had a distinctive odor, somewhat musty and this carried over to the rooms. Didn't bother me after a couple of days but was strong my first day. The rooms are already starting to show their age / tired decor. The bathroom is nice, but starting to date. The bathroom has a glass wall to the room - hope your spouse doesn't need privacy in the bath or on the john. beds are nice, free wi-fi and internet and decent view over this new area of the city. Great location and nice to have additional dining and entertainment options in the nearby mall. The area is geared towards the expatriate community and the stores / restaurants reflect this (carrefour grocery store, irish pub, etc...) "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"chid design hotel in Pudong I stayed here on July 07 for Propak Exhibition and hotel is a very good location for the New Exhibition Center.Rooms are very nice decorated with a touch, large and comfortable, see my pictures where you will see glass wall between bath and bedroom.Location is good for business especially for exhibitions but take care because taxi drivers have problems sometime in getting you there.A plus is the mall and shops connected to the hotel as written in other reviews: many restaurants for dinner options (Japanese, CHinese, Indian, Pizza Hut, Italian...) and good to have there a Carrefour supermarket, a beauty parlor and massage center where for 20 € you can have a 2 hours oil massage.NEGATIVE: gym is lower level than good Radisson hotels and even if it is equipped with latest Technogym treadmills (my opinion best machines for that) something is missing.More negative hotel has no steam bath, pools for cooling down and just a small sauna inside man's bath, no relaxation area after sauna. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Great Hotel Radisson in Pudong Shanghai, is a great hotel to stay at for Business travelers, and tourists.It's a short taxi to the subway. Great price for a real modern, clean hotel. Nearby there is Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and great restaurants. I recommend this to anyone who does not want to get ripped off in Shanghai with over priced hotels.The photos online are really the way the hotel looks, no surprises. Its beautiful. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Very Modern Decor I stayed at the Radisson Pudong on a recommedation from a business colleague. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel decor is very modern. The hallways are very dark. But once you get to the room, it is a different story. The walls are pure white. All of the furniture is white and smooth. The bathroom is small, but it feels more spacious because there is a glass wall where it adjoins the room. It probably sounds creepier than it is. If you are staying in the room with another person, there is a shade that you can put down. I was by myself, so it really didn't matter.There are several restaurants in the hotel. I ate a dinner a couple of times in the restaurant on first floor and had dim sum in the restaurant on third floor. There are also many restaurants and shops in the area next to the hotel. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Designer chic and good all-round service Stayed here for a week on business. Most of the other reviews have said it all already, but I can confirm their impressions - a chic, designer hotel with good service.Another plus, depending on your point of view, is the location. It's situated close to various restaurants and shops which are in part tailored to the visiting western businessman. There is a big choice of Chinese restaurants with menus in English as well as Chinese, and also restaurants with other cuisines. I would not really recommend the hotel's restaurants - they are vastly overpriced, and in the case of the European-style one, just not good.At the weekend I went to Century Park and watched people flying kites- not a bad way of passing the time if you are jet-lagged and can't be bothered going somewhere in particular. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Excellent Definitely stay at this hotel again if I go to Shanghai. Loved the modern, chic design. Enjoyed so much that I decided to take the time to write a hotel review first time ever. Previous stays at the likes of Four Seasons, St. Regis, Marriott, etc. in many parts of the world didn't prompt me to.I checked in late in the evening, greeted by polite, professional staff at the reception. They were very apologetic for the 3 minutes I was waiting for another guest checking in. Waiting for 3 mins and staff kept saying &quot;sorry&quot; -- that' pretty rare in the mainland. Then I was offered a free upgrade to a suite. (I booked on the hotel's website as they offered special deal for HK$680/night + 15%.) Room is spacious, clean, white and light tone, design is simple yet elegant, comfortable bed. Very quiet -- extra points given for this because it can be very annoying when you find yourself constantly hearing what people next door is doing, even at high-end luxury hotel. This problem absolutely doesn't exist in the rooms here. One flat panel TV in the living room and another one in the bedroom. There's just one thing I didn't like -- one of the corners of the bathroom walls were part made of glass, which means if you share the room with a friend it's embarrassing. Even after pulling down the curtain they are still not entirely covered. Pretty annoying. Oh well, the bathtub and separate shower and a ceiling decorated with paintings compensated for part of that. There's an iron and iron board in one of the closets for those who care. Shoe shine service means leaving your shoes in the basket inside the closet and the cleaning lady polishes them for you. Not the professional kind of shoe shining service you'd expect from Four Seasons.Windows overlooking mainly newly built apartment buildings, from one side I could see a church, from another side I could see the &quot;Big Thumb Square.&quot;Speaking of the Square -- That's a good reference point when talking to cab drivers. At the square, there are also quite a few restautants -- First you'll see one claim to offer Hong Kong cuisine (didn't try so can't comment whether it's authentic or not);Opposite to it is an Indian one (I did see Indian people eating in there and Indian chefs working inside);Then a couple of Japanese one;Two Korean restuarants;Shanghainese, Northeast Chinese,Hong Kong style seafoodPizza Hut,Another pizza fastfood place,HaagendazStarbucksHong Kong style dessert placeTwo western bakeriesAnd there's Carrefour supermarket (opens until 10 p.m.)There's an open area where locals/tourists hang out until after 10 pm. Nice if you like outdoor cafe as there's one at the center.There are also about four restaurants inside the hotel. I tried the one of 3rd floor serving Cantonese cuisine. Modern design, tasty food, well, not the kind of top-notch Cantonese restaurants where you can find a big variety of delicate dishes, but simple black pepper beef stir fry dish and &quot;special&quot; fried rice do taste good. There's also all-you-can-eat dim sum lunch but didn't try.Breakfast room service -- congee not tasty. There's a cafe that offers sandwiches/pastries/coffee at the hotel. Just turn left after you leave the hotel foyer. Next to it is *MY FAVOURITE* fruit store! Great variety of higher-than-average quality fruits. Not easy to find in the mainland, especially that close to a hotel. Open till 12 midnight. Not the cheapest you can get but it caught my eyes the moment I passed by the hotel for the first time.There are also a hair salon, massage place -- Just turn right after coming out of the hotel, it's a two-minute walk at most. The salon charged 38 yuan for blow dry. They'd ask which type of shampoo you want. I asked what's the difference between the two that they offered and was told one is the regular with no extra charge, another one adds extra moisture and cost 20 yuan more. I chose the latter just to make myself feel &quot;safer&quot; as you really don't know what would be in the &quot;regular&quot; one. There's also a hair salon inside the hotel, but I called to make a reservation in the morning, was told to come after 5 mins. I did. Then the lady there asked me to wait for another 5 mins. I did again. When I returned, she said the stylist is on his way coming from the building at the back (apparently the hotel provides residence for its staff). I didn't want to waste any more time waiting so I left. Still that lady was very polite and kept apologizing. Broadband in the room was complimentary. Had a bit of trouble connecting initially. A manager and a tech staff came up 10 mins after I called for help and fixed it. This review is getting too long so I better round up soon. Just have to say it one more time the staff are highly professional -- One of them spotted my taxi bill when he opened the door for me and asked where I came from. I was puzzled at first but he quickly explained it normally shouldn't cost that much: the meter showed my bill was more than 150 yuan. I told him I went to some very remote places and he was relieved. Can you believe these front door staff can be so attentive and care about their customers? Another staff reminded me to ask the driver for a receipt because if there's anything wrong I can file a compaint. These staff are unbelievable -- SUPER!!OK, I'm calling this place my home in Shanghai. Only thing you need to think about is it's on Pudong side, where the international airport and new business district is. It takes longer to go to Puxi (xi=west, dong=east) where the Bund and XinTianDi are located. Depends on what your priorities are. I stayed at the legendary Peace Hotel, left after one night because it's old and stuffy, stayed at JinMao Grand Hyatt, enjoyed it but the staff are cold and indifferent. Stayed at one of the Jin Jian hotels, cost more than 800 yuan/night but nowhere close to what I get from Radisson Pudong. Good luck! "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Quite Nice ! Stayed here for a mini break. Nice hotel, lovely lobby, modern interiors. Rooms were spacious which was great ! Cool design of the Bathroom, where there was a panel of glass from the Bedroom. Service levels good, with most speaking english.Not bad spread for breakfast on the western side. Chinese side not that impressive. It is slightly out from central. Two options, take the metro from Century Park, takes about 10 mins into the Shanghai Telecom Tower. Cab ride to the metro from hotel is about 10 mins.Or take the cab straight to Central i.e. Bund etc. This wil take longer about 20-30 mins depending on the traffic (and driver !!! Yes, they are quite mad out there, like in Formula 1)Overall quite nice !Must try the Massage Salon close to the Hotel. Took my wife and had a great foot massage after a heavy day of sightseeing and very reasonable and open till 1am ! "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Would definitely stay there again We stayed at this hotel late Jan/early Feb and found it great. Our flight arrived early but they were very obliging and let us in to the room early. Room and bathroom (separated only by a glass wall) were very spacious, had everything we needed and the beds were very comfortable. The staff were most helpful. My husband was disappointed in the breakfast so thereafter we walked round the corner to a beautiful bakery - too tempting!A quick taxi ride to the metro and then everywhere you wanted to go easily accessible. Do make sure you have the destination written in Chinese for the taxi driver or ask the hotel staff to inform them. "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,Wonderful Experience Just came back from a week in this Hotel. I was visiting for a conference that is held every two years. This Hotel has everything the traveller could ask for excellent Internet access in room for free and a great modern Gym for fittness. The staff are warm and welcoming and 95% of them speak excellent English.Large Luxury Rooms. This is the best Hotel experience I have had in 7 years of business travel in China. Highly Recommended. 
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"Radisson Pudong - excellent! We have just returned from staying at this hotel for a conference and found it an excellent choice. It was new, edgy modern, great service and whilst we didnt use the restaurants the breakfast was also excellent . being on Pudong side of the river was no problem and perhaps even a positve (quiet at night) as it was only a 15min walk to the easiest of metro services that I have ever used or a 10min taxi trip to the CBD "
radisson hotel pudong century park ,"brand new great modern Just return the other day, and this hotel needs a good review, since I was very impressed by this hotel! The price-quality ratio is more than perfect, I paid a little over 50 €uro per night for a Deluxe Room (without breakfast), which is excellent deal. The room has eveything which one needs, even broadband internet is included in the room price. The bathroom is bright and modern and the rain shower is an enjoyment itself. The large room is equiped with flat screen TV, so everything realy is top-end! Overall the service throughout the hotel is also fine. The only thing which was annoying was the very loud kitchen fan, so get a table for breakfast away from the open kitchen with the Asian food. For someone who is looking for a modern hotel at a great price, got to the Radisson Hotel in Pudong! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"EXcellent hotel and Location location! I stayed for six nights in the Radisson New World.LOCATION: Excellent: on Peoples's Square, across the Metro station ( three lines ), near several shopping streets and within walking distance of Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai Urban Planning Center and Grand Theatre. The hotel is connected to the department store New World City and East Nanjing Road can be reached via an underground passage.ROOMS: I had a small suite with view on People's Square. Rooms are tastefully decorated and the bathrooms are spacious.STAFF: All the staff were friendly and efficient and went out of their way to help. When I lost my videocamera the Duty Manager arranged for an English speaking employee to go with me to the police station. Apparently the station had just moved to a new location, so he had to ask around in the neighbourhood. He not only translated, but convinced the police officers who at first didn't want to make an official report to do so.I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Shanghai! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Awesome hotel Beautiful 5-star hotel, great entertainment and excellent customer service. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,Beautiful hotel watch for solicitations in lobby Beautiful hotel. Rooms are spacious and clean. The lobby is accomodating and clean as well but I saw several women in the lobby who were looking for customers. The buffet offered a large selection of both western foods and eastern foods as well. The restaurant staff was a bit rude though. They seemed to believe we were bringing in more people than we had chits for. The view from the bar at the top was beautiful. 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great hotel great location Situated at the end of Nanjing East Rd (large shopping strip), across the road from People's Square (large parkland) and with convenient access the 3 metro lines, this hotel is in a first class position. The hotel is well maintained and well staffed. The gym/pool facilities are excellent.The bar on level 45 is worth the trip, but whilst the views are spectacular, I felt it lacked some atmosphere. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Nice Hotel but Overpriced - Excellent Staff Mostly. LOCATION - The Radisson is situatied at People's Square in Shanghai, across the street from the metro, and at the beginning of Nanjing Road walking street. Just around the corner is the hit-and-miss food street. It is about 30 minutes by taxi from the high-speed train (Maglev) and about 20 minutes by subway. The Bund is about a 20-25 minute walk - they say 15 minutes, but you'd have to be really hustling. It's not super close, it takes some effort to get there. There are high end shopping malls all around, a Starbucks is just across the park (note they don't open until 7:30 AM). The hotel is connected to a shopping mall. Overall, a good location in Shanghai we thought, as long as you're comfortable riding the metro.ROOM - We had a superior room on the 28th floor. The view would have been very nice except the windows were filthy - they looked like they hadn't been washed in months. After some inquiries we found they only wash the outside of the windows every 3 months. Too bad, it really made a difference with our view. Le Meridien is nearby - I bet they have clean windows. If you get there just after they wash the windows, the view from the high floors is very nice - neon lights, and the Nanjing Road Pedestrian street. The room itself is nice, but pretty average considering the price. 300 SF - other hotels in the area are bigger for around the same price. However, unlike those hotels, the Radisson includes free high speed internet in your room, so you have to factor that into the cost. The beds were Tempur-Pedic Swedish mattresses, very comfortable. No flat-screen TV which seemed odd for this price range. Cable TV Channels including CNN, HBO, MAX and a few other English channels. Nice bathroom with retractable privacy screen. Small desk. No specific complaints about the room - was comfortable if not special.STAFF - We found the staff to be excellent. They were always doing whatever they could to assist us. The concierge even accompanied us to a laundromat where we could do laundry (we had a long trip, and a lot of laundry - would have cost a fortune to do it in the hotel). Manager was helpful and tried to help, restaurant staff always making a very concerted effort. Good English at the hotel for the mostly Western guests. The only exception was a pretty shameful incident at the lobby bar, where they served us red wine that had been sitting out for a few days, and it had gone bad - tasted like vinegar. We sent it back, and they poured us out of a new bottle that was much better. However, later, they poured the new bottle into the old bottle, combining them, and then served us the combination, hoping that we wouldn't notice. Of course, it was terrible, and when we asked to see the bottle, we could see it was the original one, only full now instead of mostly empty. We called them on it, and they were embarrassed - not that they'd done that, but that they'd been caught. After much negotiation, they at least finally took the last glass of wine off our bill, but it required so much effort, it wasn't worth it. Other than that, the staff was very well trained and concerned for the guests.SERVICES - There is a very expensive rotating restaurant on the 45th floor that offers great views and very expensive, mediocre food. On the 47th floor, there is a Sky Bar that features live bands that spend more time on break than playing, and obstructed views of the city. There is a Chinese Restaurant downstairs that we didn't try, and a Buffet restaurant of mediocre quality and high prices as well. Prices of Room Service, Mini-Bar, and other hotel services were ridiculously high for China. If you spend a lot of time eating and drinking at the hotel, you might want to look elsewhere. If you need a place to lay your head, then you're ok. Pool, Fitness Center, Spa, etc were available but we didn't try them.HOTEL OVERALL - Clean, fairly elegant, good staff (except bartender at lobby bar), comfortable place to stay. Shopping inside the hotel, and at attached mall. A few rough edges like the dirty windows and mediocre overpriced restaurants, but overall a good stay. I think we'd probably choose another hotel next time - we had two computers so the free high-speed internet was a great touch for us, the entire reason we chose this hotel over Le Meridien nearby. Keep in mind that if you visit on Chinese Holiday weeks, you'll be swarmed by people on Nanjing Road so bad that you'll just hole up in your hotel to hide. The Bund is under major construction right now, not even worth visiting. Should be done by March they say, so if that is one reason you're considering this location scratch that off your list. DINING NEARBY - We found Huang Ji Huang, a hole in the wall stewpot restaurant nearby to be tasty, though a rat ran through the dining area while we were eating. We didn't go for the dog meat or intestines, but the veggie stew with beef and three sauces was very tasty. Don't go to Yue Li Restaurant unless you want to be overwhelmed by smoke, garbage on the floors, bad service and disgusting greasy food. Another restaurant called Qian Long Mei Shi, across from Yue Li was very tasty. All these were very Chinese, with lots of duck heads, pig intestines, cow stomach, and king snake on the menu - if you like mostly Western food, or this is your first visit to China, you might want to start a little more touristy. There are plenty of more touristy options and hotel restaurants nearby. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent My mother and I stayed at the Radisson New World Hotel in August and it was fantastic.The location was fantastic – right at the start of the pedestrian walk of Nanjing Road. There is a metro station right in front of the hotel, however in Shanghai taxis are incredibly cheap and it were only ever 12-15RMB to any area we went to. You could always get a taxi from outside our hotel easily and we never got lost or had a bad experience.The staff were so nice and helpful. From the front desk staff to the guy at the pool, I could not fault them. The concierge were an incredible help and made our trip so much easier. They would book restaurants for us, organise a half day trip to Zhou Zhuang (water village) and wrote out addresses for us to give taxi drivers. Breakfast was included with our room and the buffet was very good. Plenty of fruit, pastries, juice, cereal, toast, dumplings, congee, rice, noodles, meats, cheeses, yogurt, pancakes and omelettes made to order. It definitely kept us going all day.The room was a good size and had an office attached which was a great place to store our bags and shopping. Our beds were turned down every night and chocolates left on our pillows. The bathroom contained every toiletry you could think of and the shower was incredible after a day of sightseeing in the heat and humidity. The room was very clean, great air-conditioning, lovely bed linen and they had thought of everything. There was also two TVs and a great view of the gardens.The pool was really nice and air-conditioned inside! Only had breakfast at the hotel, but we did have a drink in the sky dome bar. It was worth it to see the Filipino band who energetically pump out their mixture of blues, pop and classics. Complete with dance moves. It’s an experience and we had fun.Highlights of our time in Shanghai included a shopping tour (see Shopping Tours Shanghai in the Things to do in Shanghai section of this website), the Yuan Gardens, Taikang Road Art Centre (fantastic gift shops – unique items and little old shops in small alleys), cocktails at Cloud 9 bar in the Hyatt at Pudong, Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall and the acrobatics (Era – at CircusWorld. 7.30pm and the concierge can organise the tickets for you). Also recommend Lost Heaven, 1221 and Lynn for dinner. The Bund is currently closed for construction works in preparation for the Expo in 2010.I would definitely stay at this hotel again when I am next in Shanghai. I can’t fault it at all. Fantastic. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"'Great Hotel' We really enjoyed this hotel! The location was fantastic, as it was a walking distance from the museum and the main pedestrian street. We booked a superiior hotel with breakfast included and both the view of the city and the breakfast were amazing. The breakfast was probably one of the best I have ever had, with an enormous variety of choices. The pool was nice and warm and my six year old had a blast. Place was a great value. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Overrated We sampled three different &quot;five star&quot; hotels in Shanghai during the month of July. Our favorite was the Four Seasons, followed by the Portman Ritz Carlton. The Radisson New World was our least favorite. When we booked the hotel online, we got a very reasonable price, so we were pleased there. But what the hotel lost in room fees, it definitely made up in other charges. The restaurants were extremely high-priced and we suspect we got sick there, though we don't know for sure. The soup served downstairs in the &quot;coffee shop&quot; one day showed up exactly the same in the restaurant at the top of the hotel under a different name (a watery tasting chicken soup with peas). Also this hotel provided the least bottles of drinking water of any hotel I encountered. You had to ask for more, thus being tempted to dip into the high-priced bottle of Evian in the mini-bar (remember, the weather was very hot).Pluses of this hotel included: a nice view, a comfortable bed and an attractive room. The pool was quite nice, though the one at the Four Seasons was a little nicer. The main down side to this hotel were the food and water options. I also don't recall the reception as being very friendly or exceptionally helpful. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Nice but let down by the view Myself and my 5 year old daughter stayed in the Radisson New World for 4 nights in late July 2009 following a trip to see the 2009 solar eclipse out in the Pacific. I've stayed in Shanghai before (in the Sofitel), but this time was looking for a hotel with a swimming pool. I based my decision on reviews here.Firstly, the pool (and attached whirlpool) were excellent; super warm and uncrowded. Unfortunately the whirlpool was out of commission though for two days having some of it's tiles replaced.Secondly, prior to travelling, and again based on what I'd read here, the one thing I'd asked for was a &quot;room with a view&quot;. But despite booking a deluxe room with city view + breakfast, we ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the basketball court and the building site. This was disappointing and I have to say the views I had from the Sofitel were far, far better. The double tragedy here is that somewhere nearby and to the rear, night-time building work for Expo 2010 sometimes intruded on the slumber.As far as everything else goes; as reported, the Radisson has a central location, it's nice that it's attached to a shopping complex and metro. and although others had reported it, I couldn't detect any strange smells in either the room or the lobby. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Awesome view from restaurant on top! My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel nearby, but went for dinner at the restaurant on top of the Radisson Hotel to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The view was simply stunning! Definitely worth going there, staff was very friendly and food was delicious. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good Value Hotel Central Location Nice hotel, excellent location in the Center of Shanghai. Rooms are well appointed with everything needed, WiFi is included. Metro is easy to use, or taxis. Xintiandi is a good area with lots of restaurants nearby although a little pricey. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Okay to Good After staying in the most beautiful hotel in Beijing, of the same class, 5 star, this unfortunely was a let down! I could not fault it though in saying this.The pool, spa and gym were all up to my expectations, definately 5 star, however the rooms were not so great. Quite small, although we did only pay for a superior. Quite musty smelling. I am being picky, but these are things that I would have liked to read on tripadvisor before I had booked the hotel! I must add also that walking on the 1st floor from the business centre to breakfast buffet area, it smelt like sewrage! Don't know what it was! I am being extremely picky, it was definately nice and a pleasure to stay there but there are always pros and cons!We did complain about the mustyness and also that we weren't situated next to each other, there were 4 of us travelling together and we were at opposite ends of the same floor! They were lovely about this and upgraded us to a deluxe room and our friends the same, we ended up being next door! The deluxe room was still the same decore and only bigger because their was a seperate room (a study). Worked out well though and the staff were great, easy to talk to, english speaking. Great location. Probably wouldn't stay there again...would try and pick a different 5 star with just a little more luxury and plushness for the price we payed! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good Location good quality but too expensive. This is a good hotel. It has an excellent location with easy links to all the key sights and just a min walk to the metro. Friendly and helpful staff and nice room - but we were upgraded so that helps. Even so the price is high. This is a characteristic of Shanghai, but i would expect more for the money. Another small complaint would be the price of the restaurants and bars again massively inflated compared to elsewhere in china and even more so when compared to other major cities in South East Asia. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great location average hotel My daughter and I stayed here for four nights in June in a standard room overlooking the People's square. Although it was no single thing we encountered during our stay, both of us found this hotel to be our least favorite of the 4 hotels we stayed at in China during our trip. It was also the cheapest, so the comparison may not be fair.The room was on the smallish side for a hotel of this rating, nothing particulary special about the contents or layout. Noted that many of the prior favorable reviews came from upgraded rooms, so you may want to consider booking a better room than standard. The staff was ok, but not as friendly/helpful as we found at our other hotels. We did not eat at the hotel, as there are so many wonderful restaurants in Shanghai. I would note that the restaurants aimed more at Western tastes charged Western prices, whereas the highly rated Chinese restaurants were quite reasonable, if not cheap. The location is just as good as previous reviewers have noted, especially if you use the subway, as the People's Square directly across from the hotel has three major lines that can be accessed. The taxi's in Shanghai are not as efficient as in the other China cities we visited (dropped at wrong locations, several could not figure out where the Radisson was even when we showed them the hotel card with the address in Chinese), so I really recommend using the subway for sights near subway stops. Plus, with all the construction for the 2010 Expo, normally bad Shanghai traffic is even worse.Four star rating is derived primarly due to location, otherwise would have just been average "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"great location We stayed here for 3 nights, initial room was somewhat small and had tired furniture with a shower over the bath. To the credit of the staff when we asked could we have another more modern room with a seperate shower they obliged with no problem, just goes to show what happens if you ask nicely. Location is execellent, buffet breakfast in the restraunt is good with plenty of variety. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great location - great service The title says it all. The hotel is steps away from the Nanjing Road pedestrian mall, across the street from People's Square park (and several museums), attached to the New World Emporium shopping mall, and a block away from the subway. Service was great from the minute we walked in the door. We had booked our stay using Radisson reward points, but still got an upgrade to a very nice suite. Our room faced People's Square and the view from our room was gorgeous, especially at night. We had a large sitting area with half bath, and very large bedroom, plus full bath with separate tub and shower. We also received welcome flowers and fruit. Everything was beyond our expectation. Every employee we met bent over backward to respond to our needs, even the gift shop staff. ( FYI - their gift shop staff will barter - no need to pay what the price tag says!) We received the randomly generated Radisson survey when we got home and after returning it, received a thank-you email response from the hotel GM. As with most hotels, the restaurants are expensive. We did spring for a western breakfast (one of the the things our son misses the most...) and it was okay but very pricey. Also, remember this is China, so don't expect a good cup of coffee. There is a Breadtalk (which is a bakery chain with stores located throughout Asia) just a block or 2 away on the pedestrian mall, so we recommend that for really good pastries and great coffee. Delicious! Breakfast for 2 at a Breadtalk cost less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks. The Skydome bar is rather dated in decor, but the view is spectacular. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Very nice hotel! This place has all I demmand to a Hotel: friendly staff, very clean and lominous rooms, and a modern forniture. Location is very good, right ahead the 'golden mile' Nanjing Road. This good location becomes a problem sometimes: some guys fill ioffer you 'lady massage'. everyitme you enteri or leave the lobby . "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great location We had a MICE trip of 4 days &amp; stayed at Radisson Hotel Shanghai New World from 4th to 8th April, 2009. We were a group of 11 persons. We were offered a non alcoholic welcome drink on arrival with hot &amp; cold options. Checkin was quick. The best part was that 5 rooms were upgraded including mine. The rooms are spacious with a complete sete set of bathroom toiletaries. Nanjing street for shopping &amp; the subway station, peoples square are a stones throw away. This saves you a lot of time &amp; cost towards travel.The staff was very helpful &amp; fantastic housekeeping. The fresh milk in sufficient quantity was changed everyday. It was great watching HBO on the 32&quot; plasma TV. The hot water jacuzzi is really worth a try. The view from my room no. 3608 on the 36th floor was impressive. Lastly the Filipino band playing right till midnight at the revolving pub on the 45th floor was impressive.However this hotel is a bit expensive but worth the money. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"reliable quality no negative surprices but personal care Perfect location with excellent deluxe rooms and good services both for sports, relaxation and food.during the last year breakfast has improved tremendously and the lunch and dinner buffes are excellent, the sea-food extravaganza is worth every penny and more.Staff takes care, also in extraordinary situations like we encountered during our last stayyou will enjoy your stay at the Radisson New World!

radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A wonderful experience I am currently staying at the Radisson and cannot fault the hotel or the service that I have received while I have been here. My stay was initially scheduled for seven nights but has been extended while I have been here to fourteen nights, and I am very pleased that I am staying here. I booked a Club Room which provides access to the Club Lounge where breakfast is served in the mornings and then complimentary drinks and snacks between 5.30 and 7.30pm. The staff in the lounge are lovely and make you feel very welcome, even remembering each day what your order from the previous day was. I am a female travelling alone on business and feel very comfortable being here. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre with easy access to Nanjing Road. Some reviewers have commented on how the touts ruined their experience - I find that if you just shake your head politely they go away very quickly. I walked alone down to the Bund and did not feel intimidated or hassled at any point on the way there or back. My room is perfect - as per other travellers' reviews but without the outdated furniture or the strange smell. Everything in my room is in immaculate condition and the room smells very fresh and clean. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A good centrally located hotel in Shanghai My partner and I recently stayed at the Radisson Hotel Shanghai New World - A centrally located hotel in Shanghai.ROOMWe reserved a Superior Room in the Tower Wing, but upon arrival we were upgraded to a Deluxe Room (in the same Wing). The check-in was quick, efficient, friendly and they honoured our request for a room with views of Pudong. The room was quite spacious although a bit dark. It came with a big bathroom separated from the room by a wooden door. The room also had a separate work area with its own separate 28&quot; (or so) plasma television. The room had a very comfortable king-sized bed with a good size wardrobe, a big work table and (2) chairs, two speaker phones, an in-room safe as well as complimentary (but very slow at times) high-speed LAN and wireless Internet service. There was also a 32&quot; regular television in the sleeping area of the room (with CNN, BBC News, NHK, as well as movie channels) but there was no DVD player. Also in the room was a fully stocked minibar with snacks, tea making facilities, as well as a reading chair with a Radisson Hotel magazine. By the bed, there were electronic controls which control the lights, and the DO NOT DISTURB sign outside the door of room. The bed was quite comfortable and with the turn down service in the evening, came two complimentary bottles of (350 mL Radisson branded) mineral water and two chocolates. While the room was quite spacious, the furniture was showing signs of wear and tear. The windows were quite filthy (from the outside) but the room itself was spotless and housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning it each day. There was however an odd musty/smoky smell in the air which one eventually gets used to.BATHROOMOn the whole, the bathroom was great: There was a sink, a spacious shower stall which came with Radisson's own ASiRA amenities and a massage head shower, as well as a separate soaking tub. There were also the usual extra amenities such as toothbrushes, hand-creams, etc. The toilet was enclosed in a separate corner of the bathroom and had its own phone. There were also plenty towels for use. There was also a window in the bathroom that overlooked the bedroom - There were blinds for privacy. The drainage of the sink and the shower was rather slow which led both to be slightly flooded. It wasn't a serious problem, but I think that they need to clean the drains soon before it becomes an issue. The water that came out of the faucet had a slight yellow tinge to it, so avoid drinking it.HOTEL FACILITIESThe hotel offered a variety of facilities which were all quite good. There was a heated indoor pool, fitness facilities and a VITA spa (The pool and the fitness facilities were complimentary for all guests). There were also shower facilities, a jacuzzi (for men only) and dry and steam saunas at the gym along with lockers. There was an attendant at the entrance of the facility but there was no life guard on duty at the indoor pool. There were also other facilities which I didn't use: A Mahjong Parlour, a squash room and pool tables but one must pay to use these facilities. There was also a Business Centre and Travel Agency in the hotel. The design of the hotel attempts to be luxurious but look a bit tacky in my opinion: There was an overuse of moulding, jade, fake Ming Vases and gold leaf everywhere! But then again, most Shanghai hotels were designed in this over-the-top manner!RESTAURANTAs for dinning options, there were three restaurant in the hotel, a lobby lounge and a bar (Skydome Bar) located on the top floor of the hotel. We didn't go to the bar, but we did dine at Epicure on 45 which was the hotel's revolving restaurant. The food and service were both alright, but you will be paying mostly for the views. Our room came with complimentary breakfast at the Windows on the Park restaurant. The breakfast selection was big with Western, Middle Eastern, Chinese and Japanese selections. The service at Windows was haphazard at times - The waiters rarely replenished our tea or coffee and the egg station chefs were sometimes quite slow in making the eggs - My partner had to stand by the station a good five minutes before he was served his eggs. Also, the food selection didn't change during our stay so we eventually ate elsewhere!SERVICEOverall, the service of the hotel was excellent: From the front desk staff to the concierge to the housecleaning staff there were no service-related problems. In fact, with the exception of the staff in the restaurants, the staff were not only courteous and always smiling but they went out of their way to help you. Communicating in English was not a problem at all. SURROUNDINGSThe hotel is in the downtown core of Shanghai, right on East Nanjing Road and across from People's Square. The hotel is connected to the New World Shopping Centre and the Shanghai Metro (subway) via an underground route. The Bund is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel and has a lot of wonderful (but a bit pricy) dinning options. Try M on the Bund's Sunday fry-up! To the south of the hotel, one can find The People's Square (Renmin Square) - a large park with numerous museums. There were also numerous shopping and (more affordable) dinning options in the New World Shopping Centre. The only problem I encountered was that there were numerous touts right outside the doors of the hotel who tried to hawk everything from fake designer bags and watches to women. This can be quite a nuisance and they don't easily take no for an answer! CONCLUSIONThe Radisson is a good five star-rated hotel with good facilities, but it's not perfect. The haphazard service in the restaurants and the annoying touts outside the hotel diminish an otherwise excellent experience. I do however recommend the Radisson for its location, good rooms and price. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Location My wife and I stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to China. The first time was for 4 nights, then again for 5 nights.The location is excellent, it is just a minutes walk from Nanjing Pedestrian Street and right across from People's Park and underground metro. It is also located next to several malls and restaurants. Even a starbucks thats in New World Mall (can enter the mall from the hotel lobby) or the Starbucks in People's Park.The breakfast was not worth the money charged and therefore we only ate once. There was plenty of (obviously) Chinese foods and East Asian, but not too much Western Food. Room service was very fast and not too reasonable, but good food.The view from the room was beautiful, on the first stay we had the Park view and on the second stay we had a view of Nanjing and the Pudong skyline. Both really nice.The rooms were of quality furniture but really dated. I can imagine it looked real nice when first opened, but now needs new furniture.Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, from reception to concierge to bellboys. There is an Australian supervisor who is there most days of the week, even though everyone else speaks excellent English. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Very nice hotel good (and bad) location A very nice hotel. I had a room overlooking people square that was excellent. Very centrally located, nearby some excellent shopping centres (try the food court of the 5th floor of Raffles Plaza - not the one on the ground floor). Also excellent location for the metro. My only gripe is the area is full of people hassling you in the street, to the point where you feel pestered. As soon as you step out of the hotel you get offered 'massage by pretty girl', watches, iphones, and of course the well documented Shanghai scam where you get approached by good looking young women who ask you if you can help them improve their English. Google for the rest of the story! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"One of the best choices in Shanghai We spent three nights in the Radisson. This was our first contact with Chinese hotels and made an excellent impression. We had booked a special offer for a Suite on the 35th floor, which included pick-up service at the airport (a relief after 12 hours of flight), fresh fruits daily in the room, english newspaper, free internet, etc. Everything was perfectly organized!I can only confirm the positive comments of other fellow travelers regarding convenient location, friendliness and competence of the staff and cleanliness of the rooms. I would add that the suite we got - although not overlooking Renmin Square, but the less appealing backside, heavily under construction - was very pleasant, quiet and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom functional.While the buffet breakfast was rich and of excellent quality, the buffet dinner was less exciting. However this did not alter our general very positive impression. Anyway, if you are in Shanghai, you should not have dinner in a hotel but go out and look for genuine Chinese cuisine!!! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good value for fantastic location I stayed 3 very pleasant nights at the Radisson New World for business and I was quite pleased with my stay. I found a rate through Expedia for just over $200/night including all taxes and surcharges. It's not a super luxury 5-star hotel on a par with, say, the Mandarin Oriental, but given that the location is as perfect as you can get in this sprawling, congested town, and that the rooms were clean and efficient, the value for money paid was outstanding. I would heartily recommend the hotel to other travelers of all sorts, besides perhaps those with incredibly deep pockets who need world-class luxury.My room was clean, well appointed, and comfortable. Some have said the rooms were perhaps dated, but that was not my experience. The furniture was nice-looking and comfortable, the bed was plush and inviting, and the bathroom's granite sinktop was sturdy and luxurious. One of my favorite features was a double glass wall between the bathroom shower and the bedroom with a motorized venetian blind between the panes. This allowed privacy if you wanted it, but it also let me shower in full morning sunlight whilst being able to enjoy my commanding 23rd floor city view. In my case, both wired and wireless internet access were free and suitable if not blazing fast.I have traveled frequently to Shanghai and tried a lot of hotels; none has matched the fantastic location of the Radisson. Set right on People's Square, busy Shanghai is right at the front doorstep. The proximity of several malls, a Starbucks, and several other coffee shops and restaurants are a blessing for those who don't want to eat massively overpriced hotel breakfasts (or other meals). The head of E. Nanjing Rd., a pedestrian shopping street, is just steps away. At the other end of Nanjing Road, just a pleasant (if touristy) walk, lies the Bund with its great views and bustle of activity. People's Park is a great place for a walk or just some relaxation, and the Shanghai Museum is also set on the park. Shopping street Huaihai Lu is walkable from the hotel. Central driving artery Yan'An Lu is also close by, making points further west and east, like Pudong, accessible by vehicle. The central location is all you can ask for if you want to see a lot of Shanghai.I am not a heavy user of hotel services, so I am not usually the best indicator of how friendly the spa and restaurant staff are. Still, my somewhat limited interactions with staff were generally pleasant and up to the standards of a modern international hotel. I did order an airport transfer from Hongqiao airport, which was an embarrassing rookie mistake. The price was more than double the taxi ride I took out of Shanghai for the longer drive to Pudong Airport. But the concierge was later excellent in helping me procure an independent car service for a day's travel to Suzhou, even sending someone up to my room to take a business card so they could pinpoint my destination. Bellhops were convenient and helpful, there at the right times without being obtrusive or grabby as is often the case in this part of the world. Front desk staff were excellent, including the very pretty Japanese manager who checked me out with a big smile. The hostess in the roof restaurant was very accommodating in letting me have a walk around to enjoy the view without sitting for a meal. I even found some of the maids spoke some English. I second some of the reviews that say you must have (exactly one) drink at the bar on the 47th floor. The band is so awful it is a must-see; the unintentional comedy is worth the stiff price of a single nightcap.As a business traveler who has appointments all over Shanghai, but who also wants to be able to enjoy myself during my free time, I have stayed in 10 different hotels in 10 different trips to this city. On my next trip back, the Radisson will be my first repeat. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"It was good not mind blowingly fantastic but solid We stayed here for three nights.The location of the Radisson Hotel is fantastic, right opposite Remin Square, and you can't miss it due to the big dome on the building. Its within walking distance of the Shanghai Museum and East Nanjing Road, where there are lots of shops and malls to browse in.We were a little disappointed with the room however. We got upgraded upon arrival which was a great surpise, but when we got in we felt the decor was a little lacking and dated, and the room was smaller than we thought (admittedly due to the layout). However it was clean and we even got a turndown service at night.The staff were helpful, although some of the English wasn't great, they were generally comprehendible.The top floor bar is something else! The Filipino band that played there has to be seen to be believed (and we don't mean in a good way :)). They certainly could change this area to make it a bit funkier, but that's just an opinion.So overall, the Radisson is a solid, dependable hotel, but I do think it is in need of a bit of a makeover. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great hotel! Haven't been in a big chain hotel in a long while after discovering boutique hotels. This is a good surprise. Very clean, nice rooms, excellent service. Great heated pool! Must commend the concierge staff as they were helpful through our whole stay. The hotel bar at the top of the hotel is quite cheesy and would recommend drinks at the lobby instead. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Maybe expected a bit more??? Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the hotel but in comparison to other 5 star hotels I've stayed in in Asia it was nothing special, or nothing to rave about. After looking at photos of the hotel I was expecting something great but was a little dissappointed. As other reviewers have stated, the hotel and rooms were very clean. I didn't find the staff at reception to be overly friendly and when I tried to find out where to dine I was told were the tourists usually go which was not really what I wanted. The Australian girl at reception was very nice and helpful.The location was ok, it was a bit of a walk to get anywhere although it is near a metro station. We had dinner at one of the restaurants one night and the chinese food seemed very westernised and it was very expensive (expected). I think I would book somewhere else next time. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Best hotel stay in China The Radisson Shanghai was simply great all around. When we were checking in, we met a young woman who was interning at the hotel from Australia. From then on, she was always ready to help answer questions, find restaurants, provide travel advice and help out with tickets. If not for her we would not have gone to the Olympic football game at the Shanghai stadium. She also helped us figure out tickets to Suzhou. Also at check-in, we were upgraded to a suite on the 26th floor facing the Pearl Tower. What a view! Quite amazing. We could see the Pudong and beyond. The room was super clean and comfortable with turn down service at night. The hotel location is probably its best amenity. Right across from the People's Square, 2 min walk to the metro, 5 min walk to Nanjing rd markets, near a Starbucks (yes Starbucks is important) and walking distance to the Pudong. Basically amazing. The only thing that could be improved is the breakfast. It's quite expensive for China - 200RMB and just wasn't anything special. However, the bar on top of the hotel was great with great drinks and live entertainment. If I go to Shanghai again, I would stay at this hotel and this hotel only! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Nice hotel fabulous location After nine days at the Olympics in Beijing, my husband and I dragged our two kids, ages 4 and 15 months, down to Shanghai for two days because I was dying to see how the town had changed since we lived there in 2003. We had major pangs of regret as we left Beijing -- we couldn't remember why we had decided to abandon the Olympics, a free room at the JW Marriott, and our trusted, Mandarin-speaking babysitter in Beijing. My husband was freaking out all the way down to Shanghai. Then we arrived at the Radisson New World and breathed a sigh of relief. Shanghai is awesome, and the Radisson New World is a lovely hotel in a GREAT location. Some people may be overwhelmed by the crazy scene, but I felt a rush the minute we stepped out of the underground passage that leads directly from the hotel onto the pedestrian stretch of Nanjing Donglu (via the New World mall). We were in a &quot;Deluxe City View Room.&quot; It consisted of two rooms, which was GREAT for the kids. We could stash them in the bedroom at nap- and bedtime and still work or watch TV in the small office area. I could see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the office window -- a wonderful view of the tower &amp; Nanjing Rd. at night! The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, big bathtub and separate toilet area. Furnishings were nice, although not super-deluxe. We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was very good -- huge American-style offerings at a fairly reasonable price. The pool is lovely -- it is indoors, but on the top of the lower building so that there is a glass roof over it. There is also an outdoor patio area adjacent to the pool. The pool has an attached whirlpool which the kids LOVED. If you are traveling with picky-eating kids, as I was, you will probably appreciate the very easy access to western fast food in the subterranean level of the adjacent New World Mall. The room service food was also very good. We had Shanghai noodles and one other Chinese dish one night and they were both great. However, one of three hiccups was the room-service hamburger. I ordered it cooked medium for the kids and it came very rare. When I complained the manager took the charge off my bill and sent us a complimentary fruit plate. GREAT! We had two other problems, neither major. One is that the room was not that clean. I found an empty soda bottle behind the curtains on our second day there -- it preceded our arrival! There was also trash (a used drinking straw and LOTS of lint) under the lip of the bed. Yuck. The second was the the shower was incredibly slow draining, so I was standing in nearly 2 inches of water by the end of my shower. Also kind of yuck. We had called ahead from Beijing to have the hotel van pick us up at Hongqiao airport. The price was 500 RMB, which is insanely high, but I did not want to fool around with finding a taxi van while herding two spazzy children. When we left Shanghai we paid 280 RMB for a taxi van to take us to Pudong airport. I still think it was worth the extra bucks (I mean RMB) to have the guy from the hotel waiting for us at baggage claim (with name sign) to take us right to our van. Again, I want to emphasize how wonderful the location was. We walked to the Bund our first night, then the next day stepped right onto a subway to go over to the Aquarium (first stop in Pudong). I loved walking around Nanjing Road -- so easy to entertain the kids! At first my daughter was put off by the swarm of vendors, but we taught her to say &quot;bu yao&quot; and then it became a fun game for her to shoo them away cheerfully. If we had stayed longer I'm sure we would have appreciated the proximity (across the street) to Renmin Park, but we didn't end up getting there. (First-time visitors to SH should definitely check out the Shanghai Museum in Renmin Park!) I would DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again, and in fact I can't wait!! Radisson New World, hen hao! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Lovely!! This is a magnificent hotel in a perfect location. The rooms were impeccable! I stayed here for business on 2 occasions within 2 weeks for a few nights each time. I had a suite one stay and a regular double room the next, and I was very impressed with the decor and details. I loved the whirlpool bath, the beautiful beds and linens, and the views are spectacular. Each stay I was above the 20th floor, and it was really beautiful. The location is perfect for walking and shopping, and although I didn't eat in the hotel facilities, I assume they were up to the other standards. The staff was friendly and helpful, and they had excellent English. They assisted with booking trains, stored some bags for me, and made other good recommendations. Unfortunately the pool was closed for repairs during my stay, but it couldn't be helped as it was from unexpected storm damage, and notices were posted conveniently for the guests. I will return again, for sure! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"pretty good hotel pretty good hotel, but i can't say much b/c i've never stayed at a 5* beforee. stayed two nights in august and found all the workers very welcoming. some workers had pretty good english but a few need to brush up and imrpove their accents hahaa. after i checked out the third day i left my baggage at the concierge till around 5pm, and they happily did it for me. oh the first morning someone knocked and asked if our room's been cleaned. i guess that's nice of them butt if i wanted to sleep in that woulda been kinda bothersome. we used the sauna and swimming pool in the mornings and there were barely any ppl so that was greatt. the pool's nice but some of the tiles on the sides are coming off! be careful not to chip them out when u're sitting on it and moving or whatever. there's a patio-ish place by the swimming pool and it woulda been nice if the view was better, buildings next to (or part of?) the hotel were blocking the sides =[they play soothing music and the design looks wonderful soo it's definitely a relaxing place =]oh and for the whirlpool, don't forget to press a button on the side outside for the bubbles to come out. it wasn't very warm water, almost the same as the swimming pool cuz they're connected. amenities include 2 bottles of water a day/shampoo/conditioner/bath salt/bath gel?/body wash/comb/shower cap/nail filler/cotton balls/toothbrush&amp;paste/slippers/lotion/sink&amp;bathsoaps/bathrobes/etc..there were alott of white businessppl i thinkk.we went up to the 45th floor to take a look but didn't eat there, and the views were prettyyy nice! i think it'd be better if it were at night and started revolving too (we went in the morning before they started lunch). rooms were of decent size. ask for a higher floor to get a better view! i think we were in the back thoughh so we overlooked alot of low and old homes.. so perhaps facing nanjing road would be better? altho undoubtedly a bit louder..OHHH and i didn't mention about the location.. it's pretty much perfectt! right across from the metro (be careful crossing the street..u'll know how perrilous chinese traffic is when u get there) and directly connects to the shanghai new world shopping center. when u go through the door u'll immediately meet like 2 or 3 chinese banks.. i think exchanging money at a bank gives a better rate than the hotel soo go there! u can also get to the subway thru the shanghai new world center, but the directions might be a bit confusing. taxis are abundant on nanjing road and are CHEAPP! subways are cheap too but crowded at times so if u don't wanna be stuck next to sweaty ppl (the summer weather sucks) go for the taxi lol..i would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel if u're a tourist!! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,Great central Location. This is a great central location and an oasis especially after 7 days travelling in the Chinese countryside. 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A Great Choice for Exploring Shanghai For a first visit to Shanghai and after a good deal of research (including on Trip Advisor) we decided on the Radisson New World primarily for its location. In fact, we got a fabulous location and much more. The airport “meet and greet” included in our package was smooth and very welcome, and we were greeted upon arrival by a very pleasant young Australian management intern. Our Deluxe City View room was clean, modern, well-equipped, quiet and comfortable. The buffet meals overlooking People’s Square were fabulous, and it was a pleasure to sample a great variety of foods while checking e-mail on the hotel’s Wi-Fi which came in strong in the restaurant. The Food and Beverage Manager was on several occasions unusually friendly and hospitable. The concierge staff- whose services we required frequently- was also efficient and helpful.But best of all was indeed the location. The Radisson NW is perfectly located, Nanking Road, the other main shopping streets leading to the Bund, the Bund itself, the sites and activity of People’s Square, many historic preservation buildings and the current iteration of the knock-off market were all an easy walk. We had to take cabs to many sites, but a great deal of what Shanghai has to offer was within a half hour’s walk.The Radisson was also well-located for a very informative and worthwhile historic preservation tour we took provided by the Shanghai Historic House Association. Highly recommended for those interested in the Old Shanghai and its architecture.A foot note. Returning to Shanghai after an excursion to Hangzhou, we had (for a change of ambiance) reserved at an old villa in the French Concession turned into a boutique B&amp;B called “The Nine.” We found it colorful but cursed with the hardest bed we’ve ever run across, noisy due to all-night construction and a bit less than sparklingly clean. After one night we headed back to the Radisson- sans reservation- and it was like coming home again.Next time in Shanghai, we won’t have to think twice about where to stay. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Modern functional good location and great value Good hotel: fast, efficient staff at reception, nice rooms, comfortable beds, modern and large bathrooms. Excellent location with subway and underground line at People's Square. Also very good restaurants with an international food selection to suit everyones taste. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Hotel and Location This hotel is located across from the People's Square/Park. Very conveniently located. For a chain hotel- it was top notch. We were upgraded to a suite w/ a view overlooking all the action of the park. The subway was across the street- 30 minute walk to the Bund. Breakfast not included in our price, but was very affordable and good. Did not dine in the other restaurants. The concierge was wonderful- booked airfare, and train tickets for us. Very efficient. Rooms are clean, and spacious. No problems. Highly recommended. Chose this hotel based on reviews and location. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great central hotel A great hotel... we chose this hotel mainly based on price compared to the much more expensive Hyatt &amp; Shangri -La.I have no complaints about this hotel, services are excellent, cleanliness and rooms great.We stayed on the club level which gave breakfast and a 'happy hour' (2 hours!) of free snacks and drinks in the early evening.Views from the rooms are amazing, we could see the Oriental Pearl Tower and down and through the Nanjing Rd.Great location, on the Nanjng Rd (a nightmare for being hassled to buy &quot;bags, watches&quot;, be ready with the phrase 'Boo Yow' meaning not needed), a 10 minute walk to the Bund and the sightseeing tunnel(!!).Would recommend to anyone,, especially as a great substitute to the far more expensive versions in Pudong. Can't see that you'd get much more for your money in those hotels.... "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"The cleanest hotel in the world? Stayed, again, at the Radisson New World for a week while in China on business.The reception area is spotless, and the staff excellent. Check-in is very quick, and with multi-national staff on the desk, it is made very easy.Porters will take your bags up to your room, but if you don't want them to, just politely decline. All rooms are very comfortable. There are different grades of room, and if you are lucky enough to be upgraded, it just gets better.My room was upgraded to a suite that has an entrace/office area, including a Plasma screen. The bedroom has a king size bed, TV, drawers, etc. The bathroom was fab, with a huge bath, a walk-in shower and seperate, huge, toilet cubicle.Rooms are cleaned every day and with all major hotels, towels are changed when thrown in the bath/floor.Every part of the hotel is cleaned, cleaned and cleaned again. Even the ashtrays in the reception area (you can still smoke indoors) have a Radisson logo de-bossed in the sand! Fantastic.As with every good luck story, there is a but - the price of drinks in the lobby bar is very high, but not as high as the price in the Sky Dome bar on the 49th Floor. A great night of kitch, cheesy sing-along, but drinks are very expensive. As an example, 2 beers, a wine and a brandy &amp; coke cost well over £20.Breakfast is very good, but again, quite expensive - around £15. The choice is great and it is all you can eat, so enjoy.If you need any information about where places are and how to get to them, ask the concierge desk, they are very helpful and will ensure your taxi driver knows exactly where to take you.Taxis are very cheap, but always make sure you have the address written in Chinese as well as English (or whichever language you speak) so the driver can read it - most don't speak any other languages.Shanghai is a great city and the markets are a must for all bargain hunters. Food is great, and quite well priced, especially the food bars in the department stores up Nanjing Road. There are many bars to drink in, most of which are very westernised, have good beer on tap and pool tables - watch out for the Thai pool sharks - and company is never hard to find.Be warned, when out and about, especially in the evenings, and especially when you get back to the hotels, you will be approached by beggars. These beggars could be old ladies, men, or women thrusting their little baby children into you at 2am in the morning (so i am told!) just for a few RMB - do not give them anything or you will entire families chasing you down the road, or twice as many there the next nightWe visit Shanghai twice a year on business, and usually stay at the Radi because it's clean, and very comfortable - enjoy. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great stay at the Radisson new world I booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews. We went out for a business trip in May.The hotel is located on a great road ( west nanjing).Its a very central location to get to all the main attractions. We were collected from the airport and taken there but a taxi wouldn't be expensive to get you there.The hotel gave us a free upgrade when we checked in. The rooms are clean and the staff are more then friendly. We were very impressed with our stay.I read that the breakfast was expensive and to go to starbucks but I would recommend having the breakfast there as starbucks doesn't open until 9am and plus the hotel offers a buffet breakfast so you can fuel up for the day.Its easier to eat out in the evening for less as the chinese in general don't really cater for breakfast very well.The hotel has a very good gym, swimming pool, bar with a 360' view, rotating restaurant, buffet restaurant, meeting rooms, free internet computer use as well as having a free internet use in each room. I think it offers very good value for money. You can access the new world shopping mall from the hotel. Bottom floor there is a good pharmacy.5th floor there is an ice rink. You can easily walk to the bund from the hotel and see the wonderful sight of Pudong lit up at night. On route in the evening there is constant squawking from traders to buy things( don't think Alan Sugar would be impressed with there pitches! it does get a little annoying). M on the bund is a nice restaurant to eat in and a treat. If you wanted to get across to the Pudong side then the site seeing tunnel is a interesting way of doing so.Its open until 10.30pm.The taxis in shanghai are a different experience! We didn't have an accident but came close many times. It is very cheap to get around though. If you are going somewhere far out make sure you get the concierge to translate into Chinese and write down where you are going incase the taxi driver gets lost, like ours did!I will be definitely staying here again as I couldn't fault the hotel or the staff.I managed to book a good rate through expedia. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good Hotel ..very good service I recently stayed one night in this hotel. I was put into an executive floor room; check in straight through and up to the 35th floor. This process was smooth, fast very polite and efficient. (I liked happy hour in the bar on the same floor).My room was on the 33rd Floor. I can say a well designed space; I had no problems with any part of it accept the following minor observation. The dark timber used in the room furnishing is showing wear and can show up stains very clearly, housekeeping could be better in this regard. Similarly the bed head need s the hair oil and dandruff flakes wiped off from the previous occupant. Elvis may have left the building but his dandruff was still stuck on the bed head! Thank goodness for antiseptic wipes! Room service was without fault as was the laundry service. I had dinner in the revolving restaurant on the 44th floor and had a great night. I will stay here again.Very professionally run facility. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great location Comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Friendly staff and service. Temperature control was limited in the room (it was either too hot or too cold) and breakfast was very expensive for what you get, but we still enjoyed our stay. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,A Pleasant Stay We only had one night in Shanghai but we found this hotel very comfortable and well located - we were offered a free upgrade which no doubt enhanced our stay. Based on our experience and the recommendations of locals and others on TA would definitely stay here again 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,Great location superb swimmingpool! This hotel faces the peoples square in shanghai. Lots of restaurants and bars (Starbucks) nearby! Rooms a very big and modern. It has a huge swimmingpool; great! 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"We loved the Radisson New World My wife and I spent the last 10 nights of February at the Radisson New World . We were booked on the club floor which was just terrific. Upon entering the club room on our first morning the hostess welcomed us and from then on the staff knew our names, what we preferred to eat each morning for breakfast, and what we liked to drink during the cocktail period. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast each morning at the club where we meet some very interesting people from all over the world. We tried the dining room once for breakfast and while the buffet assortment was copious we liked the low key atmosphere of the club. We had a Deluxe room which had a separate small office area and a large bedroom with king size bed. The bathroom was fabulous with a separate toilet area, bath tub, and huge walk in shower. Everything done in a beautiful neutral marble.The location could not be better. Out the door and one can walk the pedestrian mall area on Nanjing Road continuing to the end and there is the Bund. Also walk to all the museums, People's Park, antiquing on Dong Tai Road, and of course the big knock off multi- story mall on Nanjing Road West.A value added plus is the low cost of the taxi rides....never more than $2-4.Since we were gone almost the entire day we enjoyed eating in the hotel in the evening. The first floor restaurant was excellent and you could order ala carte or the buffet which offered everything from seafood to lamb chops cooked to order with a large selection of accompaniments. The entire staff was very kind and helpful at all times. The housekeeping was excellent. We truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and look forward to returning again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,A good choice Very well placed Hotel for the tourist on foot. We upgraded our room for 250Y a night which gave us a great bathroom and an office area. My roomwas a little hot and the hotel never really understood the problem so I kepth the window open. Not so good in smog filled Shanghai. Otherwise the staff were attentive and helpful. A good concierge desk although there is little choice and tours tend to concentrate on &quot;opportunities&quot; for you to spend money. Good food options and a fun bar on floor 45. 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent hotel This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The hotel location is excellent. It is at the end of Nanjing Rd (great for shopping) a short 15-20 min walk to the Bund and also the Metro station. If you are getting a taxi, get the hotel staff can write out where you would like to go in Chinese so you know what stop to get off on the subway. The service at the hotel is outstanding. The staff is really helpful and friendly. Most of the staff at the hotel can speak English which makes it easy as a tourist. The room/bathroom are beautiful, with fantastic views of the city.Go up to the restaurant on the top floor also, and get panoramic views. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Hotel! The Radisson was a great hotel, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel to Shanghai. It is very well located, right in the heart of busy Nanjing Rd. There is a huge department store right next door, which includes a large pharmacy (very useful if you're going in the winter time and suddenly get a cold). Nanjing pedestrian mall is just down the street, right next to the Royal Meridien Hotel, which has some good restaurants. The rooms in the Radisson (try get one above the 21st floor) are pretty spacious, with a large desk, desk chair, full-length mirror, coffee table and two comfy chairs. The bathroom was also large and well designed. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful, writing out destinations in Chinese for us. And if you happen to stumble across bad weather, you can simply borrow an umbrella from the concierge and return it at the end of the day. Windows on the Park, the restaurant just above the lobby, is large and spacious and the buffet breakfasts there are excellent. There is a lot of variety, Western and Asian, from pastries and fruit, to pancakes, hash browns, spring rolls and fried rice. But don't buy a bottle of water from the hotel deli - they charge too much. You can buy one from a department store for much cheaper. All in all, a great experience! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Highly recommended on all counts We can highly recommend this hotel. It is in an excellent location at the top of the East Nanjing Road mall. Over the road from the park and easy walk to the major galleries and museums. Over the road from the metro. Surrounded by shops and 10 minutes walk to the markets.The hotel has a great pool and gym area. But the very best thing is the wonderful concierge service. we approached them many times each day to help with translating destinations, booking tickets, restaurants and transport (train tickets). Even writing out things in Chinese. The concierge service really makes the city accesible for those of us who don't speak Mandarin. The rooms were very comfortable and nice bathrooms (especially in suite upgrade). Free internet connection in your room is a bonus for checking weather and Trip Advisor! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Fantastic service great location Stayed in the Radisson New World from 27 Dec 07 to 7 Jan 08. Hotel was in a great location - right on People's Square. I had stayed in the Hengshang Mollerville in the French Concession District before but found this far more convenient. as a base from which to explore the city. Right out on the square so you could just hail a cab whenever. UFO style restaurant on the top floor was a handy landmark - made finding your way back easy if you went wandering off the square for a few hours without a map. Fantastic service - really efficient and friendly concierge teamwith fluent English. Important if you don't speak the language as it can be tricky navigating the city without some local help translating addresses for cabs. I was travelling with family and booked a double and a twin. I asked for two quiet rooms in the City Tower and got them - the rooms are arranged in a ring around the lifts so if you get them in the middle i.e. at the furthest point from the lifts - then there is very little footfall passing your door. We took rooms 7 and 8 on 27th floor - assume layout is the same on each floor. Rooms were nothing to write home about but comfortable and a decent size. Ditto the bathrooms - everything you need and some decent cosmetic products to boot. Tea and coffee making facilities in each room and fresh milk in the fridge each day - an unexpected dairy treat in China! Free internet connection in the rooms which was just as well as hotel rate in the business centre was 4 Euro for 15 Mins!!! Definitely worth bringing a laptop if you plan on using the web. We did not book a room including breakfast but had it twice a la carte and it was good. Tons of it so order conservatively and share and you won't be broke. In general the hotel the food was fairly good value for the standard of the hotel but drinks were pretty outrageous - inadvertantly paid 5 Euro for a peppermint tea one morning. One very useful resource was the hotel Deli which sold take out sandwiches and salads and pastries quite reasonably - 2.20 - 3.50 Euro for a nice sandwich. Handy if you wanted some Western grub on the run. Decent quality although limited range of stuff. Most of the front of house staff spoke excellent English with the peculiar exception of the room service staff who were unable to take even the most straightforward order from the menu. The facilities in the hotel were good and it was all jazzed up for Christmas which was nice if a bit tack-tastic. Personally, I thought the lobby looked a lot better when they took all the glitz down on 6 Jan -really quite an impressive entrance. The hotel has a decent size pool but it was not very well heated and a bit cold for my liking. One bizzare fearture of the hotel was that there was a jacuzzi and cold plunge pool for male guests but none for female. No idea what the story is there... The steam room and sauna were fine - one each for men and one each for the ladies. Gym looked great and I think there may be squash courts too... I used the hotel spa towards the end of my stay and wished I had used it earlier. Was good and well priced - 18 Euro for a 30 min facial which seemed like a bargain to me. I only ate in the revolving restaurant &quot;Epicure on 45&quot; once - just so much choice in Shanghai it seemed like a cop out to eat in the hotel. We went on our last night. The food was good but we did feel very rushed by the staff and the service was not great. In fairness to them we were eating late and they did mention their closing time when we booked. Still, we only ordered one course and still really felt under pressure to eat and leave. Fab views though - better than from Cloud 9 in my opinion - so book early and plan to stay a while. They had some cheap options if you are on a budget - curry and pasta dishes were around 10-15 Euro. (A good tip for posh restaurants in Shanghai - ask for iced water. It is perfectly safe in high end places. Other options such as Evian clock in at aroung 8 Euro a bottle and you could easily find your beverages costing more than the food.) The location of the Radisson was great - People's Square is a good starting point and we were in walking distance from the Bund which was nice as the weather was sunny and cold - good for a promenade stroll. Also you could check out the old folks practising Tai Chi in the People's Park and on East Nanjing Road in the mornings if you were up early enough ( 7:00-7:30). The New World Mall beside the hotel (which you can enter from the hotel) has a drugstore in the basement called Watsons.It sold all the necessaries and had some recognisable brands of shampoo etc. If you have kids with you there is an ice rink in the mall too - on the 5/6th floor I think. Overall a very pleasant stay. The hotel website suggest s that there is no airport pickup but they arranged a transfer to Pudong for us in a large people carrier when we left . Cost 280 RMB. Might be worth seeing if they can pick you up at Pudong as it was a much less nerve racking experience than the inbound cab journey and had the added luxury of functioning seatbelts in the back seat which is a rarity in Shanghai. (We were involved in no less than 3 collisions in our 11 day stay - two were minor and involved clipping cyclists - one more serious and quite scary but luckily nobody was hurt) I would definitely stay again - worth noting that we were visiting during the quietest time of year which meant that the hotel was quite quiet and People's Square/Nanjing Road was fairly civilised too. I reckon if you visit at a peak tourist time such as Chinese New Year it could be a more hectic experience both in the hotel and the immediate environs. That aside I would highly recommend the New World - for the location and the service. For a reasonably posh hotel it was very relaxed - not at all stuffy and the staff were really friendly and obliging. I know some of the local run hotels are a bit cheaper but my experience staying in one the last time was that the standard of English made communication a tiring and frustrating experience for all concerned. The poor receptionist at Hengshang Mollerville looked like she wanted to cry whenever we approached to look for an address or book a show. It wasn't that the staff were unfriendly or unwilling to help - the language barrier was just exhausting for everyone. Make life easy for yourself and book somewhere the staff can help you make the most of your time in the city. You will have plenty of interaction with non English speakers all day and it was nice to come &quot;home&quot; and take a break from Shanghai charades. (My brother's mined request re:toilet facilities in Plaza 66 was the highlight of this particular game- stony faced security guard actually cracked up. I was just glad we weren't arrested for public indecency) Staying in the New World really made a huge difference to my enjoyment of the city this time around. Just book it! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,FANTASTIC! Just retruned from my New Year's trip in Shanghai. The hotel location is excellent. It is at the end of Nanjing Rd (great for shopping) a short 15-20 min walk to the Bund and right across the street from People's Square where you can walk to the museums and also the Metro station. The hotel staff can write out where you would like to go in Chinese so you know what stop to get off on the subway. Also taxi drivers do not speak English so have where you want to go written down in Chinese. The service at the hotel is outstanding. The staff is really helpful and friendly. Most of the staff at the hotel can speak English which makes it easy as a tourist. The room/bathroom are beautiful. My room was located on the 33rd floor with a great view of the TV tower. I reserved a deluxe club room which included breakfast in the rate and also fresh fruits in the room daily. All around just a FANTASITC hotel and FANTASTIC city. Enjoy your visit. 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Shanghai Weekend My family recently spent three days staying in the Radisson New World Hotel in Shanghai . What can we say ? Overall a good trip and a worhtwhile place to visit however Shanghai is very busy and noisy . Very much a city of the haves and have nots where high rise glitzy buildings neighbour slums . However the hotel was a good place to chill after the hussle and bustle of the city . Excellent location right beside Renmin Park/Square Underground station and in the middle of Nanjing Lu where Nanjing Xie meets Nanjing Dong Lu . Easy walking distance of most of Shanghai sites , the Bund , HuaiHai Lu , YuYan Gardens and of course easy underground access to PuDong area . Great hotel with excellent facilities and accomodation .Fantastic view from roof top revolving restaurant worthwile checking out the Sky bar also ! Prices for food and drink bit on expensive side compared with other Chinese cities but hey you are in Shanghai . Breakfasts were superb !We also spent some time shopping in Super Brand Mall in PuDong , prices dearer than UK . We ate in the Bund View restaurant , good views of river and Blue Frog bar , good food and music . We went up the Jin Mao tower which gives different perspective of the city !Downsides :Were the hawkers on Nanjing Dong Lu , a firm Bo ya required . The Bund was very disappointing , great views across the river to PuDong but on PuXie side it looks a bit run down and seedy in some places . "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"This is a great hotel Make sure the breakfast buffet is included in your room price when you book because it's a great buffet, you'll love it, and you don't necessarily want to pay for it separately because it's about $25 per person. When you're trying to recover from jet lag it's a great help to start the day with a fabulous buffet especially when you're traveling with three hungry boys as we were. As others have mentioned the health club and pool are wonderful. The treadmills and elliptical machines have built-in TV's. The men's changing room has a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.The junior suite was gorgeous with plenty of room for the kids to set up their board games and me to set up the computer and use the wireless internet. The concierge booked us the Chinese acrobats (don't miss them for anything) at a reasonable price. We booked a professional tour to Suzhou but we had to detour to a water-town (ZhouXiang) because fog closed the road to Suzhou. We got a very attractive English speaking guide so did not have any of the problems in this area that another guest reported.The metro is right across the street. You can walk to the Shanghai Museum in 10 minutes and to the Bund in about one-half hour. In fact we walked all the way to Yu's Gardens but took a cab back. The hotel is on one of the main shopping streets (Nanjing Lu) and is centrally located. Pudong, the French Concession and Xintiandi are just short metro rides away. Everyone at this hotel was nice. We stayed here 5 days and really loved this hotel. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"as good as home Switched from the sheraton and went to the new world because of its great position in the centre of shanghai, this was my second stay at this hotel in 8 weeks and it is starting to feel like home. Great staff attentive and helpful might be the australian gms influence the restaurants are all of a high quality and the revolving retaurant is spectacular. You can walk to everthing and the near by shopping is world class. It is a hotel that i will just keep coming back to because it makes you feel like your home "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"nice place (my 2nd visit) wE BOOKed it through its wb site. This is the 2nd time we satyed there sicne 2 years ago. Great location and nice rooms. The only complain we had this time is the AC is not working in the room, after they moved us to another room, we had no problem. Room is big and clean, with two TV. You can exchange money up to 400 bucks a day. The nearby banks are with long lines so I got my RMB from the hotel. The breakfast and lunch are OK, and expensive. You can go to the next door(mall) with many places to get food. There is 7-11 ish place behind hotel so you can get some drinks over there. The biggest problem we had this time is the begger in front door at night. The hotel seems has aggreement with them. They don't show up during the day. But at night, they come out and right in your face. I am not saying this is the problem in this hotel. It seems the problem in general in China these days. Otherwise, we like ths hotel. We stayed there when it first opened a couple years ago. Now, it is a bit expensive, but the hotel is still good. We will not mind coming back.PS becasue its location, it is hard to get a cab during 6-8 pm dinner time, but the hotel staffs are pretty good at helping you out to get one. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent hotel and staff Excellent hotel in great location, we stayed on the business floor and the staff in the lounge were very helpful. I was with my wife and it is good location very close to the shopping in Nan Jing and the Bund.The revolving restaurant on the 45 floor may be a little on the expensive side but the views and food are good.The rooms on the business floors are in 2 parts 1 with a desk TV and pay bar the other with the bed and 3 part bathroom. It really suited what we wanted from our stay. I was entirely happy with the hotel.A visit to the Pearl TV tower, a short taxi ride away, and its revolving restaurant at 265 mts (1,000) feet are worth while, a package for everthing including a short river cruise is about £30 ($60) "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Had a great time here. After a 5 day organized tour, my wife and I set out for 3 days alone in Shanghai. This location is terrific and very close to excellent shopping---the New World, 8 story mall is attached to the hotel.For other than pedestrian outings, the cabs are a wonderful bargain but the square, NanJing shopping street and the Bund are withing walking distance.The hotel lobby is very attractive and desk persons understood 2 non Chinese speaking Americans. (Check-in, concierge &amp; money changing experiences were great) We booked a room that gave us access to the Club Lounge and the staff there was superior as well as very attentive.Revolving restaurant has a great lunch special with one fantastic view of this amazing city---no hurry from staff so we stayed for over 90 minutes and could have lingered longer.We'd stay here again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good quality great location My wife and I stayed in this hotel in September 2007 for 4 nights.The Radisson New World is a top quality hotel in Shanghai with an excellent location for tourists. It is situated on famous Nanjing Rd, across from a subway station, and walking distance to the Shanghai Museum. We walked to the Bund at night, it took about 45 minutes at a leisurely pace.During the day you can cut through to the adjacent shopping mall then walk underground to the subway station across the road. Be aware that the subway is very crowded, so watch your belongings. Also be prepared to barge your way in and out or risk getting left behind.After staying in 4 other hotels on a tour, the best feature of the Radisson New World was SOFT BEDS! Our room was good, a typical standard room for a 4-5 star hotel. The shower and bedroom are seperated by a glass screen - a nice touch. You can watch tv while in the shower!While it is great to be on Nanjing Rd, we actually did most of shopping (especially clothes) on Huai Hai Rd. We caught the subway there.The hotel service is professional but some of the staff seemed snobby and disinterested.The pool area is impressive and the pool itself is large and great for either a relaxing dip or swimming laps. The gym is well equipped.One block away behind the hotel are some authentic Shanghai backstreets, a markedly different atmosphere from Nanjing Rd. If you go down the street with Taco Bell on the corner then take your first left, you will find a cheap supermarket, fruit stores, and more. Just be careful to dodge the scooters and traffic.Overall the Radisson is worthy of its 5-star rating but nothing spectacular. It perhaps lacks a bit of character but is convenient and good value for its location and quality. 4.5 out of 5. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Hotel One of the Best! I have stayed at this hotel once in 2006 and again recently and the staff continue to WOW me! My family had their most enjoyable stay in a great location. The hotel is impecable in cleanliness, the spa/pool/fitness center is one of the best for family leisure. Everything in Shanghai is just a hop step and a jump away. The Concierge staff were one of the best that I have come across in my travels around the world, they cared about my family and gave us all the right advice to places to visit at a low cost. I read previously a negative about the Conciereg staff at the hotel, this person must have had a bad day...Going to Shanghai? one of the best hotels to stay in! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Expensive not luxury Looking forward to staying here at the end of our holiday. Thought we would get a large, modern room for the money. They did upgrade us apparently, but we still felt the room was pretty ordinary. It had another smaller room attached with a TV and desk and wardrobe - but we would have preferred to not have them separated. The bathroom was very nice though, with a huge shower and toilet area. The view from our room wasn't the most interesting, although we were 27 floors up. Would have preferred to see the park or Nanjing Road. I suppose we were looking forward too much to this place, and it let us down. It was a typical expensive hotel, particularly the bar. They didn't have any cheaper wines on the wine list, just the ones that cost £30! and not much atmosphere there, with just a few tourists sat around listening to the band singing. Breakfast wasn't included in the price, and was expensive if you ordered it. Room service for two burgers and a plate of fruit cost us £20. Reception was good and efficient, and they quickly found us a taxi for the airport. Not a bad hotel, just not very interesting or worth the money. They did bring us two chocolates each evening too, ringing on the doorbell and then bursting into the room within seconds!!! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Service Stinks First, let me say that the hotel rooms and facilities are nice. It is also located in a good location. However, if you are a westerner who is unfamiliar with Shanghai you will need help from the concierge desk to get around town and do things. This is where this hotel is awful. My wife and I had a number of issues with the concierge, but on our last day there it hit rock bottom. We asked for their assistance in doing a day trip to Suzhou. They initially told us to take a train, but forgot to mention that we should make resevations in advance. So when we went to the station to buy tickets the trains were sold out. We then asked them to get us a car to take us. To our surprise the concierge hails a taxi and tells the guy to take us to Suzhou. The guy obviously had no idea where we were going so we spent the next six hours driving around rural China until I forced the taxi driver to get off the road and turnaround. When I got back to the hotel, the concierge joked that he must have gotten us a stupid cab driver and offered to make it up by getting someone to drive us to the airport the next day. Not what I would expect to make up for ruining our last day in China. I strongly recommend spending a little extra money on a five star hotel because the service aspect is really important in China. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Hotel Wonderful hotel. Great location, friendly staff and excellent restaurants. Actually the main coffee shop in the hotel served absolutely great food at a reasonable price. Stayed there twice in October, 2007 and both times was upgraded to a junior suite for no additional cost and without asking for it. The place is a must stay when in Shanghai. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"new world is actually old world We booked a 2 bedroom suite ( family suite ) as the price seemed like a bargain relativelly speaking.I will not slam the hotel as our experience was not in keeping with this forum's comments where-in the reviews for the hotel are generally good.My advice is DO NOT book the 2 bedroom suite, it is next to a glass elevator and reminds one of sleeping in a hotel on top of the tube in london. click clak constantlly.Otherwise the hotel, staff etc measured up to comments in this hotels review pages.The hotel is very well located although busy and noisy.We booked out next morning and moved to grand hyatt jin maoIf you can get the rooms for the same price, dont think twice, Hyatt blows away everything in Shanghai.My review on the Hyatt will be forthcoming "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"The best hotel I've ever stayed in! This is one amazing hotel... The lobby alone is worth a visit. It all started with me being upgraded to the lounge floors - Exceptional view! Only book this hotel if you have 3-4 hours for their spa/pool area, because that really rocks! Also remember to visit the sky bar at night! WOW... "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Best Hotel in Asia Everything about this hotel is great.Staff are friendly &amp; helpful and speak english!!! The rooms are fab, very clean, good size and modern as well as some terrific views over Shanghai's sky line. The location is second to none and everything is in walking distance. Good value for money. Don't think twice... JUST BOOK IT! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"perfect spot first time in china, and first nights in shanghai! this hotel was well situated for us. People's square is a good spot to start exploring the city (museums, nanjing street, old city, xintiandi, french concession...). the reeption was friendly and helpful. we told them it was our first time there, and we got a splendid view on people's square from the 36th floor. the breakfast room was nice, and the choice plenty. nothing to complain about. I'd come again, even if I think the marriott might be another good option (htey have a great champagne bar).the only thing i thought was not up to it was the restaurant at the top of the hotel. it looked boring and empty...didn't eat there though. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"thumbs up!! i'm writing right now from the cute little desk in our two-room suite at the hotel, which is not huge, but quite comfortable, and has free internet access. the hotel is in an awesome spot, and the city is amazing. usually i prefer smaller, historic hotels, but shanghai is all about new and gliz, and since my husband is here for an &quot;international residency&quot; through school, my daughter and i have joined him. the pool is fabulous! and the sky bar on the 47th floor and the bizarre filipino band doing covers of michael jackson songs (but only singing the back-up vocals while a taped singer does the main part) - well, it's fantastically out-of-body. viva! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Brilliant location good hotel I booked this hotel due to the location. It's right in the middle of everything. On the main part of Nanjiang rd (the main shopping street). right above a metro stop. and because of the good trip advisor reviews.We had 3 rooms and booked a discounted rate through the website. On check in we were offered an upgrade to a deluxe for about US$30 which we were told would be a larger room with an office area and a walk in shower (opposed to the above the bathtub ones). This turned out to be a good move as the rooms were significantly larger (i caught a glimpse of a standard room from the hall) Plus the office area, though a little strange in layout was a good addition. Our rate didn't include breakfast and I didn't pay the 200rmb(abt US$30) for the buffet as i thought it was too much.We did try an a la carte breakfast there one day but I think we must have been the first to do so for ages as they took about 40 minutes to cook some eggs. If your rate doesn't include breakfast then I'd suggest across the road there is a little stand that sells pastries and really excellent portuguese tarts (yes I know it sounds strange being china but they are a Macau recipe)The design of the hotel is very chinese with a lot of gold and glitz. it's a little over the top for my liking but nice nevertheless. The location is fantastic with everything on your doorstep. The staff are very friendly and willing to help and basically this is an excellent choice for a stay in Shanghai. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A Superb Property We have just returned from our first visit to Shanghai, having stayed 3 days at the Radisson New World, June 2007. We experienced attentative service with all frontline staff with exceptional attention given to us by bell boys. Excellent advice and direction, tips and recommendation was provided on local sights, services and in particular, shopping areas. Although many staff communicated in basic English, assistance was sought from peers when terminology required clarification.Our Delux room was very accomodating, having upgraded at check in at the recommendation of Reception staff. This was expected, and according to our booking agent, room configurations were not confirmed until one actually checked in. We arrived at the hotel at 9.15 am our room was immediately available rather than wait until the usual 2 pm check in time. Our room was serviced daily to a high standard, followed up by an and early evening service with complimentary chocolates and towel replacement if required. We had a great view of the city and The Peoples Park.Hotel amenities were well appointed; large pool, fitness rooms, lobby area, bar etc. We dined inhouse for breakfast and supper with a good range of food tastes on offer; Buffet and A la Carte.As has previously been stated in other reviews, this property is well situated on Nanjing Road (E) &amp; (W). Shops and department stores in the adjacent hotel area were very handy, although, almost all retail staff we encountered spoke no English.Our only suggestion being more brochures, advertising or postcards of local attractions, shows or events could have been displayed in the hotel lobby area as we would have liked to have attended an evening show if possible.Prompt personalised email correspondence was received from the Hotel Manager regarding our completed check-out feedback forms, proving an open direct line to management within days of our departure which was appreciated.We would definitely like to return to this property again in the near future. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Simply Follows Shanghai's Heartbeat We stayed at the Radisson New World Shanghai for three nights in August 2006. We have designated to a deluxe king size bedroom included buffet breakfast.The staffs at the front desk on arrival and departure were efficient with fairly good english. Concierge were very enthusiastic to say the least although they have a little bit frustated with their limited english knowledge. A taxi to the airport was stand-by every time you need in front of the hotel.The room was spacious, nice and clean. We had a small office space after the doorstep with an LCD TV and a desk. The bedroom nicely arranged, nice ambience and clean. The bed was comfortable though a little hard with another LCD TV which have english movie channels and news channels. The bathroom was really nice, bath tub in whirpool design and separated rain-drop shower room. The lighting was remarkable combined with sun-shade blindfolded and glasses separation to the bedroom.All room functions were located at the table beside the bed, such as room lighting, TV switch, air-con switch, make-up room and don't disturb mark. We had our breakfast at the 'Windows on the Park' Restaurant at the hotel. The buffet was sumptous with asian, chinese and western variety of foods. Continental style breakfast was also available for choices of fresh juices, yoghurt, cereal, fresh fruit, cheeses, congee, etc. Don't bother to skip your breakfast since the New World shopping and food mall is located next door and it had connecting access to the hotel's lobby. Many type of restaurants spreaded in each floor were available at your choice, i.e. from starbuck, mcdonald, ajisen ramen, hotpot, chinese, steak and fusion. There is also a souvenier shop on the lobby level for last minute souveniers - but beware of the price which you may preferable to find other stores in the mall next door. Nevertheless, the location is premier. It takes 5 minutes walk to Nanjing Rd., the famous shopping district in Shanghai towards the Bund area (french concession). Subway station is adjacent to the hotel building and sharply above the New World shopping and food mall. You can directly use 'maglev' service and continue by subway to reach the hotel from the airport. Its only cost you RMB68 (for maglev, one way) and RMB5 (for subway). The taxi service from hotel to the airport costs about RMB120. We will definitely stay again at Radisson New World Shanghai and also recommend anyone. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Not what I expected I had booked a room in the Hotel's Radisson Club Suite and was disappointed by the service I received. The executive club was practically empty and the service very official. Despite paying for a club facility, I was told that breakfast would not be served on the 20th floor (Club) but at the ground floor restaurant because of the public holidays in China. Evening drinks/canapes were also not being served at the club . The staff at the restaurant were unfriendly - when I complained that my tea was served cold, the waitress sniggered and went on to talk about me to her colleagues. The room was good - I can't complain about it, although it was rather substandard compared to other five star hotels I have stayed in. A series of other complaints led me to have a meeting with the manager. I was offered a refund for the inconvenience. The only thing I could really marvel at was the location of the hotel. I am sure others have probably had very good stays there - but unfortunately I didn't. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Another great stay! This is my third stay here and for good reason! It has a great location, beautiful hotel and was actually one of the less expensive five star hotels in Shanghai. I booked it last year because it was rated highly here on TripAdvisor and less than a year later I've come back because it was such a great find last time. I stayed for leisure while my fiancee was there for work. The location is within safe walking distance from everything for lone travelers. Will return again! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great location We stayed here for 3 nights at a good rate quoted on the internet and then confirmed by our travel agent as we wanted to make sure they put an extra bed in the room [CNY 1,063 per night plus 300 for a rollaway]. The location is excellent at the top of East Nanjing Rd and across from People's Square. The staff were fine, the room big enough for the 3 of us with a good bathroom. The only quibble I had with the room was that it was hard to adjust the air conditioning and the room was always too warm for me.The hotel buffet breakfast was good but expensive compared with prices outside the hotel, but this is the same for all the hotels we stayed at in China. There is an excellent street for restaurants just behind the hotel and we ate at different places each night. There is an excellent indoor swimming pool, a pool table which appeals to teenagers [ you have to pay] and mah jong tables. I would stay here again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"High Above Shanghai An excellent hotel and worthy of a 5 star rating. We booked on the Hotel website and they offered an AAA rate and we chose the Club level with breakfast. Upon arrival we were upgraded from a queen room to a suite with king bed and although the hotel information said continental breakfast, we were offered a full American breakfast on the club level or the choice of eating in the cafe. The location is great at the head of the Nanjing walking area and close to other points of interest like the museum. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Not Bad We stayed at the Radisson for approximately week in March 2007. The staff at the front desk on arrival were polite enough although not overly friendly, with fairly good english, and they upgraded us to the club floor free of charge. Bell boys were very enthusiastic to say the least. The room itself was quite nice and clean, although it had an odd smell at first which we must have gotten used to because I didn't notice it by the next day. We also had a small office with a TV and a desk, although not all that comfortable! The bedroom was small but also nice and clean, and the bed was comfortable (if a little hard but still decent). Another TV in the bedroom as well with some english movie channels and news channels. The bathroom was really nice, although the lights were constantly flickering so we eventually just stopped turning them on.We also had problems with people constantly wanting to come in our room for something - first housekeeping (fair enough), then restocking the minibar, then again somebody wanting to come in to change something on the phone, and then again 2 more people but not explaning why, we asked them to come back in half an hour and they never did. Very strange and a little annoying, we asked the duty manager about it and he apologised for so many interruptions but told us to put the do not disturb sign on - fair enough, but we couldn't find one. Eventually we figured out it was actually a button next to the bed, although there was nothing to indicate that's what it was.We ate a few times at their restaurant 'Windows on the park' at the buffet, which was decent but a pricey for Shanghai. I suggest going mainly for the Asian food. Didn't try any of the other restaurants as they were even more expensive, although we did have a couple of drinks at the bar downstairs near the lobby.The little souvenier shop on the lobby level was useful to get some last minute souveniers (although not cheap, look elsewhere if you can) - the shop selling little Jade pieces and statues had some beauitful things but very, very expensive, and a crazy sales man. Concierge was always very helpful. Only problem we had here was when we were leaving, they got a taxi for us (we had previously just flagged them down ourselves), and i think it was an illegal taxi because his meter was going double time - not sure if this was their fault or not, but I had been warned that that sometimes happened before I went, so my own fault I guess!P.S If you are considering using the virtual golf (8th floor i think), don't bother! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A bit disappointing As with everything in Shanghai, the minute you arrive at the Radisson New World, you're being sold MORE MORE MORE than what you ordered. We had booked a Deluxe suite, and immediately the woman behind the counter began trying to sell us an upgrade. For an extra $85 a night we would have the use of the Club Floor, which basically meant free breakfast and all-day cookies. When we decided not to upgrade, she looked a little crestfallen and announced &quot;NO BREAKFAST&quot;. OK, we knew that.Our room was ....odd. We had booked a &quot;Deluxe Suite with Sitting Area&quot;. The Sitting Area turned out to be a sort of office, with a little desk and a chair on each side. All we could do was play &quot;job interview&quot;. It wasn' t a comfortable place to sit and watch TV.Our second day there, we went out and then returned to our room at around midday, for a nap. While we were napping, someone came into the room. It was a young lady who peered in at us, lying in bed, and said &quot;Just checking the mini bar&quot;! Oh really??? Not ten minutes later, the doorbell rang and someone wanted to change some light bulbs. Ten minutes after THAT, the doorbell rang again - did we have laundry? I mean, what the hell? Maybe we were just really strange looking and the staff was all coming up to have a look?I had a foot massage (excellent) and a facial (so-so) in the spa on the 7th floor. Both times the technician tried to sell me more than I had booked...you want a full massage? you want a full facial? But I was learning that this is the way things are in Shanghai -- everyone is trying to sell you. It's a good place to learn how to say no, and you should. The location of the Radisson is perfect, right in the center of town, across from the subway, a short walk to the Bund along the amazing shopping street. The Starbucks next door doesn't open til 9:30 am though, so if you need a latte, you'll have to walk a few blocks. The room was a bit dark, especially the bathroom, which only had indirect lighting (sometimes that's a merciful thing, but sometimes you want to see what you really look like). Our view was pretty bad, we looked down on the cover over the pool, and a construction site. Personally I think we paid a little too much for this room (we paid around $200 a night). It has its good points but its far far from a five star hotel. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Fantatsic Hotel Radisson Hotel Shanghai New World is excentlly located near the Nanjing Pedastrian Walkway. Bell hops and staff at the concierge were wonderful, especially two of the staff, Michael and Wilson. They were courteous and helpful. However, some of the receptionists were not as nice and sincere. The hotel room was nice and clean. Beds were comfortable although the pillows were a tad too soft. On the whole, the stay was good. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Very Good Hotel Option - Excellent Location I did a search on expedia and hotels.com and found the exact same rate on the Radisson website for 988 RBM per night. Reasonable for a 4-star hotel. The front desk and concierge were very helpful and polite which I found an uncommon trait in the big city of Shanghai. I had a standard room, but found it very comfortable - both the bed and bathroom. The bathroom was interesting in that there were blinds which could enable a person to see out (or in) from the bedroom. One small problem was that the bathroom drain was clogged, but otherwise no complaints. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Very central and right on Nanjing Road. Walking distance to shopping shopping and more shopping. Less than ten minutes walk to Shanghai Museum and the subway is right across the street.Very happy with this hotel option. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent Location The staff were very welcoming ang pleasent. and the concierge were very helpful. The hotel was in a very convenient location close to the People's Square Metro station and close to the shops. The decoration was modern and the rooms were clean.On the overall an average hotel for Asian standards, would stay there again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Fantastic place to stay I have to agree with the previous reviewer! The hotel was great, with the staff not being able to do enough for you. I also upgraded to a club room, which was well worth the 580 RMB per night - included breakfast, happy hour and use of a meeting room for a couple of hours.The Radisson Shanghai New World is centrally located, within walking distance of the Bund. I only ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night, which was ok. However, the staff are happy to recommend restaurants to go to, and helpfully will write the address of the location on a card for the taxis drivers.Other reviewers have recommended using the Metro - I used taxis all week, as they are so cheap. However, the Maglev train is a must - amazing to think you are going over 400km/h!Would I stay at this hotel again - definately, and I recommend that you do as well. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Shanghai - A whole new world! We booked the Radisson New World hotel on the strength of the Radisson brand. As we were travelling with our 10 month old son we wanted the security of a good hotel for our stay in Shanghai and the Radisson New World was just that!We arrived via taxi from the airport (which seemed to take ages) and having checked in the bell boy took our luggage to our room. The room was nice but noisy as from early in the morning there was construction work being carried out on a site next door. We spoke to the duty manager who was happy to move us and arranged for the new room to be made up and our belongings moved.The hotel was nice and modern and once you have gotten used to the Chinese way we were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay. The pool and gym were good and we also used the virtual golf room which was about £6 for an hour (it is 10 times that in London). I was dissapointed that there was a spa in the mens but not the ladies changing room but life goes on!I had a pedicure at the beauty spa and although the spa looks amazing I was dissapointed with the pedicure ... poor choice of colours which were cheap brands and not what I would call a pedicure - I could have done better myself. I was probably just unlucky with my therapist ....On one night we ate room service and the food was great, we also ate in the chinese restaurant in the hotel where the food was very good and the rotating restaurant where the choice was fantastic and you got to see the city as you ate. We did have a few hiccups with the service (brought the wrong meal and the wrong desert to my other half) but they were very apologetic and tried to make up for it so it was no big deal.Breakfast in the windows restaurant was an odd affair ... as breakfast was not included we only ate there once during our stay but the service was slow and there was a language barrier. It was very expensive for what it was so if breakfast is not included in your stay I'd look elsewhere. We mainly bought fruit and paistries from the Bread shop which were fantastic and cost next to nothing.If you are in China with a baby be prepeared for lots of attention - we were followed around and watched for our entire stay which did get a bit tiring toward the end.All in all, Shanghai was an amazing experince and the Radisson was a big part of that for us, the hotel is in a great location, the concierge were fantastic and really made our stay enjoyable and stress free. I'd definately stay there again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A lesson in excellence Having thoroughly researched the hotels of Shanghai I reserved a room in the Radisson New World for the following reasons.1. Most reviewers recommended staying on the Puxi side of the river.2. The Radisson is located on Peoples Square which is a fantastic base to explore the city by metro which is the quickest and cheapest way to move round the city.3. Fantastic value working at around £100 per night for a club deluxe room which included a fantastic breakfast in the club lounge, complimentary drinks and canapes between 5.30 and 7.30 pm and a separate check in facility on the 35th floor.On arrival ,contrary to some reports, we found all the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic with a separate office and plasma tv, stunnning bathroom with a huge walk in shower and corner tub. The room had a corner location on the 32nd floor which gave us stunning views from the bedroom across Peoples square and from the office across to Pudong and the Orient Pearl TV Tower.Breakfast was excellent with a range of western and asian food. Served in the club lounge we frequently found that we had the lounge to ourselves which meant we were out numbered by the staff which resulted in a fantastic service.We used the pool and again found that we had it to ourselves. The male changing rooms also had a separate spa bath and steam room as well as sauna.Bizarrely and to my wife`s annoyance the female changing rooms didn`t have a spa. The bedoom was very well equipped and as well as having beautiful views it also featured a large comfortable bed. There was a turn down service with a beautiful chocolate on our bed each night along with a delightful flower in the roomWe used both the restaurant and the room service which were very good and the food was both tasty and relatively good value.You could also eat in the rotating restaurant although we felt it was a bit too pricey. We also visited the sky dome bar which is located within the UFO that sits aloft the Radisson Tower. A distinctive landmark on the Shanghai skyline , the bar was relatively good value and provided a great view of the city. Overall a fantastic experience and following the recommendation of a TA reviewer I too would suggest upgrading to the Club Rooms.Finally I would suggest arriving from the Airport by the Maglev Train. Travelling in at 300km per hour on the fastest train in the world is an awesome experience. The 30km journey takes just 8 minutes. On arrival you have to change at the adjacent longyang Road metro station to get the metro line 2 into Peoples Square where the Raddison is located. Not straightforward but well worth it in my opinion "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Beware! I appreciate that our experience may not be representative of this hotel - but our stay could have hardly been any worse here. We stayed in a family suite (for 4 people) for 2 nights in this hotel. The smell in the room was beyond description. Adding to that was that there was no way to get any fresh air into the room (windows won't open) and the air / con was constantly heating the room up irrespective of what setting you set it to. Various engineers, etc had a go in fixing it to no avail. To be fair to the hotel, they did offer to move us, but it would have been to different type of rooms and we (naively and mistakenly) assumed that the engineers would be capable of fixing the problem. Clearly, this may have been a one-off, although a similar smell could be felt in other parts of the hotel. On a more positive side, the location is very good for the museum and other sites in Remnin Square and the French Concession and the food (as well as the view) at the revolving restaurant on the 47th floor was very good. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Customer Service - Where are you? This hotel has the best location available and provides a magnificent view. Unfortunately, it lets itself down through a total lack of customer service.We were totally disappointed with the lack of welcome we received after arriving at the hotel. (FYI my husband and I travel globally for work and we spend several hundred nights a year in many different hotels. We remember those that provide excellent customer service and unfortunately we really remember those hotels that lacked customer service). We had travelled 16 hrs and on arrival were told we need to wait 1hr for our double bedroom that we had booked (alternative to take single beds). Then we were advised to come back to reception in 1hr. The reception staff tried to hold a deposit for approximately 4900 Euro for our 12 night stay - and they wanted to charge us a rate that differed from the rate on our booking confirmation. We then had to open our laptops to PROVE the rate at which we had booked. They then advised again that we should come back in 1hr and they specified that they would not come to us to advise us when the room is ready. At the very least I would have expected a welcome drink to compensate for the delay and a message that &quot;please kindly wait in that bar area and we will let you know when the room is ready&quot;. There was zero introduction to the facilities of the hotel - we have never stayed in this particular hotel before and the staff did not tell us anything about their hotel. There was no mention of any details - not even where to find food or the correct lift (there are several different towers). So we had to look up all information ourselves. They could have advised the location of dining areas, breakfast times, gym and spa facilities, which is typical at any hotel we usually stay at. We waited for 1 hour in the bar area next to reception. Nobody approached us to take an order so we sat there cold and tired with no drinks. There were staff walking past us but they did not acknowledge us at all. Terrible. After an hour I started to cough as it was really very cold - so we approached reception who said the room was prepared (they had walked past us and not told us). We tried several elevators and finally had to go and ask someone which one to use - it would have been courteous for the staff to have told us when they gave us the keys. So in general, we have had a very disappointing introduction to the hotel - this is a pity as we were very excited about staying there. We contemplated searching for another hotel where perhaps they would be more welcoming (as we were scheduled to stay for 12 days and nobody wants to pay for a place where will will feel unwelcome for 12 days). After sending a complain email via the free in-room internet (only big plus other than great location), the Duty Manager called our room to say sorry. She upgraded our room to a higher floor and offered us a complimentary drive back to the airport, which was a nice gesture however we are taking the high-speed train back to the airport.We thought that things would then improve and went to dinner on level 3. At first I was impressed by the good service however this suddenly vanished when the staff's shifts ended. They stood around and stared at us (it was 9.50pm) and finally declared that they wanted to close up soon so said that we must pay now and finish up our meals. They continued to stare. We were horrified. After more demonstrations of trying to shove us out, I finally said &quot;Listen - I cannot eat my meal with you all staring at me and asking me to rush&quot;. We had barely been three for 30 minutes at this stage.The next morning at breakfast, I arrive at 10.10am (it finishes at 10.30am). The hostess asked me if I was &quot;sure&quot; I wanted to eat given that they were closing the buffet in 20 minutes. I really have to ask if this hotel wants to have cutsomers or not. If we are really such an inconvenience, perhaps they should shut down and find a job they really like.Although the location was perfect, the terribly unwelcoming customer service has ruined it for me and I will not be staying here again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"How could there be a better hotel in Shanghai?? We just came back from seven nights at this hotel and can't say enough wonderful things about it. Splurge on a Deluxe Room (still only $200) and enjoy the separate office, huge king size BR, and huge bath with separate tub and shower. The location right on People's Square, across from the subway, in the heart of Nanjing Rd. can't be beat. The service was top notch, particularly from the concierge staff - very helpful and enthusiastic. The hotel is lovely - check out the gorgeous indoor pool, work out facility, spa, and revolving restaurant on the 45th floor with the best views of Shanghai. Our room came with b'fast each morning - a huge buffet spread on the 2nd floor. We loved every minute of our stay here and can't wait to go back next year. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Disappoinment Usually TA reviews are spot on but to say this is a No1 hotel in Shanghai is misleading. Stayed 6 nights, fortunately spendingminimal time there as on business. The lobby is an empty expanse with the concierge squashed into a corner, a certain kind of lady hanging around the edges and a busy bar with insufficient seating. My suite had a generous bath and shower but no central light which made the room dingy.The Deluxe rooms had more bedroom area and better lighting. My room stank and needed airing, broken lightbulb and the air con only works at one temp.The top floor bar is a 70s throwback with a heavy (the manager) prowling around.Very good location.The doormen were fantastic at getting cabs on rainy days, the concierge, poor English but very helpful. First floor restaurant a la carte food and room service good. Bit too 'Chinese' for me, if I had the budget would stay at Grand Hyatt otherwise next time will try Sofitel Hyland. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Wonderfully helpful consierge It was our first trip to Shanghai so on our first night I decided to book the Radisson New World Hotel due to the great reviews it received on this site...I have to say I was a little disappointed... Having travelled from London and not slept on the plane we were looking forward to some much needed shut eye at the hotel, however, our room was near a very noisy air conditioning duct (I think) even with our air-con off it still whined away!Having said that I have to say the room was nice and I loved the big window between the bathroom and bedroom. Also, the staff especially the concierge staff were really lovely and helpful. The concierge bought (and paid for) train tickets for the next leg of my journey all arranged via email which saved me from doing it. Other than the great concierge I thought this was quite a standard hotel and definitely not the nicest one we stayed in during our trip to China. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"A superb Shanghai hotel This is a superb hotel, in the best location in Shanghai - at the beginning of Nanjing Road shopping plaza, and opposite the People's Square. It is within walking distance of the Bund, of the Pearl Tower, of the French Concession area, and a short taxi drive from the Yu Yuan Gardens (which are a tourist trap, in my humble opinion!). My son and I stayed here for three nights, and found that our room had a great view, was large, quiet, clean and functional. Despite other reviews, our dining experience here was good - if somewhat expensive for Shanghai. The rooftop bar is fun. We didn't try the pool, but that looked good too. The staff we met were all efficient and very well presented. On the last day, when none of the nearby ATMs would work, a front desk staffer accompanied me down the road to find a working ATM. We would definitely stay here again! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Poor Service for convenient positioned hotel I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip as it was conveniently positioned very close to our Shanghai office. The hotel is a nice looking one as with most Radissons so first impressions are good.The room was comfortable with standard amenities and a bonus was free broadband connection which is quite valuable if on business. The hotel has a great bar on the top floor in the globe which can be seen for miles but as with all of the restaurants in the hotel the service is absolutely appaling. Considering this hotel isn't cheap the staff can really not be bothered to help and when they do try they aren't very good at it. The worse place is the breakfast buffet restaurant, although the selection is good the staff leave tables piled with dirty plates for most of the serving time and also getting a coffee is a nightmare. I think this attitude may be down to the norm in Asia at the moment were you have no choice but to pat 15% service charge which is automatically added...Despite this it is a good location and leisure facilities are good but I would try the Portman Carlton or Grand Hyatt first "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good hotel good stay Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 3 week tour around China. Was very pleased to see quality of room. Clean, modern, spacious, big bed, lovely bathroom and everything else you could want. It was also welcome to see some good food choices on the in-room dining menu at not too exhorbitant prices. View out of window from 27th floor was very impressive with a lot of neon making it look somewhat futuristic (getting like Tokyo). Consider asking for a room which faces the Bund for the best views.We didn't get a chance to go into the revolving restaurant so couldn't comment on the food but had a peek and the views looked tremendous. Bar at the top also has good views but not so sure about the cabaret singers! Overall decor was a bit over the top (gold everywhere) in the main foyer but this wasn't the case in the rooms (which were tasteful) so of no concern.As per previous posts the location is good being placed in on the Nanjing road next to People's (Remin) park and the subway station. Also just a 15-20 minute walk away to the Bund (only other place we'd consider staying). Whilst you can get a taxi to the hotel direct from Airport a better option we thought was to take the Maglev 300 km/h train and then the subway for 5 stops (very, very easy with all relevant signs clearly displayed in English). We were at hotel very quickly and enjoyed the fastest train ride in the world!Only complaints was usual complications of China of lack of English speakers (of course expected in China, just not in an expensive international hotel) at times. Also hotel advertises in their in room service listing that they can arrange a doctor but when we tried to arrange this they called and said actually not possible as 'no-one offers this service'. We complained about this as it was advertised in their own literature and it took some time until we saw some &quot;if you're not happy let us put it right or you won't pay&quot; service (this was the motto, apparently...). Sure this won't affect most people but it's time like when you are ill or another problem event you like to rely on a large, reliable hotel name to help you.Ignoring the niggles we really enjoyed our stay and would probably go again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Very good hotel No complaints about the Radisson New World. Not sure but I think we were upgraded to a bigger room. We reserved the standard room, but if the room we stayed in was standard, then it's an amazing deal. The room has a separate &quot;front&quot; area and the bathroom was really nice.Location of the hotel was excellent. However, I would try another hotel on Nanjing Road West the next time as that area seems more upscale and fun than the Radisson. From the map that area looked remote but I think it's closer to the better restaurants and nightlife.Hotel has excellent services and their pool/spa area is good. The gym is limited to cardio equipment - not much weight stuff. There's a food court in the mall next to the hotel. There's a bakery that has Macao style egg custard that is amazing (for $3RMB!!!). Overall, it's really good value for what you get. If you want to spend more, I would stay at the Four Seasons/Ritz Carlton area or even the Hilton around the Jingan Temple area. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent location - great hotel The great thing about the Radisson New World is its location. Its at one end of the Nanjing Road - one of the main commercial streets in Shanghai. Its a 10-15 minute walk to the Bund, which is great. You're also on two tube lines, which is ideal for shooting around the city - and means you can very easily get to the hotel from the airport by way of public transport (Maglev train, tube, 2 minute walk - very quick). We had a fine stay - the hotel staff were able to check us in as soon as we arrived (despite it being 8am in the morning) which was just what we needed after a long flight. The room was smart, the bed comfy, and the shower excellent. Oh, and the sky-dome bar at the top of the hotel does good cocktails. Highly recommended. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Very central We stayed at the Radisson New World in Shanghai for 2 nights on our honeymoon. The rooms were very nice, plenty of space with a nice bathroom. The concierge was very helpful in getting us tickets to see The Lion King at the Shanghai Grand Theatre.The hotel is in the direct centre of the Puxi (west side of the city). It is directly across from Renmin Peoples park (there is a subway stop about 50m from the hotel), and just off the corner from Nanjing Lu walking street. It's about a 15 minute walk along Nanjing Lu to the Bund (river shore). The hotel staff spoke very good English and were able to recommend places to go. We had dinner in the hotel one night which was priced to match western budgets, about what I'd expect to pay in a normal restaurant. Just a small warning, I made the mistake of having Perrier bottled water instead of normal bottled water, which ended up costing me $15 Australian for 2 small bottles.There's a revolving restaurant on the 44th floor with great views out over the city and the park, and on the 45th floor (top) there is a glass domed bar, which is great for a late night drink and has a very relaxed feel.The hotel was excellent, especially with the cheap rate directly from the radisson website. If you are looking for something in the centre then this would be the place. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Excellent hotel in excellent location We stayed here 19/20 Sept 2006. The location is outstanding - 15 minutes walk to the Bund via a lively shopping area, and right opposite the metro station for an easy ride beneath the river to the TV tower etc. The hotel itself was really comfortable. We requested a room on a high floor, and on arrival were upgraded to a club room (but without the club loung access). It had a terrific view - worth requesting a high floor looking towards the Bund or the Shopping area. We also ate one night in the revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel because it had some vegetarian options. We had an excellent dinner (black lentil curry recommended for any Vegetarians) and some very cold beer and a great view of Shanghai - and although expensive for China, it was a reasonable price meal. The room price was very good and I think the location is unbeatable so can highly recommend this hotel. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Much to be improved Good location. But the rooms are rather small. The front desk staff including the on-duty managers showed little interest in helping, and were not as friendly as you would expect from a decent-class international-chain hotel. To our surprise, they were not really aware of loyalty programs associated with Radisson. We will definitely choose another hotel next time, as there are a plenty of them with good locations in Shanghai. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Only for location We stayed at this hotel from Sept 20-24. It was a let down compared to our stay at the Grand Hyatt in Beijing. The only thing I liked about this hotel was its location, as it was right on Nanjing road and next to its pedestrian section. We stayed on the club floor. The check in at the club level was very slow as the staff did not appear experienced. We booked dinner reservation through the club concierge to eat at Epicure 45 (extremely overpriced, poor food quality and service), their restaurant on the top floor. We asked for a table by the window, were told all the tables were by the window. When we showed up, we were told there was no table by the window for us and would have to wait about 1 hour. It was very difficult trying to communicate with the staff as they were not fluent in English. We ate breakfast at Window on the Park, asked for a table in the non-smoking section and were placed, of course, at the smoking section. The value for the club is only worth it as it gets you a room on a high floor. Ours was on the 32nd floor and we can still hear the noise from the street. As well, our room faced the park and there is a construction site going on. The hallway leading to our room had a very strong smell as well -something similar to what you smell in an old place in Europe ( old wood?). The lobby was very tacky as well. The room was standard although the bathroom was very big. The pool was OK and the whirlpool was colder than the pool. I will not give this hotel more than 3 stars. If you don't mind being a little bit away from the center of the action, you'll get more value for your money by staying at the 4 Seasons, the JW Marriott (very close to the Radisson by the way)or even at the Grand Hyatt in Pudong just for the experience. I will not stay at the Radisson in Shanghai again. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Location The location of this hotel is probably its strongest point. Staff at reception still need to master the art of customer care and realise that it isn't a crime to smile. By contrast, the concierge staff was very friendly and helpful.A useful tip is that at the rear of the hotel, there is a small store called Lawsons that sells bottled water, beer, pepsi etc. at very reasonable prices. It really was a handy place to know about.Because the hotel has been squeezed into such a small gap, it isn't the prettiest place you will ever stay in, the lobby in particular is very uninspiring. Also it wasn't cheap but like I said, its location means that most tourist sights are not very far away. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,Lived up to iits ranking We chose this hotel for a three-night stop on our way back from London to Melbourne. We did so on the basis that it was ranked no 1 on the Tripadviser list of Shanghai hotels. It fully justified this ranking and was excellent in every way. 
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Good hotel but very tacky! No Style. Firstly let me preface my review by saying there is nothing ‘wrong’ with the hotel. Its new, clean and the staff are very friendly. The rooms are also great, albeit your stock standard 5 star hotel room found in most Radissons around the world. However…. I was a little surprised when I arrived at the hotel. I booked it specifically based on the recommendations on this site. Firstly the lobby is ghastly. Its just outright ugly with masses of beige marble and gold. If I ever were to be invited to Donatella Versace’s home this is how I picture it to be. This is fine if that’s what you’re into but I am not. I found the lobby to smell a bit as well. I am not sure if it’s the chlorine in the water fountain next to the small bar there or the general cleaning products that they use but that was a bit off putting to walk into that smell. I did go up to the restaurant on the 45th floor to take a look. Great view although I think the ‘revolving restaurant’ idea was a bit more popular about 20 years ago. We didn’t eat there though as I am always wary of a place that serves something for everyone but specialises in nothing. Japanese, Chinese, European and Indian were the four on the menu that I can remember, all in the same restaurant. The rooms themselves are fine and I cannot fault them.The other thing I didn’t like was the location. Personally I thought the road down to the Bund was horrific. A tacky mall void of any soul or decent restaurants. Actually generally the whole area where the hotel is was pretty poor I thought apart from the museum etc. Personally next time I would stick to the French Quarter, Jingan or south of the French Quarter which I believe are closer to better shopping and bars and restaurants. Again please don’t get upset that I found the hotel tacky. As I said the hotel was generally fine but I am just warning others who may like their hotels to have some style. Oh and if you are into style check out places like ‘Yongfoo Elite’, ‘People 7’, ‘Yaris’, ‘T8’, ‘Glamour Bar’, and ‘Jean Georges’. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"perfect stay I stayed in the Radisson new world hotel for three nights in the middle of August. I did have a &quot;1 King Bed Non Smoking Club Deluxe Room-Sitting area-39sqm&quot; which is part of the Radisson club and located on the top floors.The service was perfect. The staff of the club lounge took care of every request and could solve all of them. The room was very nice, spacious and clean. Swimming pool is good to relax and cool of in the hot summer days. Spa offers good relaxing service.The location is perfect in the city centre with goo views to the bund. (rooms from 01, 02, 13 and 14 have the best direction to the bund. The others are looking out in the other ways of the round tower.) Subway and people's place is direct in front of the hotel. And the night life places are also close, which means you don't need a long taxi ride to get back for sleep.I have tryed various other hotels in Shanghai before but this is the best until now and for sure my choice on the next stay. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Great Stay We stayed here from July 23 to 25. This was the last leg of our trip to China, so we thought we'd spoil ourselves by staying here. We weren't disappointed. Check-in was easy as all the front staff spoke english. We booked a Deluxe Room. These rooms have a corner suite entrance that holds the writing desk, bar fridge, and an LCD TV. The bedroom has a regular TV. The bathrooms are very nice as they have separate shower and bath. Room is nicely decorated, fully equipped and the bed was very soft.Renmin Park is just across from the hotel, which marks the west end of the the pedestrian-only zone.The hotel is connected to the the New World Mall, which houses a Sega Entertainment Center and a Madame Tussaud Wax Museum.I never tried any of the restaurants in the hotel, as it seemed a little pricey, but there are dozens of places to eat nearby that are greatThe hotel is near the Renmin Metro Station, which made it easy to get to the Maglev station to take to Pudong Airport. This is supposed to be the fastest train in the world. I watched it clock at 425km/hr at it's top speed, and it only took 6-7 minutes to get from the Maglev station to the airport. Overall, the hotel was very nice, and the price was good at the time I booked it. But since the hotel has hit it's one year anniversary, I think the price may start going higher now. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Pretty good hotel I spent 4 nights at the Radisson New World in July 2006 and I had a very pleasant experience.The Radisson is centrally located (Nanjing Rd. opposite to Renmin Square) and has an undergroud station deserved by the two main lines just in front of it. Rooms are spatious and clean, the staff speaks English fluently and they are helpful most times, although we found a lost cellphone and gave it to one of the receptionists to locate the owner and we never found out what happened with the phone, no matter whom we asked about it.The price is reasonable (especially if you consider location and additional services - swimming pool, gym, etc.-), but it is not cheap for Chinese standards. Room service, massage and the restaurant were absurdely expensive for China, not just compared to street prices, but also compared to similar category hotels in Beijing. There are several restaurants near the hotel and there is a convenience store and a massage salon just behind it (with prices 3-4 times cheaper than the hotel). "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Exceeded expectations Booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and was not disappointed. Hotel has a great location in the center of nanjing road. Hotel is new and well decorated. Marble and crystal chandelier dominate the lobby. Reasonably priced for this high category hotel.We had a 2 room suite with a separate office area. Perks included free high speed internet, marble bathroom, 2 televisions. Television in office area was a flat screen type. Only downside was average hotel food although we did not try all of the restaurants. All in all very pleased with this hotel choice. "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Perfect Hotel with top notch service My wife and I stayed at the Radisson Hotel New World Shanghai (not to be confused with the other Shanghai Radisson) from July 26th to July 30th, 2006 and thought our stay was perfect. So if you are new to Shanghai, need a business hotel, or are unclear as to where to stay - stay here as it offers a tremendous location, impeccable service, and fantastic views.I do quite a lot corporate and personal travel and was originally put off by this hotel since I was a bit snobby about procuring the a better &quot;brand name&quot; hotel (even after reading the online reviews on Trip Advisior.com). Yet, I have to admit it the Radisson Shanghai has probably the best service I have ever experienced. I paid approximately $215/night + tax for a &quot;deluxe room&quot; (number 3401) that offered a downtown view to the Bund and Peal tower, complementary Asian and western breakfast with fresh local fruit, guava juice etc, evening appetizers with fresh sashimi salmon and caviar, mixed drinks (great gin and tonic) and use of the pool area. The view of our room and amenities in it were quite spectacular considering the price we paid. Our room was perfect complete with floor to ceiling windows, river/Bund view, quiet, king size bed, complementary chocolates. We had a separate office suite with desk, view and flat screen TV. The bathroom was very nice with separate shower, tub, toilet and good counter space to hold your amenities (my wife loved the bath as it had Bund views). If you swim, the hotel had quite 20 meter amazing pool and an outdoor deck where you can enjoy a view of Peoples Park (aka Shanghai’s Central park New York). There was also a sauna, steam room and men’s Jacuzzi.The hotel location offered walking access to Nanjing road (neon signed shopping), French concession (high end shopping), People’s Park, Bund, Opera house (currently Lion King is playing) and the Shanghai art museum (very nice actually).In summary, this hotel made our stay in Shanghai very enjoyable, and we wished we could move to the hotel permanently! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Best hotel we stayed in in China! My daughter and I stayed here for two nights recently - booked the day before on the hotel website. We were upgraded on arrival to an executive room with superb facilities - separate working/sitting area with plasma TV, twin bedroom, not overlarge, but well-equipped and unusually comfortable beds- and, best of all for two weary female travellers, a wonderful bathroom! The bath was huge and deep, the shower was just enormous!! The hotel is new, so all furnishings and fitments were immaculate. The only downside was that our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking a large construction site, but there was little noise distrubance - and we were so tired we slept like logs anyway! I mentioned this slight noise disturbance in my comments form on departure, and was impressed to get a personal email reply and apology from the Manager when I got home.(The construction isnt his fault!)The decor of the main hotel areas was a bit too glitzy for our personal taste - polished gold etc! But everywhere was immaculately clean, staff were always helpful and the restaurant and other facilities were first class. I thought it superb value for money.I chose the hotel, as usual, from tripadvisor recommendations, mainly for the location. We were two women travelling independently in China, Shanghai was our last stop, and I wanted a convenient location, and some comfort. This was exactly what we got. The hotel overlooks Renmin Square, a pleasant green park and a real oasis of calm in a very hot, humid, hectic city! Shanghai Museum is a five minute walk away through the park; a wonderful museum, not too large, that will give you an overview of Chinese history and culture in less than two hours! (Note that last tickets for entry are at 4pm)There is also a good modern art museum at the edge of the park (turn right out of the hotel). At the top of this is Kathy5, a good , inexpensive restaurant with a European menu; and, best of all, it has an outdoor terrace overlooking the park. Good for lunch or dinner.The hotel has a direct entry into the New World department store next door, and is at the end of the pedestrian part of the Nanjing Road, if you want shopping - though we preferred the smaller shops in the French Concession area. The subway stop is right in front of the hotel (Renmin Square, exit 8); we used this to get around, but also took taxis as they were so cheap.On the last evening we took a one hour cruise on the river from the Bund - it worked out that we had by chance timed it that we started out in daylight and by the time we returned the sun had set and all the amazing lights were on in the buildings on the Bund and the skyscrapers- highly recommended. We ended up with a cocktail or two in the Cloud 9 bar on the 87th floor of the Hyatt hotel in the Jinmao tower - looking down on these tiny specks of buildings we had been looking up at before - amazing!To get to the airport we wanted to use the Maglev and could have used the subway to get there, but by then were laden down with shopping, so got a taxi to the Maglev station. It would possibly have been more convenient to get a taxi all the way to the airport, but the Maglev was an experience - all 7 minutes of it!Shanghai was fascinating, so different from places like Beijing and Xian and the countryside we travelled in, where we kept getting our photos taken as there were so few European faces around! I'd love to see more of it - but not in July when it was far too hot and humid. And I'd definitely stay at the Radisson- though I think the secret is out now that it's a fantastic choice for tourists or businessmen alike!!! It may not be so easy to book in the future! "
radisson hotel shanghai new world ,"Amazing but watch out for the massage The hotel is fantastic! Room, food, location, staff, pool, everything is perfect. But we had some problems at the SPA. We went for a massage and staff there kept pushing us the expensiver one, although we said we wanted to do chinese massage. This during the massage, every ten minutes... To my husband they offered some other &quot;services&quot;. But anyway we've reported this to the manager, he apologized and did not charge us anything.Hint: have a dinner on the 45th floor, food and view are great! "

radisson plaza xing guo ,"Great place to stay - comfortable rooms tasty food great service! Some of the best parts of this hotel: the fitness center and spa is well-kept, there are individual televisions for the elliptical machines, and even yoga and judo classes offered. The pool, according to one of my colleagues, was very clean but over-chlorinated.The breakfast buffet is wonderful: you can go Asian, go American, go British, go Japanese... there's everything. Dim sum, omlettes, pancakes, French toast, melon, mangoes, corned beef hash, smoked salmon, salad, banana bread, croissants, cereals, juices.... the list goes on. One warning - there is a smoking section, as there are still plenty of smokers in the world that need to be catered to. The smoke DOES waft over occassionally to the non-smoking section, but hey, nothing's perfect.The rooms are very clean, luxurious bedding (I wanted to take home the pillows!), nice decor, flat screen TVs, transitional/modern fixtures, free wifi... I only gave four stars for the room because one time, I came back to my room, and the gentleman cleaning the room was obviously sick - sniffling and coughing all over the place. Not wanting to get sick during my stay, I was understandably dismayed by the germs he was spreading while cleaning the faucets, counters, etc. I wanted someone to reclean the room after he left!Since cabs are so inexpensive (literally, $3-5 to most places!), the location is fine. Be careful of where your room is, though; since the hotel is at a well-travelled fork of sorts, the traffic horns in the morning can wake you up (if you want to sleep in.)The hotel has a park, along with a convention hall/center and several villas. I went for a jog throughout, and though it was short, it was wonderful to have so much greenery on hand in the middle of a such an industrial and bustling city.I suggest that anyone travelling to this hotel, and to Shanghai in general, take a little pocket Engligh-Chinese dictionary, and maybe even take some Chinese CDs from the library before travelling. English is not spoken widely, so past &quot;hello!&quot; and &quot;thank you!&quot;, a lot of the staff, like approximately 75%, didn't know what I meant when I asked for a pharmacy, a drug store, or place to buy medicine. But charades goes a long way!The concierge desk was come and go; the head concierge is extremely knowledgeable, but the others are iffy. Make sure you have them write down on a card where you intend to go in Chinese, so you can show this card to the taxi driver.Bon voyage! "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Hotel Agreable In a nace garden place, this hotel will be very nice for any kind of stay. Do no hesitate to go there ...My critc might be hard, but it is suppose to be a high class hotel ... "
radisson plaza xing guo ,Superb setting We enjoyed our four-night stay here in 2008. The park surrounding the hotel is ideal for a before-breakfast or after-dinner stroll. The hotel itself is excellent - try the Chinese restaurant. 
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Great hotel shame about the location Spent two nights at this hotel during a business trip. If it weren't for the location, there would be absolutely nothing to complain about. The rooms are clean, pretty big and offer everything you need. Bathrooms are also clean, large and there's a good selection of different toiletries. And there's free internet in the rooms, tea making facilities&lt; complimentery mineral water, well-stocked mini-bar, etc. - everything you'd expect.The breakfast buffet offers a lot of options, both asian and western fare. And you should try the dinner buffet - there aren't that many options, but if you like sea food you'll love it. I also oredered food from room service and it was hit-and-miss - great soup, but dissapointing noodles - but the prices were pretty modarate for this class of hotel.The receprion staff was very helpful, they wrote down the places I needed to go in chinese, so that I wouldn't have any problems with taxi drivers.The only downside is the location - yeah, the park setting is great, but if you want to do any sightseeing all the main attractions are pretty far and you have to take a taxi. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"mediocre The location is great for walking in the residential former French Concession, and the green park surrounding it is nice... but for international hotel rates you get very limited Chinese service... poor English from operators and front desk people... very mediocre but expensive Western food from room service, and tired room decor. Free internet was VERY slow, and kept cutting out. Everything was beige. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Very nice hotel in the French Concessions This is a very nice hotel, located in the French Concession, our favorite part of Shanghai. We have stayed at this hotel many times and can particularly recommend the club floor, where the before dinner drinks and snacks are really good.It is a quite hotel situated in a small park, so ask for park veiw to secure some green scenery from your window. The low rise quarters surrounding the hotel have nice restaurants and cafees and makes the ground for some good walks.It is a 4 star hotel, a little flossy in the corners, but nice and clean rooms and an excellent breakfast buffet. So with respect to price, this is a top level experience. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Good not the best location This is a newer hotel with very comfortable rooms. I have only had breakfast in the dining areas, which was included in the room rate and also very good. This hotel sits on what I think was once a government compound and the grounds are large and very well maintained. It is relaxing to walk the grounds after a days work. There are no restaurants close by but a short taxi ride gets me to Heng Shan Lu and a lot of western restaurants and bars. My favorite is Omally's which some say has the best burger in Shanghai. For me this is a good choice for a hotel, but there are so many to choose from and at many different prices from very high to reasonable. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"All in all a 4 star experience but could improve... The hotel has great rooms in a nice quiet setting. The restaurants were lacking however and the executive lounge was a smoke fest at night. The hotel had the best workout room I have experienced in Shanghai and yes I have stayed at the Shangri-La :). It is close to Xintiandi and about 20 minutes from the Bund. I will stay there again, but make sure to note restaurants in the area. Simply Thai was one good lunch option and I am found of New Heights on the bund. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"A Good Hotel We stayed at the Radisson Xing Guo in late August . Our family of five includes children aged 15, 13 and 9. My sister in law was also with us. We found the location to be quite acceptable. The walk for us to the subway took about 15 minutes. And subway line 2 took us very quickly to most tourist attractions. The hotel has a nice pool. Food was fine. We purchased air tickets through the business office at a rate that seemed to match that offered on ctrip so I doubt we paid too much of a fee. In fact the hotel left an envelope with some cash in it in our room when the air tickets ended up costing less than the agreed upon price.Our reservations did not include free breakfast on the last day. But the hotel waived the charge even though we argued with them that we should be paying.Our only very minor complaint was that the concierge was not aware that the Museum of Science and Technology was closed (Monday) the day we asked him about going there. This may be unfair as it was primarily our responsibility to check this out.All in all, a very nice stay. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Nice Room and Pleasant Stay We stayed at the Radisson Shanghai Xing Guo Hotel as part of a group tour package that included visits to Beijing, Xian, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The Radisson is a very pleasant hotel near the area of Shanghai known as the French Concession (or French Quarter). The hotel is modern and nicely appointed, but a bit far from a subway stop and the center of the tourist action in Shanghai. Since we were part of a group tour, the distance was not a problem since we did not have any free time to taxi into the central city area anyway. Had we free time in the evenings, then we would have had to catch a taxi since subway stations were about a 30 minute walk away from the hotel (nearest stations: Line 2 Jiangsu Lu or Line 1 Heng Shan Lu). The shops and restaurants of the French Concession might have been an evening diversion we could have considered, but our tour itinerary did not allow for much exploration and therefore we did not attempt to walk it from the hotel. The hotel is set in a cluster of old colonial style villas and a park, in keeping with the area's French colonial history. It would have been nice to walk the grounds, but time did not permit. Staff were very professional and willing to help. Our room was nicely appointed and very comfortable for 2 persons. It probably had every amenity I would have wanted and a lot of work went into the details to fit out the room for the guests. Our bathroom was ample and nicely appointed as well with a ton of marble and mirrors to make one feel like one of those new Shanghai millionaires. Our package included daily buffet breakfast and this was excellent. As in most hotels in China, the offerings included a wide selection of both western and asian breakfast dishes in a sunny and beautifully appointed dining room. The Radisson offered a large indoor swimming pool, huge work out area, and even a 6 lane bowling alley. This is a hotel that is good for business travellers who don't mind taking taxis and for families who would stay put on the property to enjoy the onsite amenities offered. If I return to Shanghai on my own, then I would likely book at a hotel closer to People's Square, the Bund, or possibly near a subway stop in order to access the restaurants, shopping and night life that Shanghai is famous for. The Radisson would be a bit out of the way to access these things via subway. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"A tad far but nice rooms The hotel is a bit far from the city centre and the main cluster of the big name hotels. Most taxi drivers don't know this hotel so remember the address and preferably the road junction in Mandarin. The main entrance of the hotel is located inside the park/grass area, so you will have to direct the taxi driver around the bends until you find the lobby.The rooms are reasonable size with a comfortable king size bed. The room and bathroom are clean (I'm quite picky about cleanliness!). They gave the usual cable channels on TV and free bottles of water in the room which is replenished each day.The breakfast is very standard hotel breakfast, there is a good selection of food, but not very tasty. At least they have a chef standing by to cook your eggs how/when you want them. The staffs are not particularly helpful, but will answer your questions/help you make a reservation at a restaurant if you ask. But don't expect them to help you plan your day or have in depth knowledge of the city.If I went back to Shanghai again, probably won't stay here because it's a bit out of the way and it's a hassle to take the taxi every time you want to go out. The taxis are cheap (meter starts at RMB 11 and takes forever for the meter to jump compared to other Asian city taxis), but sometimes there is heavy traffic jams and the cars just DON'T move!! But the hotel is nice and located in the French Concession area which is very tranquil and quite a lovely area of Shanghai. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Great Hotel! Would go back again!!! We visited Shanghai on business and I was given the responsibility of planning our whole trip. Considering I am not well travelled and knowing that we were going to be in China for two whole weeks, I knew that comfort and security were important. To be honest, I made reservations at the Radisson Plaza Xing Guo based off of price. I knew it was a little further from downtown but since we were in China for business and not pleasure, that was not of real importance to us. Hotels that are downtown near the Bund or along the banks of the Huangpu tend to be in the $250 - $350 USD range which I thought was ridiculous!!! We were a short 10-15 minute car ride away from the downtown core. The hotel overall was very lovely. An impressive foyer, attentive staff etc. We arrived the day Typhoon Wipha hit Shanghai so our original room reservation was impacted by this since the person who had the room the night before chose to stay an extra few nights to wait out the storm. Lucky for us - we were upgraded to the suites which were really breathtaking! HUGE room, HUGE bathroom, HUGE bed! The bathroom in my room was really spectacular. Marble, gold, granite, tub, shower etc etc. The room was clean, bright, relaxing etc. Bottled water is complimentary in the room. We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was really quite lovely. The restaurant staff were also very attentive and were quick to remove dishes once we were done with them. Our driver and translator were quick to inform us that we had picked an interesting hotel since this hotel is more apt to have foreign diplomats and government officials than foreign business people at their hotel. From what we saw of the grounds, they were really lovely. If it wasn't typhoon weather for the 3 days we were there, we would have walked around the grounds and explored the gorgeously manicured gardens they had as well. Only minor complaint was when we arrived for check in it took a little prodding to get us the upgrade. After being on an airplane for 16 hours and sitting in Shanghai traffic for another hour plus, we did not have the energy to battle with the front desk staff. Lucky for us, the translator we hired saved the day and pushed to get us to our rooms for a brief rest before dinner. All in all, best bang for your buck near downtown Shanghai. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Nice location This hotel is in a nice quiet location in Shanghai in a rather attractive part of town. The grounds are expansive but they are dotted with buildings and dont really qualify as a 'garden'. The rooms are neat and adequately equipped. The level of service depends upon the member of the staff you draw. I have had service that was really excellent especially in the Li Palace resturant, to the indifferent - particularly at the front desk. Be warned that not all of the staff speak english and this can be quite trying.The food in the Li Palace is fabulous and the staff are very helpful. The buffet breakfast provides a huge variety and you can have a satisfying meal though not all of the food on offer is made well. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"nice hotel Very nice hotel, very confortable, very nice pool area.We had reserved by internet and PREPAID the room. But we arrived at the hotel at 10:30 pm and our room was no more available. So they put us in the suite for the first night and we had to change rooms for the rest of our stay !!Internet is 20 dollars per hour !!The hotel is noisy (street noise) and not in the center but the staff is very good and pleasant, the rooms very confortable and the pool is great. So it was a good stay. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Business stay Stayed for a business meeting. Rooms are nice - stayed in the &quot;Jr. Suite&quot; with Plaza Club use ( as an executive club, it is pretty plain but the service is good. The standard guest room, while nice, was small, but clean. Jr. Suite room about equal to the Shang. I would stay here again. The service crew for our business meeting was excellent. Food at hotel was excellent as well. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Great hotel in Shanghai We stayed at this property for 3 nights in July 2006 with our 3 and 5 year old daughters. The bathroom was large and very clean with a huge tub. We had two beds that were very comfortable. The TV got many foreign channels. Here are a couple of points:1) the hotel has a great pool and gym. I got a massage there that was ok, not great. The floor near the pool is very slippery, so be careful. The pool is very clean and was great to spend time at. There is also a deck off the exerce room. 2) location. It was 100 degress plus when we were in Shanghai, so we didn't explore the surrounding area very much on foot. We didn't go to any of the shopping centers either, but there are stores in the area if you are willing to take a cab.3) staff: The level of English is pretty good.4) food: very good. the breakfast buffet is great and you can always get diet coke with ice :) We ate at the hotel 3 nights for dinner and the food was excellent and we are very picky. Not too pricy either.We really liked this hotel and highly recommend it. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"A Lovely Boutique Hotel I did an extensive research and picked Radisson Plaza as our hotel in Shanghai as the 15-acre garden may serve the playground for our young kids. As a matter of fact, the garden not only provides a great view for the rooms in the front, but also filters out the noises inherent in this over populated city. The service was friendly, yet could be more energetic. The breakfast is a great combination of Western and Chinese food, providing our kids a jump start daily. I just wish the rooms could be as spacious as the bathrooms. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"The Best Hotel I have stayed in many luxury properties, but this hotel is the best. Prepare to be pampered in 5 start luxury. Location is also very conveniant. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"LOVED IT! We stayed three nights in april. We are so happy we chose this hotel. In the begining we tried to go to the Westin as there was an internet offer and we tought location was better but could not do it because of some problems with the credit car. This hotel is excellent and, contrary to what we thought, location is not a problem as you anyway have to take a taxi everywhere in Shanghai and they are very cheap. There are excellent restaurants around. Hotel staff were excellent and always treated us great and give us very good advice. We made the reservation through Raddisson web site and breakfast was included. Breakfast was very good. The hotel was very nice, it did not seem crowded. "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"A treat! Travelling as a single mom with children is not always easy. At most more exclusive hotels, you will not be treated with respect. Unfortunately. Radisson Plaza Xing Guo is an exception. The location might not be the very best, although there are some very good restaurants and great shopping close by. But everything else is almost perfect. Food is fantastic, especially the Sunday Champagne Brunch. Breakfast buffet is very good. Staff is very helpful and service-minded. Pool and gym are of the highest standards and rooms are spacious and comfortable. But best of all: it is one of the rather few hotels with a high standard where they treat people equally! And make you feel genuinely welcome, even if you happen to be a single mom! "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"What a nice surprise! We just returned from a 14 day China tour and the best hotel was the Radisson Plaza Shanghai! The hotel is located in the beautiful Frenchtown section of Shanghai. Although you need to take a cab to most restaurants or shopping districts, the cost will be minimal. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and the buffet breakfast was the best with many choices Asian and Western style.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to this property!! "
radisson plaza xing guo ,"Best kept secret in Shanghai This hotel is great, in a very cool, quiet, gardenesque setting for urban Shanghai. The hotel is in, or on the border of, the French Concession. It's not the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, but its much better than the Hilton or Regal... and if you plan to be in Puxi and not Pudong, it is much better located than the Grand Hyatt or Shangri-la. I stay here all the time, as I am in Shanghai quite a bit, and we have a corp rate with the hotel. Do not be put off the by the fact that it is a Radisson! I usually prefer Four Seasons, Ritz, Mandarin Oriental class hotels, but since I spend so much time in Shanghai, i can't be dropping $300 a night 15 nights a month. This place really is a hidden gem in Shanghai and is quite good value. "

rainbow hotel shanghai ,"Japan-China youth friendship tour! i went to Shanghai and stayed at this rainbow hotel, and i think it was pretty good, compared to the other hotels in China. This hotel provides English staffs(some even speak Japanese) so we had no problem staying here. Theres also a Japanese supermarket nearby. "
rainbow hotel shanghai ,Basics Hotel I was visiting Shanghai to take part in the exhibition and chose this Hotel as it was close to the exhibition venue. Its an economical hotel fairly popular with business travellers. Don't expect too much luxury but you'd get the basics at an economical rate. Sad part is Internet not being free which is a must for a business traveller. Though you can use the business centre services for free. A big plus point is a commercial gym and swimming pool which you can use for free. 
rainbow hotel shanghai ,"My Shanghai Home I have stayed at the Rainbow 6 or 7 times now, and I keep coming back, so they must be doing something right.Rooms are always nice and big, very clean with everything you need. Only annoying thing (but I think this is in Chinese hotels generally), never have an iron in the room, but to be fair always bring one quickly.For a Shanghai hotel of this class not too expensive, I pay around RMB 575 for a deluxe double. However, that's where the value stops. Food, and particularly drink, is very expensive. I had a 1 litre bottle of water and got stung for GBP 7.00. A small glass of red was the same. Bar menu is pretty bland, which I find amazing in a country with the cuisine of China. Although there is a dumpy little restaurant opposite where the taxis park, and the food here is superb, and dirt cheap. Most staff are pretty helpful, but generally never smile, so that does put a bit of a downer on things.Having said all of this, for me it is my Shanghai home. It is convenient, clean, good facilities and does not break the bank, unless you spend all your time in the bar. I have never had any real problems here, and you only need to ask for anything and it is sorted.Would certainly recommend it, and I will continue to use it as I have done on my last few trips. "
rainbow hotel shanghai ,"Rainbow was just ok... After travelling first to Beijing and having a terrific experience, I had high expectations for the Rainbow in Shanghai. Apparently this was at one time one of the finer hotels in the Honqiao area. I must say I was a little disappointed. Here is a list of the good and bad of our 5 night stay:The Good:-Rooms were clean-Washrooms were clean and well kept-Walking distance to INTEX (Exhibition Centre)-Beautiful lobby with a great Tailor shop (Mr. Tong)The Bad:-Poor room service (bad menu and the supposed hot food was cold)-Exterior is poorly maintained including the fountain-A MOUSE ran through the Lotus Pavilion Restaurant while we were eating dinner-VERY BAD and expensive in-room internet connection (UP to 90 RMB/day)-Unfriendly staff and not very helpful-Shower ran out of hot water several times-AC BARELY worked. We cooled down in the lobby before going to our roomIn all I guess this hotel is not really geared toward westerners. I have stayed in worse places but I would not stay here again. The Galaxy next door or the Mayfield are better options in this area. Or spend the extra dollars and stay at the Hilton or Sheraton. "
rainbow hotel shanghai ,Good hotel at a great price Stayed at the Rainbow Hotel for 1 night. Good size rooms and good service. Excellent value for money as I got deluxe room for CNY750. Only drawback is a bit far from Bund but taxis are very very cheap so you are never more than 15 minutes away from anywhere.

ramada plaza pudong ,Great weekend! We spent a delightful time in the Presidential Suite and I recommend this hotel highly as the service is excellent and the General Manager and his lovely wife are very charming hosts! 
ramada plaza pudong ,"Superb Hotel We never expected Ramada to be so luxurious. We were ther 3 nights for business and were very impressed.The staff was amazing friendly and helpful, i had never seen such an extended breakfast. The Hotel is not the most modern hotel I have seen but they make up for it with their friendly staff and services. The room is very comfortable, big TV with CNN, HBO, AXn and other western movie channels and what I always find important is a spacious and clean bathroom.If you want to stay in Pudong the hotel is definitely worth the room rate. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"An example of excellence!! L.s.I travelled with a partner / colleague of mine to Hong Kong and later to Shanghai and we were both surprisingly treated with one of the best hotel services we experienced since a long time in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. The hotel staff went all the way in their efforts to make our stay a pleasant and comfortable one. Their attention to detail was extreme and we can only recommend this hotel to everyone visiting this region of China, as a business visitor or as a tourist. Thank you ‘Ramada Plaza Pudong Shanghai. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Smelly rooms noisy elevators got back home sick... Typical Chinese business hotel, but business only. Room was smelly, no decent western television, elevators were very noisy and on my way back home I already had to take some asperine in the plane because of having become sick. Staff are ok, but nothing more than that. Food was good, but hey - where isn't food good in China? The location is ok, but if you pay just a little bit more a stay at the Pudong Renaissance a bit down the road is well worth the extra RMBs! "
ramada plaza pudong ,"everything I expected This was my first stay in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. It is everything you expect as a business traveller. Reasonable close to the ariport, good, clean rooms, enough fitness/relax possibilities, friendly people.. Price/quality is also ok. I will certainly return.Jan Verschroeven, Maasmechelen, Belgium "
ramada plaza pudong ,"not worth the room rate We were there last week for business and we stayed Monday-Friday, prime reason we picked this hotel was because it was near to our customer's factory, and it was the only reason that kept us there, By Friday afternoon we couldn't wait to get out quick enough... the place was dated and furnitures old and tired, the bed was so hard we had back pain after the first night, the water that came out of the bathroom tap had an awful odor, and for me what was unforgivable was that they had no hot water - imagine a luke warm bath or shower after a long hard working day... We will not return there again next time we visit our customer, we could have paid cheaper to stay elsewhere. Staff attitude was OK, but couldn't make up for the unpleasant stay. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Catch the pulse of Shanghai If u wana be in the city centre, in sync with the beat..this is a nice place to stay, just dont go there looking for tranquility. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Stay here if location is right for your business seek alternate location for pleasure I stayed here for 4 nights with my wife in May. She was traveling for business while I went along with her for pleasure. We extended her business trip into a vacation to Vietnam. This hotel was recommended by her employer's Shanghai office since it was across the street. I would recommend this hotel for business but not for pleasure. We were put on the executive floor with an &quot;executive lounge&quot; serving overpriced beverages and snacks. For my pleasure side of life, I had to take a cab to get to the subway so that I could then get around the city to more interesting places. The life around this hotel feels oddly suburban, as it is surrounded by a western type business park full of western companies, apartment towers. If you stay here and your company is not paying, buy your water and beer at the Family Mart down the street where it costs 10% of what it does in the hotel.This hotel location does have a few western places to eat nearby, but there are some more interesting places in Shanghai. We actually stayed 1 additional night in Shanghai during a 22 hour layover at the end of our trip. This time we stayed at the Pudong Courtyard Marriott and it was a much nicer room, slightly more interesting street life, and for a comparable weekday rate, it was 20-30% less money this this Ramada. "
ramada plaza pudong ,END OF THE TRIP this hotel is really very good with a lot of comfort.It was the end of my trip in China and I was pleased by the quality of the room .There is a very good shop for the last shopping 
ramada plaza pudong ,"Great hotels especially for long stay guests This hotel is located outside the busy, crowded and noisy downtown area. Located in JinQiao an more expat area with lots of restaurants (I counted 40 within 1 mile from the hotel). The area is nice, green and quiet, so more or less the opposite of downtown. Still downtown is not far away, by taxi 10km or go to Science &amp; Technology (/ FakeMarket) (±6km) and take the Subway from there.The restaurants of the hotel (1 chinese 1 large 2 openkitchen (Western / Italian &amp; Japanese Restaurant) are great and the breakfast is huge. For breakfast you have a choice between a large western variety or a large asian variety, both are great. Staff is really polite and helpful.The hotel also offers a lot of meeting / business rooms and because it's located in the New Import &amp; Export Business Center, ideal for long stay guests.I would deffinetly recomment this to my friends !! "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Excellent Hotel I stayed at this hotel for my business travel to China. Our office is nearer, which is main advantage to select this hotel. This is also not so far from airport (may be 30-45 minutes).Rooms are great and views from the room are also wonderful. Food is good, and services are better. It has nearby an Indian restaurant which solves problem for vegetarian guys like me.Per night it costs about 1000 RMB. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Your basic business hotel The hotel provides basic traveler services. The breakfast is actually quite good (and came free with my room). There is a basic gym and decent pool. The staff are reasonably helpful. Unlike others, I don't seem to have had a communication problem.The internet service also came free with my room; however, it was a bit unreliable.The rooms are large and clean &amp; the bed is comfortable (maybe a bit too comfortable!).The biggest down-side for this hotel is that to get to Shanghai you need to take a 20RMB taxi ride of 15-20 minutes--just to get to the metro. If you want a taxi into the PuXi section of Shanghai (where all the tourist stuff is), it takes longer and costs much more. I typically did the metro thing as the metro is fast, clean, safe, and doesn't ask me if I want a &quot;massagee&quot;. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Value for money questionable Stayed here for 5 nights whilst on business in Shanghai. Booked into the executive floor &amp; used the Upper Deck Lounge for checking in &amp; out.Upper Deck Lounge totally lacked atmosphere &amp; was very basic. Girls on the desk were pleasant, but not all had great english, causing a level of confusion.Efficient service in the bars, but again both bars seemed to lack atmosphere. The main one appeared to be used just prior to guests heading out for the evening or for a night cap.My bedroom was very spacious, clean &amp; comfortable. No complaints at all in this area. High speed internet access also available in the room.Ate breakfast in the main buffet restaurant daily &amp; found the choice &amp; quality to be very good. Ate lunch there one day too &amp; found the choice and quality to be excellent!Location of the Hotel is fine. Walked to a couple of restaurants from there, which took about 15/20 mins. More on offer further a-field, but those trips would require taxis. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"Distant from city in Pudong area but comfortable expat community area Stayed here on business trip for 6 months, with my small family of 2. The establishment offers service apartments (back of building) and hotel rooms (front).Check-in was a breeze, some of the front desk staff are good english speaking, while others are a challenge. We stayed in few units throughtout, varying in layout and size. But overall, the size is good enough for a small family starting from 60 sq/m price around USD2000 per month. Kitchen is open concept for 1 or 2 bedroom units. Broadband is free (generally free and easily available in China) and everything else is complete and clean.From the airport, this is about 30 mins drive, as both are in the same new territory of Shanghai ie. Pudong. The city is another 30 mins or so, in the older territory ie. Puxi. There is no train station nearby ie. closest would be at science center about 10 mins drive.Surrounding area is basically an expat community. Mostly are people who wants to escape from the old bustling traffic congestion of Puxi or are working in the new territory (down the road 15 mins walk, there are many factories and industrial parks) or have children studying nearby (plenty of private schools). A walk of 15 mins (opposite end of industrial parks) would reach a shopping center with Carrefour, hair salons, fast foods, food courts, specialty grocery store, spa, fitness club, huge sports shopping franchise (Decathlon), hardware megastore, more more pub/restaurants (japanese, american, italian, vietnamese, of course chinese, etc.). Amenities are aplenty. The weekends would have families hanging out in this very area, next to a park, while sipping Starbucks coffee and dogs running around, football games, rolling on the grass, etc..... bazaars and fairs going on.If tired of nearby surroundings, a short cab ride around Pudong would take no longer than 15 mins to reach huge Pudong parks and other shopping areas (Thumb plaza) or Times Square Pudong or Pearl Tower, etc..In short, this area is superb for families. But for young couples looking for action, better to look somewhere in Puxi. "
ramada plaza pudong ,"nice but far from downtown I accompanied my husband to Shanghai on business. While he worked, I spent my days shopping, sightseeing and spa-ing. This is a very nice hotel - good service, good food, clean and comfortable rooms. It is perfect for the business traveller, but quite a trek for a vacationer to commute to the other side of the river where almost all good shopping and sightseeing is located. Your best bet is to take a taxi to the nearest subway station (costs under 20 RMB in August 2004) then take the subway across the river - much faster than by taxi the whole way because traffic is almost always busy in Shanghai. "
ramada plaza pudong ,Ramada plaza: een unieke ervaring 
ramada plaza pudong ,Perfetto prima di partire 
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Good place for an overnight airport stay I stayed here for a single night, after arriving from a long flight from Newark, and before traveling on to Nanjing, China. The Ramada was easy to get to, with convenient free shuttle service to and from the airport. The room was large and clean, with a nice enclosed balcony area. I had a reasonably priced Chinese dinner in one of the hotel restaurants, the Brasserie, and had a good night's rest with almost no airplane noise.My journey the next morning to Nanjing was quite interesting, as I took the Maglev train into the city, then two subway rides to the Main Rail station, where I was able to catch one of EIGHTY bullet trains which run between Shanghai and Nanjing EACH DAY. Crowding on the subway was quite excessive, even on a Saturday morning. Pollution was not bad in Shanghai, but terrible in Nanjing. People everywhere were quite friendly...not a trace of anti-American feeling.I would gladly stay at the Ramada Pudong Hotel on a future trip. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"good hotel Good standard, good western options on beer and foodas with all hotels in china, restaurant service is hopeless.. but you get used to it. best of the bunch.... "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,Okay for one night before flying The Ramada hotel at Pudong airport is your average airport hotel and fine for a nights stay before flying out. Rooms are ok with everything you need but the bathrooms werea little cramped. All services were fine and i would use the hotel again if flying out of Shanghai Pudong. Free shuttle bus to and from the airport 
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Good Hotel I stayed in this property for two weeks and was a bit concerned when I read the prior reviews from other fellow trip advisors. The hotel was booked by my work so I really did not have a choice. The room I stayed in was clean and room service was very good. I worked long hours during my stay and the house keeping would always leave a small snickers bar on my bed when I return at night. I thought that was quite nice.The staff at check in was efficient but I have to say their concierge was very average. I called them late at night once to organise a wake up call for the next morning as I had meetings to attend to. I never got my wake up call. When I questioned them they brushed me off and no one seemed to want to take responsibility. My room package also came with complimentary buffet breakfast every morning. The breakfast was crap. Everyday was the same food and the quality was very average. The location of the airport is good if you want a hotel to stay overnight. But its not very centralised. But you can always catch the hotel shuttle bus to the airport and connect to the Maglev to the Long Yang station and then transfer to the metroline if you want to go to Puxi.Finally, one thing I didn't like about this hotel was they only offered free wireless in the lobby. When I stayed at the Ramada in Doha they provided free wireless in the rooms. I thought being a Ramada brand all the hotels will have the same service.Overall a great hotel if you have to overnight in Shanghai and catch a plane the next morning. I would not recommend this hotel if you have business in Puxi or Pudong. They are far better located hotels over in the Pudong and Puxi city centre. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,Pathetic service We have never in our life experienced such bad service. Rude and completely unwilling to help!!! 
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Convenient airport hotel I stayed at the Putong Ramada last week when I arrived at Shanghai late at night. The hotel is literally next to the aiport, so it's very convenient if you flew in late or you're here for a stopover. Even though it's right by the airport, I barely heard any plane noise.The rooms are adequate for a one night stay. I had the late night snack at the hotel restaurant. It included fresh fruit and a bowl of wonton soup. The wonton soup was ok, but the shrimp in the soup didn't taste fresh, so I didn't eat them.I would recommend this hotel if you just need somewhere to sleep for one night near the airport. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"convenient for stopover The hotel is next to Shanghai airport. There is a hotel shuttle bus at the terminal exit and the journey will take you less than 5 minutes. Check in is fast, staff helpful, English is OK. Room and toilet are clean. Even though hotel is next to airport it is quiet. Shanghai is more than 1 hour by taxi or bus, best if you can take the 400 plus km/hr Maglev train. It will reach Shanghai in minutes. The hotel shuttle can talk you back to the airport, then its a short walk to the Maglev station. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Old tired and noisy Stayed here one night before flying out of PVG the next day. On arrival at the hotel the staff stood about for 5 minutes looking at us and our luggage before our interpreter shouted at them to get a porter - the first time that had happened in China so far.Rooms are old fashioned with old TV and small bathroom with no separate shower. Considering how new the airport looks, this hotel looks like it was here a good 20 years before the airport was built.Internet is available for 2 RMB per minute with a max charge per 24 hours of 100 RMB.Don't believe the website when it says that the rooms are soundproofed, I heard every takeoff and landing overnight.I'm sure the other airport hotels are worse, this is China, after all, but the Ramada group should be ashamed of themselves. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"sleep on the street rather than here Okay nobody is at their best at 2 am but that's the deal on the night desk. We arrived into Pudong from Sanya and had just ten hours before our outward flight. The woman at the desk at the Ramada was possibly the rudest person I've ever come across in the 'service' industry - after our taxi driver from the airport. We'd been in China for three weeks already and had loved it - same as anywhere, some great bits some crap - but avoid the Ramada if you can help it. And if you must stay there, don't open the wine -it's awful, corked and they'll try to make you pay. And go to plumbing school before you stay there. Cisterns are a disaster. Horrible end to a great trip. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Convenient hotel for a stop-over in Shanghai Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel (executive room)-efficient executive check-in is on the 7th floor with breakfast served from 6am. Hotel is a 5 minute shuttle bus ride from the airport terminal. Hotel shuttle is parked at bay #9 or #10 with a 30 minute frequency. The bay was not clearly marked and is located between the airport terminal and car park. Room is clean and has a small bathroom relative to the suite. Room amenities include a microwave, small refrigerator and LAN internet access. 40 minute taxi ride to Xin Tian Di is 140 to 150Y. Be aware that taxi fares increases after 10:30pm.This trip was part of our Tibet/Nepal trip. The Tibet itinerary was booked with Access Tibet Tour agency (highly recommended). Communications with ATT (Brian Yang) were timely and the trip went according to the itinerary. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Great for a stop-over Stayed at this hotel whilst stopping-over in Shanghai and found the free airport pick-up / drop-off to be quick and convenient.The hotel itself was well presented with good service and facilities. The Brasserie restaurants buffet menus provided a wide range of dishes, with unlimited supplies. Whilst the Chinese restaurant provided authentic dishes at a reasonable price.Our standard double room was clean, tidy and comfortable, and had a good shower for blasting off the jet-lag.Using the free airport shuttle bus in combination with the Maglev train provided a convenient means for getting in to the city centre. After exploring Shanghai's hectic streets, it was nice to head back out to the relative tranquility of the airport.Overall - a good hotel for Shanghai stop-overs. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Beware of a few things Airport hotels should be flexible with their check in times due to the very different arrival times of their guests. I heard that this property are really bad at this so emailed them the night before to say I would be in at 0800. I got to them at 0800 and no room was available. They told me I would have to wait almost 2 hours to get a room. NO WAY! I was tired and needed sleep so badly it was not funny. I spoke to the Duty Manager who sent me off to the cafe while the room was cleaned. Over an hour later I was in my room. Bad start! The room was ok actually - has a weird balcony which is enclosed. Then again, probably sensible with the toxic air around here. The rooms are quite comfortable and very well cleaned. Housekeepers do the best job in the entire property. The telephone staff leave a lot to be desired. Room service guy takes for ever to deal with and their room service menu is quite limited. I am not a fan of the food here despite being an adventurous eater. Regardless, prices are good I guess. I am here on business so would never choose to come back. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,Very good Very pleasant stay at this hotel. Excellent for the airport - only 5 minutes by shuttle bus and also takes you to the Maglev station (in the airport) which then takes only 8 minutes to get to the new exhibition area. Food in the restaurant was good although the breakfast buffet could have been a bit hotter. Overall a good experience and would stay again. 
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Dated tired hotel with building works We only stayed here overnight before our flight back to the uk. From the reviews i was expecting a nice relaxing room. However when we arrived i noticed building works. Half the hotel was being refurbished, there was no mention of this when i booked through the website. We went to check in. I had requested a double room ,now beware a double room in China means a twin room. So thats what we got. I went down to complain but they said they upgraded us to an deluxe room and as half the building was out they only had twin rooms available. Well the room wasn't very nice at all, i dread to think what a standard room was like. It was dated, not very clean and the beds were hard as nails. Needless to say we didn't sleep a wink. It looks like they are updating all the hotel rooms, i would not recommend a stay in this hotel until this has been completed.Unfortunately this is the only hotel 2 mins from the airport and is just about bearable if you are only staying for an overnight stay. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Ideal stop over hotel. Ideal for a stop over for connecting flights the next day. It was a right decision to stay over and get rested after a long overseas flight rather than making a conncection at the Hongqiao airport which is almost an hour away in the evening . The hotel shuttle bus pick up location is across from Exit 9 / 10 with the hotel name clearly marked on a concrete piller above the eye level. It is a smaller size (Perhaps 16 passangers) bus and it runs every 30 minutes which starts very early in the morning. The bus is also clearly marked with the hotel name. Be careful when loading as the bus was loading on the traffic side of the lane and we have also observed airport maintenance vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. When we arrived at the arrival level , there is a larger hotel bus waiting at the same location but we were told that it was waiting for the airline crews. The driver of the big bus kindly was very helpful and directed us to the proper waiting area. Hotel check-in , bell and restaurant services were great and English was spoken throughout the hotel. The hotel lobby is grand considering it is a stop-over hotel. Rooms are relatively small but is contemporary, clean and efficient and for the price that we were paying, it is a very good value. One of the TV channels provided up-to date flight departure information which comes in handy for the reson why people are staying at the hotel. We ate at the hotel's Chinese restaurant at the balcony level and the food was delicious, especailly the Chinese style steak. There were complimentry breakfast buffet provided at the Western food restaurant on the main level which we did not expect as those buffet could run up to $20 per person. For the room rate of $100 per night for 2 it is a real bargain and the quality of food was reasonable. The airport is undergoing a major expansion which may consider a hotel annex to the terminals similar to that in Vanocuver, Orlando or Hong Kong without the use of shuttles, Until then the Ramada Pudong is an ideal choice after a long filght. It is a upscale Ramada. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"Best choice at PuDong Airport The Ramada is situated at Pudong airport so it is a good choice for a late arrival or early morning departure. There is a shuttle bus that runs between the hotel and the airport every 30 minutes. This departs from the airport opposite Exit No. 9 or 10. Be aware that if you get a taxi most drivers do not understand English. Taxi or bus takes about 5 minutes between the two sites.Check in and out is straight forward. The staff are reasonably friendly and speak good English. Rooms are clean and comfortable, some are a bit small. Biggest problem with the rooms is the noise, if you get a room facing the airport there is noise from both the planes and also the road. This is fine if you have an early flight but if you arrived late don't expect to lie in....Food is okay, the Chinese restaurant has a varied menu and the staff are generally very attentive. Check out the basement bar, drinks are quite expensive and it is often very quiet but when you get the right crowd in here it's a scream. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"nice for a stopover Conveniently located for the airport and the magnetic levitation train...but far from everywhere else. If you go into town ensure that the taxi doesn't go to the airport -and have to add ten minutes onto your journey -but takes the slip road just before the hotel - get the concierge to write it in chinese on the little map on the back of the hotel card. This is a good hotel for a stopover and you can just make it into town for a quick morning on the levitation train and metro, and its an exciting way to see shanghai if you don't have any time.The rooms were a good size -beds slightly on the hard side, but after a long long flight you'll sleep. Staff very friendly and attentive without being in your face. Good value if you have to be near the airport or you have a stopover, probably better to stay in town tho' if you are staying more than one night. "
ramada pudong airport hotel ,"comfort I had the opportunity to stay at the Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel twice over the past two weeks. It's located immediatly adjacent to the airport property, about a 3 minute shuttle bus drive from the terminal. Based upon my experiences on previous visits to Shanghai, the closest acceptable &quot;western style&quot; hotels require at least a 45 minute drive from the airport, so this was a real treat after an 18 hour trip from the US. The executive level floor rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The executive lounge offers free beverages and snacks, and the hotel features two full service restaurants. AT US$95.00/night, including a full breakfast bufet, this hotel is also a very good value. "

ramada zhabei ,"Comfortable and convenient We found this hotel to be clean, well-equipped and convenient. We booked a standard room, which was comfortably big enough for our young family of 3. The hotel was only 10 minutes walk to the subway station, from there we could get to the city in no time. For those time when we didn't feel like eating outside, there was a good Cantonese restaurant in the same building. The hotel had a money changer offering decent conversion rates, a real time saver because there were not many money changers in the city. In-room Internet wasn't free but was cheap and fast enough (make sure to ring the lobby to activate it). Overall very good for a 3-star hotel. "
ramada zhabei ,Reasonable 4 star hotel You might end up here if you book with Wendy Wu 3 star tour. If so this will be one of the better hotels that you will stay at and certainly good enough. Only the bathroom is a bit of a let down with the odd bit of mould but this does not mean that the rooms or bathroom are dirty. Food is okay. Generally a good experience. 
ramada zhabei ,"Very good hotel in a gritty location Stayed her as part of a tour. was our first stop in China. Rooms comfortable, nice staff, beds firm but OK, Sensational Breakfast (mixed Eastern and Western). Just a bit far out of town, but otherwise good. Was nicest hotel we stayed in in China "
ramada zhabei ,"Enoyed The Ramada I started my trip to China in Shanghai, taking a 20 hour train journey from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Ramada is only a 10 minute taxi ride from the Railway Station - can't be walked as too many flyovers between the Station and the Hotel. It is not in the tourist part of town but has a decent coffee shop and although it does have Internet facilities available on site, these are expensive but 2 minutes along the road is a huge Internet ccafe (for want of a better word) where there is good, fast, cheap acccess. Lots of little supermarket shops around, plus a market and a small park where you can join in with the Tai Chi in the mornings when the locals bring their caged birds out to hang in the trees and get fresh air.After my other two stops at hotels in Xian and Beijing, this hotel was definitely the best and the staff were generally very helpful. "
ramada zhabei ,"Good hotel but somewhat remote from the main Shanghai sites Stayed at this hotel as part of a Wendy Wu Tour. It is now under the Ramada brand. Hotel is a good 3 star. Rooms are of a good size and have a typical hotel layout. They are clean and comfortable, bathroom in good condition - I even had a bath!! Complimentary water in room. Breakfast was included and was good, a selection of both western and chinese food. The only fault with this hotel is that it is quite remote from the main sites of Shanghai. However, the subway is within walking distance and taxis are very cheap. If you go out of the hotel lobby and turn left you will come to a small park where locals practice tai chi in the mornings and gather to dance in the evenings. Also men come to show off their caged songbirds. If you go out of the hotel and turn right there is a little supermarket selling lemonade, wine and snacks. Also if you keep on walking and turn left and follow the block you get a sample of the lifestyle of the locals. It is very safe area. If I were to stay in Shanghai again I would probably choose a more central hotel. "
ramada zhabei ,"Small but OK My wife and I were on a package tour of China as part of a Wendy Wu Tours &quot;China Experience&quot; tour staying at Shanghai, Xian and Beijing.The first port of call was Shanghai where we stayed at the Ramada CCECC Hotel Zhabei. For a communist country this hotel ws not too bad however, if you are expecting 5 Star luxury then forget it. It is classed as a 4 Star Hotel but this must mean by China standards but even so was still a pleasant place to stay.Breakfast was OK with a variety of Western and Asian food to satisfy most tastes and the rooms were cleaned daily to higher than expected standards. The only fault that we could find was that the standard room only had a double bed which was very hard but bearable.Staff treated us very well and nothing was too much for them to handle with the majority of them being able to converse in English.A reasonably priced hotel within striking distance of the major tourist venues and nearby to a small park that has a variety of locals doing their morning Tai Chi etc. "
ramada zhabei ,"My nicest stay at Shanghai This is my second time staying at this Hotel in Shanghai. I loved the place so much I stayed twice! The rooms are in good size with all you can wish for including a minibar, cable TV, tea tray, etc. The bathrooms are great, in excellent condition, clean and good size. The shower is powerful and the tub is clean.The CCECC hotel, also called ZhongTu, has 4 lifts so you wont have any trouble regarding the floor you stay on. The reception is big and the staff speak good english. No communication problems whatsoever.This hotel is conviniently located close to the railway station but far enough (5mins) as to stay away from pickpockets (always mind your wallet in Shanghai though). Closest subway station is 5mis walk from the hotel and taxis to major atractions are cheap cheap cheap. Advice: do not stay at hotels way too close to the railway station! Difficult to get a taxi and the are is full of pickpockets!The laundry service was excellent, cheap and fast. Well done guys.My wife and I had a lovely stay at this hotel and I'm sure I will be back for the 3rd time! Until then: Zai jian! "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Worst service and hotel in recent memory. I booked a regular room at first and it was the smallest room I have ever seen. I was there only 2 nights so I let it go then I was taking a shower and the water suddenly went icy cold and it was winter in Shanghai. Fortunately, I was almost done with my shower or I would have frozen in the shower. I called the desk and there was no apology. I requested a transfer to the suite and paid double the price with no discount. The room was spacious but then the internet was not working - again no apology or discount and insisted that there was something wrong with my notebook. I could not accept it as it was working just a while ago in the small room I transferred from. Then I wanted to cook some food and I was told that I have to pay 10 yuan for each utensil. I would not stay again at this hotel even if it is free. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Best Value for Money If you dont need any frills - just stay here. They give you a nice comfortable rooms, I got one at the 26th floor - the view was amazing with nice cool breeze. The rooms a bit small but very comfortable and clean - what more can you ask for USD 30. Just carry the map of the location along with you, as not many Taxi drivers know the location of Service apartments. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Great value for Families I stayed there in one of their 3-bedroom apartments at the end of November with my family of 5 (all adults) for 3 nights. The apartment was spacious and had a large living and dining area. The apartment is very modernly design and of a high quality for what we were expecting from the price we paid.The few issues we had were the front desk which I found the staff to be rude and unhelpful (even the bell boy was more friendly and helpful!). Also, whilst the apartment was fully furnished, the kitchen was completely empty of any utensils and the washing machine in the laundry had no water pipe installed which needed a call to maintenance to fix. Although the location was not close to places of interest, considering the price and quality it was worth staying at Rayfont (since price of taxi's is fairly cheap in Shanghai).Since we were traveling in a group of 5, Rayfont was the best choice we could find. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"not too bad for your money Not too expensive , stayed 4 nights in small basic room approx 450 rmb Quite modern and clean. But romm was very small and almost no desk for computer. Then changed room for one bedroom apartment type with kitchenette and living room. Much more spacious but almost twice the rate .Restaurant breakfast is OK but nothing more (half chinese half western style)Staff was quite professionnal but need to repeat many time coz their english is.... SO SO At the end that was OKHotel location is ..... so so Not in a busy district so you have to walk at leat 15 minutes ( or taxi ) to find shops and restaurants.At the end , that was not too bad . I would return for short stay but as a second choice only . I would try another place . Nothing really amazing from this place except low prices from basic rooms.... "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Okie for a Short trip We stayed in a 2-bedroom Apartment in Block B on the 26th floor for 5 nights. Rooms are neat and clean and there's nothing much to complain about it. Breakfast is not good so we decided to go out and have breakfast instead.One thing about the staff, they do not speak much English but fortunately we were able to speak mandarin to them. We asked one the the staff regarding shopping areas in Shanghai and he recommended me a street full of shops. (That was around 6 in the evening). So I hailed a taxi to proceed there. I was shocked that all the stores were closed. He didn't inform me that the shops were closed by then. In the end, I had to take a taxi to another shopping area.If you are just staying without using the facilities then its fine. I went to the pool on the 3rd day of my stay and found it weird because a swimming cap is needed before going to the pool and you gotta purchase it from them if you don't have it. It was an &quot;indoor&quot; swimming pool, Why i say &quot;indoor&quot; is because previously it was raining and there were droplets of water dripping from the &quot;indoor&quot; pool glass ceiling. Maintenance of the pool area was kind of poor.I would probably think twice of staying there again for that amount I paid for. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Great if you have a lot of patience and can tolerate incompetence. FACTS. I reserved my hotel room through www.hotels.com for $59.00/night. I stayed there for 18 days during the '08 Olympics. . If you don't smoke, make sure you stress to the travel agent or online booking company that you want a non-smoking room. Those rooms are located on the first eight floors of the building. In other words, don't expect a non-smoking room on the high stories. . I made sure that I called the hotel a few days before my arrival to confirm my reservation. Always do that. Luckily, they did have my reservation though language was a barrier. The hotel telephone number is [-].. Once you arrive at PVG airport and get your luggage, exchange $500 to RMBs/Yuans at the bank kiosk located in the baggage claim area. At the time, the rate was $1.00 = 6.74 RMBs/Yuans (pronounced Kwan). Warning, do not trust the exchange bank tellers as they slipped with the 100 RMB/Yuan notes two fake 100 bills. As the saying goes, you only know what you know. I discovered a couple days later when no one would accept my two 100 bills that they were fake, in fact they were color copies, SOB! Taxi drivers gave me the &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; look. It was embarrassing. I ended up shredding and throwing them away. Learn this -- most fake bills are 20 RMBs/Yuans. 100s are rare but I was the unfortunate one. Check every single 20 and 100 RMBs/Yuans bill even if you get change from a bank teller, a hotel front desk employee, a store clerk, a restaurant, or even a taxi driver rushing to give you your change back in rush hour traffic. Stop and take your time checking every single 20 and 100 bill. You do that by scratching your fingernail against the neck or hat of General Mao Tse-Tung. If you don't feel crevices then it's likely a fake. Don't worry if you get rushed or clerks laugh at you trying to be smart for checking for fake bills. Do it if you don't find your money hanging on trees. I learned my lesson the hard way and ended up catching a few fakes a few days in Shanghai.. The hotel was an hour drive from PVG airport. Cost me approximately, 100 RMBs/Yuans, which is not bad at all. Make sure you print a copy off the Internet of the hotel address in Chinese for the taxi driver or better yet, print the attached scanned card and show it to the Taxi driver. Most drive very fast. Close your eyes and think happy thoughts. No tipping in China. The hotel was formerly known as Rayfont Celebrity Service Hotel and Apartments. It is located at 1077 Xie Tu Road (pronounced Che Two Lu) and its intersection with Ruijin Road (pronounced Roohen Lu), Lu meaning Road. . At check in time, the front desk will run a debit for 1000 RMBs/Yuans deposit which they are supposed to return to you if their has been no damage to the room.. The single room reminds me a bit of a room at the W Hotels in the States -- dark brown somewhat contemporary furniture. The room had a Queen-size bed with a nice large leather headboard, like in most hotels in China, the mattress had no padding, in other word, it felt like sleeping on a hard surface, which did not bother me since it is better for my back; however, the majority of Westerners will find it extremely uncomfortable. The room also included a desk, a chair, two end tables, one table lamp, a dresser, a decent-size closet, a small combination safe, and an analog television with 60 some channels including English language American channels. The room looked exactly like the panoramic picture advertised on the website; however, the room is not as big as it appears in the picture. After all, it is a panoramic picture so it makes the room look larger. The size of the bedroom was 10ft x 12ft including the furniture. There was 3ft clearance all around the bed.. My room was very clean and was odorless.. The AC in the room worked great. You can freeze in your room when the outside temperature in August reaches 95 degrees.. You can get Internet service in your room via an Ethernet cable for about 40 RMBs/Yuans or $5.00/day. Instead, I wirelessly and freely joined an unlocked Linksys Network by placing my laptop computer close to the sliding door at the end of the bed. Sometimes the connection was weak but it was enough to check my e-mails until I made it to a coffee shop or restaurant where usually free wireless Internet service is available. . The bathroom looked like the picture advertised on the website as well. Stand up shower, commode, a faucet to wash feet, plenty of cabinet space, heated lamps for the winter, plenty of clean towels, combs, tooth paste, tooth brush, hair cap, soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. . Housekeeping did a great job. A team of two girls usually knocks on your door between 9:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. They are very sweet, polite and humble. They don't speak English. Expect a knock on the door even if you clearly place the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign outside on the door handle. They did every single day regardless -- just accept it. They are not stupid -- they're just trying to do their job. They seemed honest, nothing was taken from my room, not my MacBook Pro, not my iPod, not my camera, not my PDA, not my souvenirs -- nothing. They replace your sheets every third day in an effort to conserve water (Kudos); however, they did replace my towels every single day I asked to, mopped the bedroom/bathroom/balcony floors, and wiped the dust. No tipping in China.. Although the floors are concrete, one can easily hear guests in the floor above walking or their bed frame banging against the headboard or floor whenever they are getting it on. That is expected because construction quality in China is not up to par.. I was not able to hear traffic or construction noise during my 18-day stay at the hotel -- of course the sliding door to the balcony was always closed. By the way, make sure that door is in the lock position because the balcony has a fire exit door leading to a stairwell.. I never felt unsafe anytime during my stay at the hotel even when I returned after midnight; however, I brought to the attention of the assistant manager the fact that their is not security guard who checks access keys or whether a guest is staying at the hotel before letting the person walk through the lobby and catch the elevator up. He was sincere and showed interest in what I was trying to make him aware of. He assured me that the hotel has a security guard. What he was referring to was a young guy who waits outside the hotel door holding a Walkie-Talkie. He usually opens the passenger door whenever a taxi pulls up to the hotel entrance. Not once did any of the guys who work the third shift ask me for credentials, which is a standard practice in most hotels around the world. After all, anyone would have not problem walking into the hotel late at night, taking the elevator up to a room and breaking in.. The assistant manager at the hotel was William Yuan. Very nice, professional, soft-spoken, young fella. He spoke English very well and was eager to assist me. I was very impressed with his outstanding customer service and managerial skills.. Although there is a restaurant in the hotel, I did not eat there because I was told that it is not that good. I can't say for sure.. Be aware that sending your dirty clothes to be laundered at the hotel can be very expensive. For example, to wash each plain white undershirt, T-shirt, underwear, etc. will cost you $20 RMBs/Yuans = $3.00. Each shorts will cost you 25 RMBs/Yuans = $4.00. Your best bet if you need to wash your clothes is to get out of the hotel, make a right on Xie Tu Road, walk to the next street, make a right, walk to the apartment building behind the hotel and you will find a public Laundromat. Make sure you check their price sheet. . One Wednesday midnight on my way back to the hotel, the taxi passed by a Karaoke club on Xie Tu Road approximately 300 yards across from the hotel. There were lots of attractive women and I mean really, really attractive girls existing the club. The taxi pulled up to the hotel entrance. It was a little after midnight. In the hotel lobby I counted six girls sitting on the couches and two standing talking to one another. First thing that came to mind was: &quot;Holy Toledo, there must have been a fashion show at the hotel while I was out wasting my time at Starbucks and Costa Coffee Shop.&quot; The women I saw in the hotel lobby that night were b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l. Not your average, 5'10&quot; Shanghainese, long black hair, pretty girls. These girls looked like models - no kidding. I have traveled to many places in this world like Russia, Ukraine, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, Denmark, Japan, you name it but these were different. They looked like models. They were not vulgar. They did not speak to anyone. They were not sleazy looking. The scene looked like an after-fashion show function. The concierge, who was trying to keep his eyes open because in China employees work 12-hour shifts, did not pay attention to the girls. They all were minding their business. I asked him whether I had missed a fashion show. He explained that they were working girls that just left the Karaoke club down the street and came to the hotel to earn some money in return for services should a single/lonely guest shows interest. He added that they are professionals and charge 120 RMBs/Yuans = $18. He also mentioned that the working girls have clearance from the hotel and are tested. I asked him whether the sight of working girls in the lobby offends guests. He replied that they are low key despite their beauty. That they know exactly who is single and is staying alone at the hotel and who is not. Folks, I learned later that this is typical in all hotels in China even at the most luxurious hotels at the &quot;Bund&quot; that many tourists refer to and recommend in their reviews. Again, this is typical in all hotels there. Since this is not my cup of tea, I ended up going up to my room by myself and slept face down. :-)WHAT I WISH WAS DIFFERENT - Let me begin by saying that no one in China is obligated to cater to those of us whose native language is English and I respect that; however, at this hotel and elsewhere in China there was the language barrier. Most front desk employees and concierges speak and understand a little English. Let me stress the word little. In rare cases, I was able to find a concierge who spoke and understood English well. I was blessed with one concierge at this hotel who understood me and was very helpful in recommending places to dine, professional /well-reputable massage parlors, wrote directions in Chinese to give to the taxi drivers, etc.. The most irritating and frustrating things that left a really bad taste in my mouth were:(i) Receiving calls in my room. Almost every time my girlfriend called the hotel, gave them my room number, my last name, and asked to be transferred, the front desk operator(s) acted clueless and failed to transfer the call. She called me every morning during the 18 days I stayed at this hotel and went through the teeth pulling process to reach me. Even my Chinese buddy who lived in Shanghai and spoke perfect Mandarin Chinese became very frustrated with repeated incidents of stupidity and incompetence of the front desk operator(s). They hang up the phone on him a few times. No kidding. (ii) The incompetence of the front desk/reservation again due to the language barrier and not taking initiative. Say you want to check out two days before your scheduled date. So you call Hotels.com to inform them you will be leaving earlier than scheduled. You go downstairs and inform (clearly and slowly) the front desk staff of your plans. You ask them to document in their system that the guest in room # .…. will be checking out two days earlier. The front desk staff assures you that they noted it in their system. You stop by the next day just to be 100% sure but this time around the staff at the front desk are not aware of what your plans are and cannot find any notes! So you inform them again (clearly and slowly) of your plans. On your checkout day, you have a final walk through with housekeeping to confirm that there has been no damage to the room and nothing is missing. You request from the housekeeping girls to call the front desk and inform them that everything is okay. They do make the call while you are standing there. You go downstairs to check out and they are really quick to check you out. You ask them for the 1000 RMBs/Yuans deposit back but they say they cannot do that yet until they check that there has been no damage to the room! Fifteen minutes wasted while the taxi is waiting at the entrance and you are running late to the airport. You have them call housekeeping again to confirm. They do and finally return the deposit. You ask them regarding the refund of the two nights you will not be staying there. They reply that Hotels.com will have to call them to confirm that you checked out earlier than planned. On your way to the airport you call Hotels.com. They call the hotel and confirm that you left. You are expecting a refund to your credit card, right? Guess what – 30 days pass and no refund! You call Hotels.com and they call the hotel to confirm but the front desk is unable to find the reservation in their system so the person on the phone “passes the buck” and ask the Hotels.com representative to call the next day to speak to someone else. Welcome to China folks – ask a simple question and more than likely you will end up getting passed to five different individuals before your question is answered. I guess they just shy away whenever there is a language issue. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"A good hotel with a slightly out-of-the-way location Having booked the Rayfont on Hotels.com for a rate of less than GBP £30 a night I wasn't expecting great things. I was pleasantly surprised. The inside of the hotel is attractive and my double room was well-presented, with wood effect flooring, lots of storage and a balcony. The bathroom was beautifully appointed and very spacious. My room and the hotel as a whole were clean and seemed to be well-maintained. There is a good pool which is free to guests, and which the receptionist made a point of mentioning at check-in. The hotel restaurant on the first floor was attractively decorated and, apart from breakfast, suprisingly reasonably priced. Staff were friendly and the concierge was particularly helpful in translating destinations into Chinese characters for taxi drivers and arranging taxis. The downside of this hotel was the location - there is no metro station nearby and it took twenty to thirty minutes to reach places of interest in taxis; although these are cheap, the hassle and the cost could mount up if you like to come and go from your hotel during the day. I agree with the previous reviewer that it's extremely hard to find primary information on this hotel online. After a lot of searching, I stumbled across the hotel's website in English (http://www.longemonthotels.com/en/dyrf/). "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Rayfont - not a bad option Initially found this place on Expedia and wanted to find more info. But it'svery difficult hotel to locate this hotel on www. I eventually found their website but it was in Chinese only, with no rates or online booking, so pretty useless. Additionally, their business card states no web or email address.Location: South west Shanghai. Not usefully near a metro, unless you really want to walk for 15 mins in searing heat. Therefore, taxis everywhere. Average price was 25 rmb, average journey time was 20 mins or so. Depends on time of day, destination, of course. Getting a taxi home in the rush hour was a nightmare. 45-60 mins fom Pu Dong airport, 30-45 mins to Hong Qiao. Small metro next to the hotel, some restaurants within walking distance. Most taxi drivers didn't have a clue where to find it, so take a card from the hotel.Accomodation: we booked a &quot;luxury 3 bedroom deluxe suite&quot; at £79 per night (expedia). Initially booked for 2 nights in case we didn't like it. But we did like it and stayed for a further 5 nights. The apartment was spacious and well equipped, quite well maintained and modern with dark wood flooring throughout, comprising:1 king size bedroom with en-suite (the en-suite was a bit tired and had a shower over the bath). 2 further double bedrooms and a separate shower roomwhich was in good condition. Good size living room with 2 sofas, dining table and chairs, tv, cabinet, etc. Basic but comfortable and very welcoming.Fully equipped kitchen (glasses, cutlery, plates etc available on request) and washing room (with washing m/c). Huge balcony wrapping round the whole apartment. Dirty, unfortunately, as were all the windows.Internet was available at 3.6 rmb per day, plus .06 rmb per minute, or 300 rmb per month. Apartment was cleaned daily and the laundry service was effective if a bit expensive.Didn't bother with the restaurant, except for one late breakfast which was utterly pathetic. Pool looks good, and very big. There's a massage place in the basement. Staff were fine, although my wife is Chinese so I was spared the usual communication problems.Would I go again? If I needed to accomodate 3 or more people, or a family, definitely. If it was just two adults, I'd go for a better location. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Avoid if possible We were not at all impressed with this hotel. We had a two bedroom apartment, which consisted of 2 bedrooms with a small hall connecting them, along with a small closet and bathroom. First, the good: the room on the 23rd floor had a nice view of the courtyard, and was relatively noise free (from outside noises anyhow). There were TVs in both bedrooms which got a lot of channels (once we plugged in the coax cable, which was unplugged), including several English channels. Check-in and check-out were somewhat efficient, and at least they had our prepaid reservation (unlike the person behind us whose reservation they had lost). That's about the end of the good...The rooms reeked of smoke (we are non-smokers, but have stayed in smoking rooms many times without a problem, but the smell in these rooms was enough to make you sick). The beds were very hard with springs poking up at you, and the mattress sagged so you had a tendency to roll towards the middle. They required a 1000 CNY deposit, and had a long list of things they could charge you for &quot;damaging&quot;, even though the room was already in poor shape. There were 3 of us, and when we asked for a new towel, we were presented with a receipt showing a 90 CNY charge, which we eventually, after much struggle, figured out that was the charge for not returning the extra towel. The floors seemed very thin as we could hear people above us moving around, and to top our experience out, we had to kill several bugs (beetles?) in the bathroom. I would really recommend you spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere else. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Not for Celebrities.... Out of the centre of Shanghai just beside the french concession, the Celebrity is a typical asian serviced appartment that offers exactly what it advertises - great space for bargin $$$.The appartments are relatively easy to find for taxi drivers ,but bring the hotel card just in case - in the imediate locality there are lots of small shops to stock up on snacks and drinks for the appartment and some good bakeries for breakfast. If you enjoy walking, the ex-pat area, with all it's bars and restaurants, in the French Concession is a 15 minute walk throught the tree lined streets.The room (we had a delux suite) was large with seperate kitchen (with utensils) dining area sitting room and seperate bedroom. Comfy sofa (which opened out into a bed) and large tv lent to comfortable lounging space in the evenings. Good hard bed but basic bathroom (rubbish shower). Decor was excellent with good black out curtains to stop the early morning sun, but not the trafic noise!Staff were friendly and tried to help but had minimal english - matching our minimal mandarin! On arrival reception had no record of our booking - it transpired that they couldn't read the name on my passport properly, looking for a booking in the name of James (my middle name!!!!!)Didn't eat in the cafe: it looked ok though &amp; always seemed busy.The pool and spa area were basic but sufficient for a few laps to wake up in the morning.For the money Celebrity offers fantastic space for those travelling with children rather than being cooped up in Shanghai's small hotel rooms. Not central but within a taxi ride of anywhere!Recommended. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Too far out It smells. Shanghai smells, so does this hotel. It puts the Sh into Shanghai. But this city that's grown too fast didn't really advance plan the sewerage system, so perhaps this hotel is like others. The staff try their best. Their English levels really aren't that bad and they're eager to help. The rooms look good on the website but close up they are bony and uncomfortable. In their favour they're huge but just not inviting. The local area is rubbish. There is nothing to see or do, so you end up getting taxis in and out of the centre of town. Fortunately they're pretty cheap. If you've got the money, then stay in one of the super luxury hotels. If you haven't, then just don't bother with Shanghai. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"A reasonable hotel at a fair price Stayed in the family suite with 3 bedrooms and one big living room. It had a kitchen as well. Stayed there for 3 days and it was perfect for us. We stayed 6 people there, so instead of getting 3 rooms, we decided to try out the big suite. Worked out pretty well as there are 2 bathrooms with showers (one of them had a bathtub as well), a large kitchen and a large living room + the 3 bedrooms of course, so nobody got tired of sitting on each others laps. The living room was a natural meeting point and it had a large dining table and a coffee table, where we could all sit. A drawback is definitely the breakfast. Not that inspiring, but is was pretty cheap (20 RMB). There was a good little kiosk just next to the hotel where we bought some food instead. We had to pay extra for the plates, knives and forks as the kitchen was totally empty but even then we just gave up on making our own dinner and went out instead, so don't count on making 3 star Michelin dinner here. Would recommend the room for 3 couples like us. The service at the hotel was fair. The location was a little bit away from the center but pretty close to our Shanghai office though not walking distance. Next time I'll rather choose something closer to the city center and take a cab to the office... "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"A well run hotel I spent almost two weeks here over the special olympics, I chose it based on it's location, reviews and price and I certainly wasn't disappointed.Check in wasn't the best, the staff barely spoke any english but once we got over the formalities and were direct to our room our minds were put to ease. The rooms were in great condition and with excellent views across the city.The only down side to the hotel was the resturant wasn't the best, poor cloice of food and the back of the room needed to be painted. There was no prblem getting taxi's to and from the hotel. Also, it hasn't been mentioned before but the hotel actually has three ATM machines besides the lift, so no need to walk down the street to withdraw cash. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"A Well Kept Celebrity Secret Getting there: From Pudong Airport about 160 CYN. Best to have a map &amp; Chinese translation of the hotel on hand for the driver. Found one online which was a lifesaver. Keep in mind that most taxi drivers speak little to no English. Check in/Check out: There is a 1500 CYN guarantee charge by visa card on check in, but this is refunded on checking out. Had no problems with my credit card at all after that. Checking in and out was easy. There was an English speaking staff available to assist.Conceige Services: Provided a good map and helpful information. Luggage storage facilities available - in fact they held our bags for us for 2 days as we went to Hangzhou and didn't want to lug them along. Also helped us book tickets for Era - Intersection of Time, which was quite a distance away, had we wanted to get them ourselves. We had tried initially to book online before we arrived, but to no avail.Rooms: We booked the 2 bedrooms apartment - and we were thrilled. There were 2 bedrooms with double bed (a little hard, but I found that alright), telephones and television in each. In one of the rooms, there was a refrigerator and tea making facilities. Bedroom slippers were available and each room had its own airconditioning. Handy for those that like varying temperature and gets up at varying times! And all this for about €50, was simply unbelievable in Shanghai!!! There are 2 blocks - A,B and C,D. In the first part of our stay, we were in the C block which was better than the A block, which appeared holder and had a damp problem. We were quite high up, which was good as that meant no noise! Shanghai is a very busy city!!! Bathrooms were showers only - no tubs. There was a plumbing issue, which I think is rather common throughout the country. Easily remedied by a good ol'plunger which they were quick to sort out.Entertainment: Television were local channels. Hardly used any of the hotels facilities, although I am not sure what facilities they had. I think there was massage services and a coffee shop in house. They also had local English papers and magazines. Best to bring a novel.Location &amp; Local Amenities: SItuated about 15 minutes from a metro station - Da Ma Qiao, which was handy and efficient. Otherwise, hotel staff hails taxis for guests. Please be aware that there may be a queue in the morning for taxis. Taxis are cheap and safe. As Shanghai is so spread out, taxis are more or less an essential - but use the official taxi rank!!! Local Amenities include a supermarket about 5 minutes walk away - cash and local credit cards only. There are also bakeries and &quot;pao&quot; stalls (steamed chinese bun) and convenience stalls nearby. Silk King is at the Da Ma Qiao junction for those wanting to buy Silk. Overall, would stay here again. Good value, and convenient. But if you are looking for 5 star comfort, this isn't it! This is more of a local business/family hotel, where one is looking for a clean and decent accomodation as a base. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Neither heaven nor hell During our 11-night stay at the Celebrity we experienced just about everything the prior reviewers noted with the exception of the location. It is not within walking distance of any tourist attractions, especially in hot August. The property is relatively new, but already showing some signs of age and deferred maintenance. I saw the plunger outside my front door, and was prepared for the worst, but we did not need to use it. The cleanliness was ok. The damp mopping was merely spreading around soil, as I wiped up spills on my kitchen floor and the paper towel came up with a black film. Ok, here are the details. The front desk and staff ranged from smiling to dismissive. Rarely were they truly helpful. They clearly suffered from what ails many Chinese hotels. The public contact staff were process oriented and not customer oriented. Being forewarned by previous reviews, we inspected our refrigerator as soon as we entered the room and found it plugged in, turned on and room temperature inside. We asked to be relocated immediately.Our deluxe suite was on special on Travelocity, a great deal. This hotel does rate a high value, as you get to prepare your own western breakfast with range, coffee maker, and hot water pot. For 50 Yuan you can rent basic tableware and cookware. It's a good deal for longer stays, allowing spoiled westerners to enjoy their eggs their style and cold breakfast cereals just like home. A Century Mart is about four blocks east and has a good selection of groceries, fruits and vegetables. The convenience store is two doors west.The deluxe rooms are comfortable with nice sofa and side chair, living room table, TVs in both bed and living rooms, and a dining room table and four chairs. The beds are reasonably soft considering it is China. By western standards they are very firm, much better than rock hard common in China. Sheets are changed every few days, but they will change daily on request. The maids tried hard. The problem with damp mopping without frequent rinses in clean water is a training issue. Another long-term occupant with different maids complained to me in the elevator and with the assistant manager in the lobby about lack of cleanliness in his unit.The restaurant has a reasonably priced limited breakfast buffet. After one try, we opted for cooking/preparing our own. The location is south of downtown, from 15 to 25 yuan by taxi from most tourist attractions. Taxis are cheap, but daytime gridlock make them problematical sometimes. The doormen were very efficient in obtaining taxis from the street.The internet service worked as advertised. The plug converter, extra pillows and extra towels all required a signed receipt, promising to pay for them if they were missing upon checkout. The south view from the high floors takes in the Huangpu River, and the site of the 2010 World Expo along the river.If mediocre is good enough and you are value driven, the Celebrity will be a decent choice. The longer term reservation specials price this property in the bargain range per square foot for a three-star property. The two and three bedroom units are certainly a draw for a family or small group of friends. If you require more attentive service and/or require some pampering, you will not be happy at the Celebrity. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Underwhelmed We stayed here largely due to positive reviews which we now find puzzling. Indeed this is a new hotel but we experienced a number of basic failures. Plumbing was poor - housekeeping plunged the toilet more than once, though there was little more than paper to confront. The refrigerator was slightly cooler than room temperature, a fact we discovered after our chicken salad sandwiches had spoiled. The manager had to splice wires to get our Internet connected. Service was somewhere between lax and arrogant. Upon requesting a late checkout, the Assistant Manager told us (very belatedly), &quot;Ha ha, no, you see... this is Shanghai. We don't do that here.&quot; We've stayed in ten or so diverse hotels in Shanghai; there are many fine options out there at reasonable prices. The old adage still rings true: you usually get what you pay for. "

rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Great Value for Money I stayed here with my brother and his friends last March and I its a good place to stay when you are running on a tight budget. Unlike the previous hotel I stayed in, in Shanghai last December, this is more standard stuff. No down pillows or L'occitane toiletries. But lets just say adequate. The room was okay, we got a two bedroom unit, though the beds were small and we had to share beds, it was okay...its not like it was cramped. The problem was there was only 1 bathroom so mornings were hell.The staff can't speak much english so it helps if you can speak mandarin. there is a bank next door if you need money and a convenience store next to it...so you can buy supplies. Anyway its a good hotel, and an even greater value for money. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Highly recommended!! We stayed at this hotel during Chinese New Year, it was fantastic! The place was spotless with a modern bathroom and comfortable bed. We got a room on the highest level and had a view to the top of the famous oriental pearl tower. As it was chinese new year, we had free firework shows everynight which made our stay even more special. Service was excellent and the hotel offers an affordable buffet breakfast at affordable prices. Anyone looking for a reasonable priced, lovely hotel should consider the Celebrity Apartment. Although a bit far from all the touristy places, it is situated in a quiet neighborhood with taxis your doorstep. "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Great Hotel This was a great hotel for the price, and had a fantastic balcony and view. The room was really clean and there was always at least one staff memeber on duty who spoke English. Not really walking distance from the BUND at all, but easy to find a taxi any time day or night. Also, located less than 1 block from a 7-11 type store, so no worries about having to purchase water or snacks in the hotel. The bed was really comfortable, and the room was bigger than many that I had in China (maybe small by American standards). Highly Suggested! "
rayfont shanghai celebrity hotel apartment ,"Best Value in Shanghai-Excellent Hotel great service We stayed on this hotel from October 16, 2006 through October 25, 2006. The hotel is very well located, the staff is helpful and they even have a concierge. The rooms are very clean and well appointed. The breakfast buffett has everything, including chinese favorites and western style breakfast.The staff english skills are like 7 in a 1 to 10 scale but enough to help you through your stay.. The air conditioning in the rooms is excellent and the broadband access, although has an additional charge, runs very well. The only minor flaw is that the drainage of the bathtubs and toilets are somewhat slowTransportation to and from the hotel is easy as catching a taxi is very easy. The hotel business cards have a map printed in the backside so your cab driver knows how to return you to the hotel.I will not look any further when I go back to Shanghai. This hotel is a winner..

regal international east asia hotel ,"VERY GOOD FOR BUSINESS Spent 3 nights here and enjoyed the services, clean and spacious rooms, gym, and terrific breakfast. The room was quite impressive for the size, cleanliness and decor. The complaint here is that the lights were insufficient for working, IMO. Room rate was quite good I thought.We had some meetings in the spacious lobby bar which has high prices for tea/coffee but this is not unexpected in such a hotel; but one of our meetings was held with complimentary beverages due to my local rep making a deal. The gym is very large but the equipment is average; the size of facility and lack of staff or users made it more like a quiet cavern on that Friday night. Neighborhood had so many bars and nice restaurants, and I really liked the residential feel. There are tall and leafy cottonwood trees lining the avenue for a long distance, and many quiet residential buildings in this area. Plenty of tennis being played on the Saturday so activity is strong around the hotel. This is good.Recommended hotel and neighborhood. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Good hotel good location dont confuse with a hotel at the stadium (similar name) Most of the reviewers are not smart enough to check that this hotel is not the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel which is located at the stadium, but a different hotel. I got a room in some management rooms - you can get their only by using a card in a lift which will take you to the upper floors. It is a good deal as i had breakfast included plus free internet. In addition to it you have your own breakfast area if you want. I liked the location - i was close to all the places i needed to go. Plus there is a great Mexican place Zappatas not far from the hotel. I really liked going there as i was slightly sick of the Chinese food. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Poor Management Excellent staff. 4 star hotel After having stayed here many times over the last 4 years, the hotel has deteriorated to 4 stars:- Poor management from a Hong Kong Assistant Manager who is arrogant and detached from his clientelle.- Stupid yellow smiley faces being worn by hotel staff (is this Mcdonalds ???)- Cheap brown 'new' uniforms being worn by embarrased reception and concierge staff.More importantly is the continual messing about with room rates and benefits.As a Regal Reward Platinum Member I was upgraded to Regal Club floor - only to be told 3 days later that I could not have any of the benefits.Unfortuantely the General Manager is on holiday and unable to respond to my complaint.In Shanghia, you can go better.... "
regal international east asia hotel ,"excellent business hotel I've stayed here twice - for 10 days end of March 2009 &amp; earlier on 6 days in Nov 2008. I like this hotel. Check-in was smooth, room's spacious, clean, quiet, restaurant staff friendly &amp; helpful. Since I was here over a weekend, I used the gym which is very well-equipped. There's a spa &amp; swimming pool here as well. You can play tennis &amp; squash as well.The hotel's located near the business area, no where near the popular tourist spots. I could walk to the office blocks in 5 minutes. A large park is just across the hotel &amp; it's a pleasant walk across this park to the business area. The park is full of activity all day - people playing at the basketball courts, kids in the playground, people enjoying a stroll by the small lakes, &amp; in the evenings folks gather to dance (line-dance, ballroom, etc) which always attracts a big crowd.The location is in what used to be the French Quarter of old Shanghai so there are lots of colonial buildings to look at. The streets around the hotel are tree-lined &amp; away from the hustle &amp; bustle of the main roads. Good for exploring. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"i hated it how depressing if this is the regal east in the football stadium, think twice about staying there....not nice at all. the rooms, mines anyway, was so small and the furnishings basic, more like a travel lodge. view to the back of a stadium, shower height for a midget, bed hard, towels grey, room smelled of smoke etc etc, and it wasnt cheap at 897 a night. staff not nice to me either, e.g. I asked for a breakfast included rate, they wouldnt help me with it at all. they had the cheek to call my room to ask about the service of the stay, when I had put do not disturb on....they really didnt have the first clue about service. No bath robe or slippers in the room either. The most depressing stay as a solo traveller yet...never going back. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Got what we paid for; good location We had a great last minute rate on the Regal as the accommodation we were supposed to stay in became unavailable unexpectedly. I would not consider the hotel a 5-star hotel but would think it measures up very well as a 4-star. The room decor was dated and the bed was harder than usual. However, everything worked well so we really had no complaints. We liked the pillow selection option and thought it a nice touch. The breakfast spread was very good (much wider than the Four Seasons Shanghai) and we loved its location. The hotel didn't have much of a personality but it was certainly clean, well appointed and more than adequate for our purposes, which was a night's stay before travelling to the airport. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Exceptional Service Exceptional &amp; personable service from the moment I checked in for this biz trip until (I'm betting) I check out tomorrow... Breakfast, dinner and brunch buffets amazing and reasonably priced. My back was bothering me and I requested a feather pillow top (thinking it unlikely) and within 10 minutes, housekeeping had it on my bed:). I couldn't resist pushing my luck and called to see if I could get an ergonomical desk chair and it magically appeared. Massages always available and very good. Pool incredible. Concierge resolved a taxi charge to Yunan Gardens that I questioned without a second thought. Laundry service within hours. Good, consistent internet service. Room service always within 15-20 minutes.Maybe the quality of service is just this high in Shanghai but if I return, I'm staying here. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Alright but smallish room Service is ok, better than at other Chinese hotels, but again nothing impressive. The room was quite small, and the decor a bit passe', but all in all functional and clean. I liked the local Chinese restaurant's food, but I am sure there are better options a few minutes from the hotel.I found this hotel too expensive (RMB 1200+15% fees) for its quality (but perhaps Shanghai is like this, I do not know honestly), had to pay for Internet (normal in Chinese hotels..) and breakfast was not included.. Four days after checking out they still haven't cancelled the pre-authorization on my credit card, which is a bit annoying. It is convenient if you come from Hongqiao airport, less so from Pudong. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Clean haven in Shanghai's French neighbourhood Have been in quite a few hotels in Shanghai, but since a local friend recommended this hotel to us, we have stayed here twice. It is a clean haven in a nice neighbourhood. The staff is friendlier than in most Shanghai hotels. The rooms are quite large for a Shanghai hotel. The bed was enormous!The only problem I had with the room is the difficulty to regulate the temperature. The aircon seemed to be set fixed to 24 degrees which is far too cold when it is 37 outside. Whatever we tried, we could not get the temperature up or the aircon fan down.The food in the hotel is not special, but in the neighbourhood there are some very good local restaurants.Before we have stayed in the other Regal East Asia hotel in the stadium, be this one is definitely better! "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Good business hotel far from tourist sites Stayed for four nights in June 2008. Was attending an international conference. The room was nice, although the bed was a little hard and not particularly comfortable. The staff was polite and reasonably helpful. The food at the restaurant was good, although similar food could be found for about 1/3 the price about a block away at a local Chinese restaurant. Although the hotel was adequate, it is very far from most areas that tourists are interested in, so is recommended more for convention/business travelers. "
regal international east asia hotel ,Perfectly Fine I have stayed at the Regal a number of times over the past few years when we come down from Beijing for a break. It is a good hotel but definitely not a destination hotel. It is a place to go if you are looking for clean and comfortable in a fairly good area.The rooms are pretty good and the beds are comfortable. Internet is quite quick and housekeeping do a good job. This is very definitely a business hotel - I probably wouldn't recommend it to a tourist.The concierge is helpful if you have a simple request but they can really struggle if you are looking for something complicated. For example we were trying to find the location of a restaurant and we had to prompt them to go and find out instead of just saying &quot;I don't know.&quot;The bar is pretty good and prompt though the drinks aren't outstanding. I mus admit that I have never eaten there tho I often go across the road to Kevin cafe for cheaper eats.The subway is very close which is good but it can be hard to get taxis (which is true for a lot of hotels in Shanghai).All in all a good business hotel but probably not worth the price. 
regal international east asia hotel ,"Great Hotel for Price Hotel is in diplomat area on Heng Shan Road. It is a beautiful street lined with trees that bloom in the spring. The hotel is in front of the Shanghai International Tennis Center and near a lot of pretty old houses in Shanghai. I am a regular in the hotel because of proximity to my offices. But it is close to good restaurants, shopping and a lot of bars and pubs on Heng Shan Road. Breakfast in hotel is a big spread and OK quality. Parking is free for guests and the car park is well lit and big.Here are the negatives: The regular rooms are kind of old and need upgrading so I choose usually to go to club floor rooms by paying a bit extra. Heng Shan road is very busy on Friday nights and can be difficult to get a taxicab. I am spoilt with free Internet in many hotels in China and hate them charging US$15 per night for it. As a guy there are sometimes pimps wandering outside Heng Shan road offering &quot;services&quot; and they are a nuisance.But all in all a very decent hotel for the price. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"A good choice Having lived in Shanghai it is nice to return to this area and this particular hotel. For those wanting the hussle and bussle of Nanjing Road / The Bund head for JW Marriott / Le Meridien etc, however this hotel is in the middle of the old French Concession / diplonatic area and has lots of lovely bars and restaurants within a short walk - you just have to look around a little bit.The metro station is close by, the bars and restaurants of Hengshan Road are minutes away and a taxi can take you to the famous parts in 5-10 Minutes. The hotel has been refurbished and the standard (deluxe) rooms are spacious and well-appointed. We did not upgrade to the club floor as we preferred to have breakfast out in one of the little coffee shops in the adjacent tree-lined avenues. I am not sure it is worth the extra as the standard rooms are great.Service is good and the location is quiet and nice with great access to all parts of the city. Restaurants close by include Thai, Shanghainese, Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese. Bars include Cottons, Sachas, Irish Bar...Overall a big recommend. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Just OK The hotel is OK; very friendly staff, however it is not really close to anyplace and is quite expensive. The breakfast buffet has a wide selection but is not the best I've had. There are so many options in Shanghai, I'd prefer to stay at a different location next time. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Good place The hotel has a shuttle that you can arrange to meet you at the airport. It is not cheap, but it is very nice to be met at the airport with a sign with you name on it after a 14 hour flight. The staff at the airport speak English, but the drivers do not. Nice rooms, in nice location (in the day time) Close to a park and in a quieter area. I felt very comfortable walking around in the day time. Another associate was not a happy when walking after dark in this area, he had many offer of girls that he did not appreciate.They will ask if you want to upgrade to the Regal club floors for an extra charge, but unless you plan to have a lot of drinks at happy hour, or have a lot of time off during the day, you will pay a large premium for free Internet and breakfastDon't worry too much about getting a room on a high floor, the air pollution in Shanghai is so bad that you will not be able to see that far. The view is a bit clearer on the weekends compared to weekdays.The rooms are nice, with individual climate control that worked well. The beds were a bit firm, but this seems to be a common style in China, and I was still able to sleep well. The front desk staff had excellent English skills, and even the housekeeping staff spoke English. The breakfast buffet was excellent. It had a large choice of both western and Chinese dishes to choose from. You could get the chef to prepare eggs the way you wanted. Food hygiene was good, I had no problems after eating here. The lunch and dinner is good here as well, but much more expensive that other restaurants in the area. There is a large over priced shopping area a few blocks away. Lots of designer names, but with price tags higher than in Europe.The room had wired Internet that worked well. The room safe was large enough to put a laptop computer in. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"A home away from home The Regal is located very centrally in Shanghai and is close to many restaurants and bars. A short 10min walk and you are at a crossroads of large multi-story shopping malls. Whether electronics or fashion is your thing this is the place to go.The 5th floor has been recently renovated and has been finished superbly. Photos attached. The 5th floor is part of the Regal Club and is available by upgrade. The extra cost of about 400 Yuan is well worth the extra comfort. There are also significant benefits &amp; discounts offered as part of the deal. E.g. Free evening beverages in the club lounge between 5:30 - 8:00, breakfast in the club lounge on the 4th floor (4th floor also newly renovated), 2 items pressed per day, 50% discount on the mini bar, 30% discount off of all food &amp; beverages within the Hotel, Discounted laundry service, express laundry at the standard laundry rate plus many more benefits. It is easy to make the savings of the extra 400 Yuan to make it worth your while.They have also renovated the lobby bar and restaurant and they have again done an outstanding job. As a regular to the Regal, I was very impressed with the upgrades that have been made to the Hotel. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"A pleasant stay We stayed at this hotel in May 2006. It is in the French concession which is a lovely, characterful area. There are quite a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. It is a lovely area to go strolling. Right across from the hotel is a small supermarket. Although not in the business/tourist district, we took taxis and they were very reasonable. It is helpful to have the Name and address of the hotel and places you want to go to, on hand in chinese. Some cab drivers do not understand English.The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. We complained about our room smelling of smoke and we were moved to non-smoking floor. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with cable TV. The bathrooms are great as well.The breakfast buffet had a nice selection of Eastern, Western and fruit.We bought snacks from the supermarket across from the hotel. We were about 5 minutes cab ride away from one of the big markets in Shanghai.As female travellers we felt very safe in this area and hotel. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"ehhh...... not bad, but you can find better. kinda in the middle of nowhere, so prepare to take cabs everywhere. rooms are clean, but kinda plain. bed is so so. "
regal international east asia hotel ,you can do a lot better there are a lot of much better choices in shanghai than this place. in need of updating. indifferent service. inconvenient location. 
regal international east asia hotel ,"Great service a delight My children and I had a wonderful time this past week at this hotel. The room was well-appointed and clean, the beds comfortable. Felix Hu, the senior sales manager with whom I made the reservations, communicated with me by email quickly. He also arranged for our train tickets to Hangzhou where my daughters and I stayed for three days upon our arrival to China before we visited Shanghai. He had a car pick us up at the airport, give us our train tickets, and take us to the train station. On returning to Shanghai, they had taken care of the luggage we didn't want to take with us to Hangzhou and had our room ready. The staff was extraordinarily helpful, all speaking English. The hotel is located in the French Concession area, a lovely part of Shanghai. It's not in the center of the tourist areas or the business district but a much nicer and less crowded area. We took taxis to get to our destinations which cost usually less than $2 each time. The buffet breakfast in the hotel was ample and with great selection. My daughters enjoyed the bowling alley in the hotel several times during our stay. On leaving, Mr. Hu gave us a beautiful photo book of Shanghai to remember our stay. We travel a good deal for holidays and would happily stay here again. "
regal international east asia hotel ,A little out of the way For a Shanghai hotel it really is pretty good for its value. The property is owned by the Hong Kong Regal Chain and one can tell that they paid enough attention in order to cater to westerners. The hotel is a little out of the way so one needs to tack on an extra 10-15 minutes per cab ride. The rooms are fairly large by Shanghai 4 star standard. Unfortunately the carpet is a little worn out and the place can use a little updating. The staff throughout the hotel is very friendly and efficient. For budget travelers I would highly recommend it. If your company is paying for it then head on over to Sofitel or JW Marriott where you will be closer to the business districts. The internet connection is a little pricey. I would just walk around the corner to the internet cafe where 3RMB takes care of one hour of log in. 
regal international east asia hotel ,"OK This hotel get's mine &quot;above average&quot; rating in fact only for the great and spacious room as well for the delicious breakfast buffet with plenty of Asian and Western high quality food.The total hotel concept is however rather &quot;cold&quot; and check-in feels more like entering a governmental building than a relaxing hotel. I have missed the feeling of being welcome; I just had the feeling of having been booked in &quot;a place to sleep&quot;. I wouldn't advise this hotel for a long holiday stay, but it is OK for a short business visit. "
regal international east asia hotel ,"Nice place but a little noisy... We stayed 7 nights at the Regal in June 2004. Upon arrival, the hotel staff spoke excellent English and were very pleasant to deal with. The rooms are fairly nice and spacious including these nice down comforters that almost felt as comfortable as the Westin's Heavenly Beds. My only complaint was they placed us in a room next to one that had construction so we heard multiple pounding noises from the work throughout the afternoon and evenings. I would not suggest room service, as the food was mediocre and there are tons of nice and cheaper restaurants nearby. Most service charges in the hotel were fairly high and comparable to any NYC hotel which also quite surprised me. An example includes paying $4USD for a Coke at the hotel when you get one across the street at the store for $0.30. The hotel is also located on the West side of Shanghai so its a bit farther from most tourist attractions. Although, taxis and the metro system there made commuting to those other areas fairly simple and cheap. "
regal international east asia hotel ,??????????? 
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Decent hotel interesting location This hotel is actually inside a soccer stadium. If you stay in a room between 1st and 9th floor you won't have a street view (you will be looking at the inside/lobby of the stadium. The basic rooms are slow but very clean and well-equipped. The hotel has a nice restaurant which serves great breakfast (combination of Chinese and western food). It has a health spa in the lobby which looks plush from the outside. There are some stores and a bar also located in the stadium. Not sure if there is anything else nearby. Overall, not crazy about the location but the hotel itself is very nice as a 4-star facility. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Brilliant. Great rooms food and staff. Impressive lobby. Very clean hotel.. Big rooms. Everything almost new. Great breakfasts. Swimming pool, massage, fitness. Everything you need. Hotel is the part of Shanghai Stadium (built.in). Taxi drivers had problems to find the hotel. You have to show them the key with chinese name and address of the hotel. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"All depends which room you get Stayed for a five-night business trip and I have to say that both room standard and service quality is extremely variable, depending on which room you get or whom of the many staff you deal with. On the website the hotel looks like a good idea and very different from others as it claims to have great views of the inside of Shanghai Stadium. As I had booked a &quot;stadium view&quot; room I was looking forward to this experience but as it turned out my room looked onto an interior staircase of the stadium, and most of my colleagues had the same problem. Many of the &quot;stadium view&quot; rooms are very small and most of them pitch-dark even during the day as the do not get any sunlight at all. My second room, to which I was only moved after hours of negotiation and dealing with no less than five staff, was very different: bright, airy, large windows, views (of a flyover, but at least it did have a view of sorts). Some staff were very nice and courteous, others were plain rude. I felt that as long as operations were running smoothly staff were in a well-rehearsed friendly routine, but whenever things went wrong many of them turned into a &quot;not my problem, try somebody else&quot; mode. Overall, an average experience. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Very Convenient Hotel This hotel was selected for me by my company, so I did not know what to expect. From my research, it appeared to be far away from the downtown area of Shanghai. It proved to be a very convenient location, as it was easy to get to it by taxi. It is also a block away from the subway. Considering the extensive road construction in Shanghai, not all hotels are easy to get to, even though they may be more central, and not all hotels necessarily have a great supply of taxis waiting outside.My room was very large, and quite clean. Their breakfast buffet had many choices - typical Chinese, Japanese, and European/North American.There was consistently a fleet of taxis waiting outside, which given their inexpensive price, was my preferred mode of transportation in Shanghai. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to my friends, for sure. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Great experience at the Regal Stayed for one night at the Regal. Although I had only booked a club floor room, I was upgraded to a club floor suite when I checked in - a pleasant surprise! Suite was very well appointed with central lighting control, electronic blinds, 3 LCD TV's and a massive bathroom with a muti-head shower. Several of the items (including beer) in the mini-bar were complementary as well - a nice touch.The room included buffet breakfast, which was good, as well as high speed internet. Can't think of anything negative to say except that the location may not be ideal for tourists, since it was a longish (35 min) , 45 RMB cab ride from Pudong to the hotel. "

regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"After location confusion a good experience The Regal Hotel group should be scolded for (purposeful deception) . It has two Shanghai properties, both called Regal East Asia. One of them (not this one) has the word &quot;international&quot; innocuously inserted into its title, but it is also frequently omitted. So if you book this hotel thinking that you're on Hengshan Road (a happening nightlife area) you're wrong. This hotel is located inside the Shanghai Sports stadium ground, set back from the road. Easy to miss unless your taxi driver has been here before. Other than the location switch, this hotel does exceed expectations. The outfittings are relatively new and high quality, rooms have plenty of light and are well designed (for use of space). All amenities are provided, as if this were a five star hotel. The pool is also excellent: 20 meters, infinity edge, and clean. And, rooms have a view of the sports stadium. The downside is that this hotel is located in a &quot;local&quot; but up-and coming middle class area of Shanghai. It's out of the way (centrally) but convenient for taking the metro, being on the intersection of two metro lines. If you don't mind the southwest Shanghai location and lack of foreign-oriented diversions, this hotel could work for you. "

regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Lost our privacy Great location, and rooms were clean and comfortable. Interesting hotel outlook. However, when we checked-in, the front desk persuaded me not to pay a deposit...and if we agreed, they will take away all the foods and drinks out from the fridge. And seems nothing lost, then we agreeded, later when we arrived the room for already 30 mins, and we were taking a rest, I was sleeping on bed, and my boyfriend was walking around with his little shorts...suddenly, someone opened the door by their keys...and we shouted. Is their staff. I cried what's happend? And she said she didn't know guests were inside, and she was coming to collect all the foods and drinks in the fridge...Oh~I thought this was annoyed, you know? Since we have been here and checked in for already 30 mins...and this is strange for the staff to come in suddenly, and it ruined our privacy, I was going to complain but she said sorry to us, so I forgave her then. Besides this experience, the hotel is nice. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Solid Hotel at a Good Price I stayed 4 nights at the Regal Shanghai East Asia hotel and had a pretty good experience. I booked this hotel based on the room rates and the close proximity to the Metro Station.Check-in was fine, apart from I had to point out that breakfast was included in my room rate. The room itself was better than I expected and was a pretty decent size and standard. The bathroom was clean.The Metro station is a 2 minute walk away and from there the rest of Shanghai is easily accessible - I just wish the trains ran an hour or two later at night! You pass a Starbucks on the way to the Metro station and there is a supermarket built in to the other side of the stadium.This is a good hotel, and while it doesn't have any of Shanghai's main attractions on it's doorstep, I was willing to sacrifice that in order to save some cash. The Metro is efficient enough and taxis are cheap so that the location doesn't make much difference. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Interesting location! I stayed at the Regal Shanghai for 6 nights very recently. As the hotel part of the Shanghai stadium, it is fairly easy for taxi riders to find. The fare from Pudong airport was about 170 RMB. The hotel reception is ok, we had booked a Regal Club room so we used the check-in at the 12th floor. The lounge staff were very helpful and nice all throughout our stay, assisting us with restaurant bookings etc. There was a lady called Kris and she was a star! The lounge (breakfast and evening drinks + snacks are included in the rate plan) is a bit old fashioned but ok. The selection for food is limited but as the lounge is never very busy (only saw about a max of 10 people there at any one time), I guess it is not worth for the hotel to provide more. Everything we had and tried was perfectly fine. Our room, 1215, was one of the old rooms. The hotel is having re-vamp at the moment and quite rightly so. The furniture is very 1980's and the carpet has seen better days. The size of the room was great and everything worked. The rates in general are decent considering that most 3-4* hotels in Shanghai are very pricey. The tube station is only about 5 mins walk away and there are plenty of taxis. I didn't use any of the hotel facilities (shops, spa etc) but they all look ok. Moods bar, also on the 12th Floor, is ok but lacks atmosphere. The French Concession is a great place to wonder about and Sasha's (a western style bar) is not far. M on Bund was great for a meal as was Shintori. The People 7 bar was very trendy but service wasn't that great. There is a bar on Julu Road called the Goodfellas ( a bit seedy) but they give our free beer if you go early in the evening! A river cruise in the evening is a must - the view is amazing. Perhaps one of the nicest days we had was a day trip to one of the canal towns. The nearest one is only about 1 1/2 hrs from Shanghai and the tour buses leave from Shanghai stadium. A top tip - you might need some help in buying the tickets unless your Chinese is great. Another highlight was a trip to the Propaganda Poster Arts Museum. It can be a bit difficult to find but once you get there, it's very interesting. I will definitely go back to Shanghai again but most likely will stay somewhere a bit more central. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Great and a bit different ! Stayed for 6 nights on a leisure break in October 2006.Was a bit apprehensive as this brand was not a known quantity, however I needn't have worried.Location is slightly out of centre, to the south west of the main attractions, but the hotel is very accessible to metro station (2 mins walk), and cabs are easy to get. I think the location is a plus point as it means you get much better value than a comparable place in a tourist location.The building itself, within Shanghai Stadium, is very impressive.My wife and I stayed in a Regal Club room (there was a special offer on the hotel website of USD 130 per night). This entitled us to check-in on the 'club' (12th) floor, and meant we were entitled to free breakfast, evening drinks and canapes, and various other extras. I would highly recommend booking this class of room.The club lounge had an excellent view over the stadium, we were lucky that there was a pop concert on the first night of our stay - very interesting !Our room was very large, clean, with all the facilities to be expected of a 4-star property. The decoration was a bit old fashioned for our taste, I would have preferred something a bit more contemporary. Not a major problem, however, and everything was in good condition. Bed was very hard, I actually like that, but be warned if you like a soft mattress.We did not dine at the hotel except to take the complimentary breakfast and canapes, however these were of good quality. The drinks were also a bonus - basically a full bar from which you could help yourself - quite easy to overdo it !All staff at the hotel were great, very polite, excellent English, and extremely helpful. They booked us restaurants, trips, cabs, the works.In short, I would not hesitate to stay here again, don't let the apparent 'remote' location put you off.PS Some friends of ours booked one of the cheapest rooms - it was OK but pretty small and a bit tatty - I would def recommend a higher class room. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"loved the hotel going to shanaghai to visit our daughter who was working there. booked this 4* hotel for four nights, on 6th october, fabulous price of 97 pounds sterling room only, for 2 people. did not expect much at this price very pleasantly surprised. gorgeous hotel. staff excellent. accommodation first-class. did not have time to use their excellent leisure facilities. hotel located very near the metro. which is very convenient and extremely cheap - about 28 pence to the bund, and other places of interest. definitely recommend. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Very nice hotel This is a very nice hotel. Our room was very comfortable, good ammenities. All staff were very helpful. Pool and hot tub area are nice - close by 9:30 PM. Be careful not to confuse this hotel with the Regal INTERNATIONAL East Asia Hotel which is located in the French concession and closer to the city center. This is a great hotel if you will be flying out of Hong Qiao Airport (only took about 20 minutes to get there.) But, otherwise it is a bit far from the major attractions. Metro stops are placed quite far apart in Shanghai. The hotel is actually attached to the stadium - (makes it easier for cab drivers to find). You can get to the hotel from Pudong airport using public transport (mag lev to green metro line, change at people's square to red line - exit metro to the left and walk about 5-10 min.) but, if you have luggage we would recommend taking a taxi. They do offer miles but room rate has to be at least 700 CYN. We booked on the internet for $57. Overall, we were very happy here, especially for such a good rate and would stay again especially if flying out of HongQaio. "
regal shanghai east asia hotel ,"Great Hotel and Value! Although The Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel is a 3 star hotel, I found it much much better than the 4 star hotel I stayed at in Beijing (the Swissotel). Reasons I liked the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel: my room and bathroom were clean; the room size was lager than I expected for a standard room; the room was decorated in a modern and simple yet elegant way; the staff was friendly and spoke English well; the subway is just around the corner and up the block; not far from most attractions by subway. I cannot think of a complaint about it really... "

renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great facilities and rooms I've stayed here multiple times and again in Nov. 2009. The rooms are very functional, clean, and just right. The plugs, internet, desk, phone etc. are all very nice. The location near Century park is good or bad depending on what you want to do. Others have complained about not much around, which is true for the immediate area, but if you go one direction for about 1 km, you get to the MTR station and that will get you to all the hustle and bustle in less than 30 minutes. In the other direction, for about 1 km, you will get a nice group of restaurants (some western), Carrefour, Starbucks etc. Both are relatively easy walking distance. I usually walk down to the Starbucks for an expensive cup of coffee and get some pastry near by. If you want to be somewhat more adventurous, you can walk to the next block in the morning and get a traditional Chinese breakfast for a song (a meat bun is 1.2 yuan - less than 20 cents USD). There is also a Family Mart right across the street where you can get water and other quick stuff. Since my business in further east than the hotel, this is a good place for me. The rates are really good for Shanghai. During this trip, I also stayed at the Crowne Plaza right next door and the Renaissance is much, much better. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,Very good price but not the best location If your travels take you to Shanghai and you plan to travel to locations around the city on this side of the river this place is convenient. If you want to be in the city center and walk to places of interest this is not the place to stay. I stayed here 4 yrs ago and last week again - and while the rooms are in nice shape the hotel itself is off the beaten track and has no local feel to it. Just not much going on here. The room rate was really low - like $75/night - which is a big value in Shanghai for a Marriott property. The JW Tommorrow's Square property wanted $300+ on the same week. The lobby and bars are nicely appointed and are modern and clean. The room was in nice shape too but I didnt feel that comfortable walking around near the building. Lots of local hustle and bustle - not many foreigners though out and about. This place is highly comfortable and functional but you don't get any flavor for the city staying here. 
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Cutting Cost on Customers Hotel uses saving evironmental as an excuse to trip their own cost by halving and eleminate the supply of basic amenities set in the rooms. Everything you want like an extra pair of slippers, a comb etc. you will have to ask for it. It is very annoying and inconvenient. Why don't they just leave the toiletory kits in the room. This is a cheap skate service attitude!Like other 4 and 5 stars hotels in China, internet connection is very expensive (RMB120). You pay the 4-5 star price for the facilities and you have to pay again to use it. The best value for money in China is 3-star hotels, where Internet connection is free and some even include breakfast.Rooms are getting old wih varnishes start to crack on furniture. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great service great restaurants and wonderful rooms The rooms were nice and spacious, and the bed was one of the most comfortable ones that i've ever slept in. We were upgraded to the club level, which gave us clug lounge access (free breakfast, appetizers, and drinks). The hotel had at least 5 restaurants in it (2 on second floor, 2 of third floor, and Japanese on first floor). The service was excellent in all areas. The restaurant prices were on the expensive side, as well as the drycleaning services. The only complaint was the location... 2-3 blocks from shopping mall/other restaurants and a short taxi ride away from any site seeing. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Simply great! Just a great place, simple as that! Very nice rooms and the food is perfect. Just don't be fooled by the business bar on one of the upper floors, it's not worth the extra money for the &quot;free&quot; breakfast. Instead just go to the main restaurant downstairs and stuff yourself with the most delicious Chinese (but also Western) food. At night, go to the Chinese restaurant and order a Peking Duck, it's awesome! In the lobby they even had a puppetmaster making little claydough puppets for free, just to take along; so cute! "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,Comfortable and very big rooms Comfortable and very big rooms. Location is ok: about 10 minutes walk from the nearest MTR station that takes you into Shanghai centre. Few small shops nearby. 
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Fits the bill Clean, modern conveniences and western sized room. Good for new side of Shanghai, about a 50 RMB ride to old Shanghai. 11 RMB to the maglev terminal to go to Pudong airport. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Felt very comfortable here Travelled to Shanghai recently on business and stayed here for a week. The hotel decor is very stylish throughout - modern, with a Chinese touch. The room was homely and offered everything I wanted. The bed was exceedingly comfortable - ten out of ten - and the service was fine. The area was fine for me personally - my office was two stops down on the underground - and there are a large number of cafés, restaurants and shops catering (also) to a western public. But if being downtown is important to you, there are probably other options.One comment - previously I stayed at the much more expensive Shangri-La, but I found this hotel equally nice. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Good Hotel if not for the smell The bed was comfy and room looked nice. It even had 2 phone lines so my mom &amp; I can both talk to difference folks back home at the same time. The problem I had was that the room smelled like yhe sewer, which emanated from the bathroom. I looked everywhere, and room was clean. I called the front desk to change rooms. They said they would call back when they are done checking in guests. But they never called back and I never switched rooms. I am not sure if weather in May causes this smell because that same smell emanated from the streets of Shanghai as well. Perhaps it’s the pollution from the factories…A few other things to note: • the concierge was not very help and spoke very limited English• The food at this hotel was delicious and I highly recommend the breakfast. Unless you are willing to venture to shops that have no English signs and ask for food, this is probably your best bet in the area. • It is about a 15 minute walk to the closest subway station, which has a great knock off shopping mall as part of the station. Don’t let the small mall entrance deceive you, it is massive with tons of stores. • There is very little night life around this area &amp; not close to any particular sights. You will need to head out to Shanghai's city center for that "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Classy comfortable and luxiorous 1) Very Close to the Exhibition Centre in Pudong2) Comfortable and Luxirious Rooms3) Excellent Breakfast spread4) Great Lobby5) Good serviceThe bloch to the whole experience was , i misplace my expensive cell phone in the hotel and never found it. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"A good hotel in a bad position The hotel itself was very very good and for overnight visitors that need a hotel close to the airport it would be a good place to stay. However, I found it too far out from the city and not at all the place to be. When I saw some of the other hotels in the centre of Shanghai I realised I had made a huge mistake. Saying that though, the hotel rooms, service and food were very good. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"hate to tell people this is a nice hotel bcz it's going to drive up the price i've been staying at this hotel around 5 times a year since its opening. agree to most of the recent comments listed here. don't quite understand the one saying this hotel is only a four star by american standards - i have never seen a nicer renaissance in the states - maybe i've been going to the &quot;wrong&quot; places.true, it's in a resididential area. but there are convenient stores, restaurants, bars and a foot massage parlor right across the streets. and there are more choices within walking distance (you'll have to get directions from hotel people). if you are one of those guys or gals who like to go to xintiandi or hengshan road every night this location might be a bit inconvenient. food, drinks and lundry service at the hotel are very expensive - american prices. on top of all that the internet isn't free, something like 15 bucks for 24 hours. but you always can go out to eat and drink. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great experience Renaissance I stayed for 4 nights in Renaissance, Shanghai Pudong. This is one of the best hotels I have seen in Shanghai. The lobby is huge. The ambience is very good. The rooms are very well maintained and have an excellent view of the city. The bathroom is very good. There is a choice of restaurants available for food. The swimming pool and health club are great. I would definitely recommend this hotel. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great Business Hotel One of the best Renaissance hotels I have stayed at in China. It is a bit out of the way - surrounded by residential area - however taxis are easy to come by and quite cheap. Also Metro line 2 is about a 15 minute walk (Shanghai Science and Technology Museum station). Also there is a large shopping area (Xiangyang Market) in the metro station similar to Silk Market in Beijing with copies of western brands. On the same Metro line 2 you can go across river to heart of Bund area (Nanjing Road) in about 15 minutes for a couple of dollars. Faster and less expensive than taxi.Hotel still looks quite new, beds comfortable (standard Marriott) and room size and bathroom was above average in size and very clean. Food in restaurants was good but more expensive than eating out. Wide selection of western dishes and pretty good service. Small market (like 7-11) just across street if you need to buy water or other supplies. This will be my new place to stay when visiting Shanghai. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Fantastic Stunning Marriott Hotel on the Eastern side of Shanghai. Staff at every point were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Beautifully appointed public rooms, lovely bar. Nice to be able to smoke at the bar... Don't miss the quiet little garden on the roof (Level 6 by the pool). Breakfast unhurried and great selection. Location is ok, away from some of the traditional sightseeing areas, but as previously mentioned taxis are very cheap, about 40RMB's to get anywhere you need to. Don't try to walk anywhere at this time of the year, so hot so humid. The hotel was a cool oasis. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Beautiful central Shanghai hotel! This is a beautiful Marriott property! I would rate it a 9 in the US.I stayed here for 16 days in May June of 2008 and it was a beautiful hotel.The rooms are spacious and the beds new and luxurious. 6 pillows and I had an excellent view of the park and city.I was here on business and had a few days off for pleasure. You can walk everywhere and taxis are cheap. Be careful of the taxis outside their areas they are totally confused and lost!! We learned this the hard way and got lost several times.Make sure to get a hotel card from the concierge as it will be your only hope back in a taxi!They have good maps and can help a lot but get detailed instructions in Chinese and have them circle the destination and the hotel for the trip.We visited the club lounge daily for high quality happy hour and great food stuff. The team in the club lounge bend over backwards to please and wait hand and foot on clients. There is excellent wired and wireless internet that seems to be free and unrestricted. I was able to connect to all my usual US sites without any problems. The hotel is beautifully decorated.Beware the lobby bar lounge though. We went down often and saw ladies of the evening working the crowd hard for business. It was obvious the staff were well aware and chummed up to the girls between their rounds to the often intoxicated business mens rooms. My friends and I saw this every night in the lounge.They tried us as well but we just ignored them so they left us alone after the second night. The food is pretty good in the lounge but the alcohol is outrageous. 7-9 USD per drink or beer.Across the street at the Family Mart you can get water, beer, alcohol, and much more dirt cheap!I paid between 1200 - 1500- 1900 Yuan depending on the nights for the room. Laundry is very expensive to send out.I will stay here again as it's probably one of the nicest hotels in China! "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Nice but thin veneer The Renaissance Pudong is a nice, quiet hotel with wonderful service. However, it is four-star quality by American standards. It is a very standard business hotel with a thin, 5-star veneer. It is closer to the Pudong airport than the Hongqiao, so if you're coming in domestically, you might want to book something more central. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"quite even on New Years Eve Having spent 8 nights on hard Chinese beds in the western part of China, the comfortable, softer bed was a welcome night's rest. The room was a comfortable size, spotlessly clean, with crisp white linens, in our standard room. Marble floors in the bath were cool to the touch but the heat in the rooms was easy to adjust during this very cold time in China. Hot water was prompt and plentiful for good showers. Nice large towel for after a shower. Plenty of amenities in the bathroom. The staff was very helpful with all services, prompt check in and out, cabs in seconds, as were bellmen for luggage. English was plentiful for those of us who know only 2 or 3 words of Chinese.The breakfast buffet was large and plenty of choices plus you could order eggs any way you wanted. We were late getting down at 10AM, the reception staff called up to see if they were still serving. They told them to send us up and they would hold breakfast for us...the entire buffet. They didn't break any of it down until we reassured them we were full and didn't want any more. It was pricey compared to other cities we'd been to, but it is Shanghai where you expect to pay more. It was good with all types of food on it. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Enjoyed my stay I was in Shanghai for business in August. This hotel was recommended to me by coworkers. The hotel had a nice interior and my room was spacious. The hotel was staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is in the newer part of Shanghai. For business, this was nice. There are a lot of ex-pats living and staying the area. I found the restaurants in the area were very accomodating for non-Chinese speakers and almost all had picture menus! There were many restaurants within walking distance and some shopping also. If you plan to do a lot of sight seeing, I would recommend staying on the other side of the river. I spent my weekends and evenings checking out the sights. The cab ride accross the river to Nanjing Road or the Old City in the evenings takes at least 30 minutes. However, if this doesn't bother you, this is a nice place to stay "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"A Nice Hotel in a Decent Location The Renaissance Shanghai Pudong is a nice hotel, but not outstanding.The check-in was fairly prompt and courteous. The room is relatively spacious with the one highlight being its contemporary-styled bathroom. The bed is firm and relatively comfortable, but fussy sleepers might not like it.The buffet breakfast is excellent - the food is tasty and the selection is huge.And the location is pretty good with the closest MRT station (ShanghaiTech and Science Museum) about a 10 minute walk away. Across the street is a pub, a convenience store and a DVD shop (I recommend the DVD shop because it's cheap, it has a lot of titles and the DVDs work). If you walk a couple of more blocks you'll find a bunch of restaurants to choose from. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Very nice hotel This is a very nice hotel, 5 stars. Accommodations are very nice with very comfortable beds and very clean rooms. The bathroom is spacious with a tub and shower and the living area is very large. The room (25th floor) was very quiet with no street sounds or sounds from neighboring rooms.The staff is very helpful in arranging taxis and the concierge desk helpful with questions.There is internet access in the room, 120 RMB per 24 hours.The TV features several English speaking channels.I ate many breakfasts in The Brasserie on the 2nd floor and found the buffet to be very good with a nice food selection and good service. There are dinner buffets served here also and again the food selection is very good and the quality and service very good. For those wishing to eat elsewhere, there are a number of choices within a 10-15 minutes walk.There is a nice bar and sitting area with entertainment.The hotel is approximately 40-50 minutes by taxi from the Pudong airport (cost ~140 RMB) and approximately 60 minutes from Hongqiao Airport (cost ~85 RMB.)This was my second stay at this hotel and I recommend it. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great hotel We stayed at the hotel for two nights during a recent multi-city tour of China. It was an excellent experience. The rooms were very large clean, and the bathroom had both a shower and a tub (with a retractable clothesline). Furnishings were comfortable and elegant. The buffet breakfast was generous and offered both Chinese and Western food. Use of computers with Internet access in the business center, as I recall, was approximately 8 USD for 15 minutes, which didn't seem terribly unreasonable. Taxis were readily available, and cost about 25 RMB (3 USD) to the Bund. There are two laundries nearby, and a large shopping center with many restaurant options and a Carrefours within a 10 minute walk. (Most restaurant menus included pictures and English.) Concierge was very helpful. The nearest metro station was a leisurely 15-minute walk. We paid $125 per night (including breakfast) through our travel agent, which was an incredible bargain by US standards. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Nice Hotel but beware the rip-off internet I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Mid September. It is very nice and plush, but compared with other hotels in China, not that cheap. My biggest gripe was that in a country where broadband internet access costs around $100 a year they want close on $25 a day which is unacceptable in any country in my view, let alone China. I guess they think they can get away with it since it is essential to the business travellers they are clearly aiming at. Yes, it’s a nice hotel with good gym and breakfast (similar price to the internet if not included in the room rate!), the room is nice but not that large, but it is in an out-of-the-way part of Pudong which requires a taxi to get anywhere or a brisk 10 minute walk to the metro. There is not much around the hotel except a Japanese and Korean restaurant (both OK and cheap) and a sports bar (aimed at hotel guests and priced to match). Did I like the hotel? Yes. Would I stay there again? No. I will only be ripped off once by a hotel and frankly there are lots of really excellent hotels in Shanghai that offer better value and location "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great in many ways Stayed there on business. 5 star quality. Located in residential area so minimal traffic and crowds. Never waited more than 1 minute for taxi unlike other hotels. Primo room decor and modern fixtures, at least on floors 19 and 21 where I stayed. Could not find ice machine. Was told to order it. Free broadband internet - cable provided. Has plug that accepts US prongs but warning: it's still 220v for dual voltage laptops. Exec level is worth it since it provides free beverages, liquor, ice, english newspapers, large lounge and small buffet - I think 24hrs. Fitness center is large and clean with weights, good variety of equipment and water cooler. Their buffet restaurant 200RMB Fri-Sat special and maybe other days too, is a much needed break from local cuisine since it has a cook to order grill offering filet, sirloin, lamb chops, whole and fileted fish. A relief to have mass quantities of plain grilled meats. It also had a freezer full of Hagen Das. Unlimited. Video store across the street has DVDs for 20 RMB. Taxi to Nanjing Rd for shopping about 40 RMB, to Super Brand Mall about 20 RMB. Take the Maglev train 40RMB to PVG - its' speed will astound you- 7 minutes better than the 35-40 minute taxi. Hotel is~ 8 taxi minutes away from Maglev station--again no traffic. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"My new favorite place to stay in the Shanghai area Gorgeous lobby, lavish room, very good price. This hotel has it all, except that it is a little far from the &quot;corner&quot; of Pu Dong near Shanghai and the Pearl Tower. Frankly the cabs are so inexpensive in Shanghai that the location is not a problem. I stayed there on my last day in China so that I would be close to the Mag Lev train that goes to the airport. It's very close to that station ($18 RMB by cab.)We had dinner at one of the two restaurants inside the hotel, and I had Pad Thai for about $60 RMB ($8.00 US) and a nice bottle of California wine for about $32.00 US. Not a rip-off at all.Very highly recommended. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"A great stay I just returned from a week in Shanghai where I stayed at the Reniasance Shanghai Pudong. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Asia.The room on the club floor was large and well designed with plenty of closet space, a very comfortable bed and a large bathroom with both a tub and a shower. The club room came along with access to the club on the 26th floor which was open 24 hours and staffed for 18. They served a hearty breakfast with an assortment of western and chinese dishes and plenty of fresh fruit. The staff was courtious and friendly and were fluent in English. There was a wide assortment of chinese and english newspapers available.All of the service people (from the front desk, to the taxi station, restaurants, club center, buisiness center and cleaning staff) were courtious and friendly. They all spoke English to one extent or another. The Brasserie afforded a nice mixture of chinese and western dishes. The only drawback (and it is not the hotel's fault) is that the location is so new that the taxi drivers somethimes had trouble finding it. My recommendation is to take the direction card from the hotel with you and show it to the taxi driver. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Best hotel I found in China We spent only one night, but it was a memorable one. The room and bathroom were spacious and beautifully decorated. The restaurant dinner and breakfast buffets would compare favorably with anywhere. We would definitely stay again. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Good Hotel in a quiet area Great Hotel located in the not yet developed Pudong area, however it is only 10min. far from downtown. The Hotel is very nice, great rooms with a superb bathroom. At this moment the only inconvenience you may find are the building constrcution around the hotel, therefore make sure to have a room on the upper floors.Staff is very kind and efficient.There is a CD and DVD's shop just in front of the hotel!! it is very good and cheap.With regard to the MAGLEV train, i gotta say that it is awsome, however, it is not so fast as they said as it only goes at a max. speed of 301 km/h. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"5 Star Service- You get what you pay for This place definitely lives up to eloquence of it's lobby decor. The breakfast buffet is much better than other western hotels in Shanghai and the wait staff will catch your napkin before it hits the floor. The rooms are beautiful, maybe a bit small by American standards, but perfectly configured so you hardly realize the size.The negatives: Not many...except price...they get you big for internet, so be judicious when you hit the VPN for emails. It also isn't very cost effective to dine here. Shanghai (not neccesarily the Pudong area) has TONS of great restaraunts that can deliver the same quality food at 25% of the cost. Considering it's a $3-$10 cab ride to most dining districts, you should not hesitate to hit the town for the evening.Of course the area really isn't the same as being near the downtown area, if you go for walks, you'll just hit commercial construction projects and perhaps some residential high-rises. It's about a 15 min cab to the city bustle (in China terms).If you are flying in, consider taking the 300 mph Maglev train...it's only route is from the Pudong airport to a stop slightly south of this hotel....(it was a demo line to try and sell a country wide project). To and from the airport are the only times you'd ride this train. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Most Memorable Feature: Grand Lobby... This hotel lived up to expectations of what was expected of a 5 star chain hotel. The bathroom was huge relative to size of bedroom. Decor was oriental themed calligraphy with liberal splashes of red and gold. The bed was comfortable and turndown service included a cookie as well as the weather forecast for the following day. However, service could be improved and more initiative taken esp. with the front desk staff. Our party of 3 (we booked 2 rooms) wanted to check in but were told that our rooms were still not available despite us arriving at the standard check in time. Reason being that the hotel was running at full occupancy the previous night. (Shouldn’t provisions been made?) After much discussion, the manager reluctantly gave us 1 room (which was apparently available but did not show up on the system initially.) Manager claimed that the room was in need of room maintenance however we found nothing spoilt or 'unusual' about the room when we checked in.Overall, our stay was pleasant. Admittedly, Pudong is a considerable distance away from the city centre but the average cab ride cost only about 30Yuan. Enroute, you pass by landmark constructs such as the Nan Pu “suspension” Bridge as well as drink in the sight of the Shanghai Bund. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Lovely Hotel As some ppl stated that the location is not the best but the hotel itself is really nice. Nice decor, super clean and comfortable bed! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who does not mind taking a cab every time. If taking a cab with non-English speaking driver bothers you, this is not the hotel for you.... "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Amazing Hotel This hotel may not be the most convienient if you want access to the city, but if you are attending any type of convention at the New Shanghai Convention Center (CINEC) this place is the ticket. The staff could not be any more friendly, and if you are coming in from the airport, you can arrange a car from the front desk to pick you up. ( Buick Regal ) The hotel car is a bit more then a taxi, but it is air conditioned and clean. I can't say that for the taxis. I happen to be here during a Typhoon, they say it is one of the worst in 8 years. The staff here will do anything for you, and there is always someone to greet you no matter where you are. You can work out in the nicely appointed gym, and when you are done get an hour long massage for about $35.00 USD. You can't beat it. If you can book a room on the club level I also high reccomend doing that. Good luck on your travels. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Luxury and a bit of peace in busy Shanghai Got this hotel on a $85 Priceline bid -- not the best deal that I've gotten on Priceline but...this hotel was so worth it and more! It was luxury as soon as you walk in through the doors. Check in was a breeze and the bellhop helped me transport my lugguage to the room. Service was superior and professional. Loved the bathrooms (separate shower and tub) and the toiletries provided. The room was spacious and the beds were fabulous with a comfy duvet. Internet access was available but it worked only on 1 night out of the 2 nights I was there. Hotel restaurant had a nice breakfast buffet. But I opted to eat off the menu instead. Really liked their Chinese breakfast. For dinner, I really liked their Hainan Chicken. Pricey meals but I was there on business and didn't really feel like wandering around Shanghai after a long day at the office. Their fitness facilities and pool were amazing! This hotel is located a bit further away in Pudong ( about a 10 minute drive away from the Shanghai hub), but taxis are really cheap so worth being out there in peace than in the noisy hub (if that's what you want). You do want to carry the hotel business card (which also has a map on it) so you can show the taxi driver where you want to go...a combination of the hotel being new and drivers not being able to speak a word of English makes this totally necessary.I'd stay at this hotel again if ever given the chance to travel to Shanghai again. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Wonderful Luxury Hotel Away From The Hustle Fantastic hotel. Stayed on the club floor for a rate of $95 over Chinese New Year - rate included breakfast buffet and evening canopes and drinks. Free internet and laundry. Room beautifully decorated with a fusion of western and eastern themes - luxurious bathroom, although tub a little on the small side!The pool, if not the gym, is amongst the most impressive I have ever seen.As highlighted by others this hotel is about 10 minutes from downtown by taxi - personally we found it nice to be away from the hustle and bustle, the hotel was really peaceful a million miles away from the honking horns of downtown (but only a £2 taxi ride each way). Genuinely amongst the finest hotels we have stayed at in the last year or so - eclipsing Century Plaza in Beverly Hills and Marriott Fort Lauderdale etc. Obviously it helps that this is a newer hotel but the service levels and quality is right up there.I would echo other comments though - few taxi drivers speak any English - it's worth getting details of the hotel name and directions in Chinese before you go! "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Definately recommend this hotel! First trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Renaissance Pudong for 3 weeks in January, it was great! Very new and well-maintained, luxurious rooms/decor, friendly staffs, nice buffets - good value for money. Concierge staffs are very helpful and professional - they deserve a thumbs-up!Located in the residential area, the area is very peaceful and not crowded - okay if you are not looking for central locations. Afterall, taxis are readily available. However, do note that hotel is quite new so many taxi drivers may not be familiar.There's also not much in the surrounding area - just a convenient store and a massage palour across the street. But Carrfour is just a 10-min taxi-ride away, great shopping place but avoid the overwhelming crowds on weekends and public holidays. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Great hotel taxi to the center Stayed in this luxurious hotel with my wife and my parents in September 2004. The hotel is great (rooms, swimming pool, sauna, gym, massage, bar) in service, yet not very centrally located. Didn't find its location to be an issue, since a taxi ride (available at hotel exit - translation services of the bellboys are very helpful &amp; necessary as taxi drivers spoke virtually no English) will cost you very little (average EUR 2) to the center. This took between between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on traffic. "
renaissance shanghai pudong ,"Very nice business hotel Very comfortable and large rooms. In a new residential area -- have to take taxi to restaurants, shopping, subway (15 min walk). "

renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Nice location nice hotel I stayed here for 2 nights. I have other 2 Renaissances in Shanghai (Yangtze &amp; Pudong) in recent past and must say this is the best of the three. The location is perfect for yuyuan Garden, bund (closed for reconstruction), Taxi base-rate ShinTenDi distance. The entrance is a small hall, where the elevator takes you to the 4th floor Lobby. This lobby is very huge and spacious; also connected is the restaurant area for breakfast- and diner-buffet. The rooms are spacious too with usual soft beds with lots of pillows; I love this style. The bathroom comes with separated shower-cabine and bathtub. The breakfast buffet assortiment is clearly more then average used to in similar hotels. One little point of critics.... I missed the shaving-kit on the room, which I assume come standard since it was in the Yangtze and in Renaissance Suzhou. Would go here next time again. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Clean and Modern Hotel If you're anal about cleanliness, this is just the hotel for you.The bathroom is just about as clean as it gets, which suits me just fine. The toiletries are great, all that's lacking are bath salts to complement the perfectly-sized tub that you can wallow in while watching tv AND enjoying the view of the Yu Yuan area from its 45degree angled windows.The bed and the different-sized pillows is so comfortable, you'd be tempted to chuck your itinerary out of the window and just stay in. It provides daily English newspapers too.The rooms are a bit pricey, so our stay would have been enhanced by free wifi.The spa and the pool are beautiful.The location is nearer the old city. perfect for Yuyuan and french concession, Bund and Nanjing Road. About 50RMB cab fare from Hongqiao Airport and 50RMB from Maglev Station in Pudong at rush hour traffic. Not much restaurants around it though, but that may change when the construction of the subway exit adjacent to it is done in 2010.What else can I say? I'd go back to this hotel the next time I'm in Shanghai. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Great place We were a little concerned about going to this hotel with the previous comments about construction work. We must learn to go to these places when the big event (expo 2010 on this occasion) and the construction work is finished. Having said that, yes there is alot of work going on around this hotel and other parts of Shanghai, but with hindsight we wouldn't have changed a thing.Located about 5-10 mins walking from Yu Yuan Bazaar &amp; Gardens, this is the old town, it is nicely located. Also about 20 mins walking to the Bund which you cannot get to because of the construction work. To see the river and the sights around the river, go to the Pudong side of the Bund. It is about 20 mins walk to People's Square, albeit, alongside the busy roads and construction site.Don't trust Taxi's, it's not that the drivers are dishonest, but they just don't seem to know where they are going. Two experiences, both of which the drivers knew where we wanted to go, helped by hotel staff, but they just couldn't find the locations, one of which was the Maglev Station &amp; the other the River Cruise terminal, hardly low key locations. And when you have a language barrier, you feel so helpless.The Maglev takes you into the outskirts of Shanghai, but it really is in no-mans land and once again in the middle of major highway works. Don't use Taxi's, I would strongly suggest using the Hotel Airport Limo service or another private hire company.The Hotel is smart, elegant, 21 floors with great Staff. We had an executive room which was a good size, modern furnishing and very comfy bed. Turn down service in the evening and probably the best executive lounge we have experienced with good breakfast good selection of 'nibbles' in the evening with lots of wine and good views. Good sized gym and 'ifinity' pool &amp; spa on the 22nd floor. If you are in an executive room you can get hotel airport limo for 25% off, worth the value. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Nice hotel next to Yuyuan hopefully the construction ends soon This hotel is very nice and modern. Right next to Yuyuan. There was some construction going on next door, which made it a bit difficult to navigate by taxi. I assume the construction will be finished soon making this a great hotel.I complained loudly to the hotel staff about the &quot;fish-smelling hot water.&quot; They upgraded my room, but the fish smell did not go away. After exploring the city for a few days, I found that the fish smell was common to water throughout the city, even in nice restaurants, so I can not blame Marriott. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"This was a fabulous hotel. We stayed at Renaissance Shanghai hotel for three nights on a China Spree Tour. This hotel is wonderful, new, trendy, rooms big enough. Rooms are nicely decorated well with a chaise, a glass topped desk. There is a large Jacuzzi, and an awesome glass infinity pool on the 22nd floor, which our boys loved at night. The view was the most awe inspiring sight at night with the city all lit up. Our breakfast is at this hotel was very delicious. Shopping in Shanghai is just 1/2 block away. We met one of the nicest local woman while shopping. She spent her entire day with us taking us to the best shops and negotiating prices for us. She refused to let me try street food and took us to a great place for dinner. What else could we ask for?The hotel is in a great location despite all the construction going on around the area but this just means it will be a whole lot nice the next time. We weren't afraid to venture out for a late evening walk. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Exceptional Hotel Location Everything about this hotel sparkled--the cleanliness, the smiles, the restaurants, the executive lounge--I can't say how much we enjoyed this hotel. The location over looking the YuYuan Bazaar was a bonus as well as the beautiful view from the roof top infinity pool. At night, the Bund sparkled outside the roof top observation deck and the executive lounge. The food in both the restaurant and the lounge was terrific for the meals we ate there (mostly breakfasts and late dinner). Originally, we stayed at the hotel as part of a China Spree package (a wonderful bonus for a package tour) but after experiencing it for two nights, we stayed 3 nights longer for about $100 per night including full breakfast-- for what I consider to be a 5 star hotel! Great value. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Great hotel and nice location for us... Our stay was during Sept 2009 and the first stop in our Asia trip and we had good experiences here. The hotel itself is very nice - the concierge / info on the main floor was very helpful, check-in was easy. Our rate did not include breakfast and we didn't opt for the upgrade. We ordered eggs off the menu for two mornings and found it to be good. The beds are hard as is everywhere in China but the showers nice and the towels plush. The rooms seem to be newly renovated and were really really good. We took a taxi to this hotel and paid 200 yuan - the hotel staff said it shouldn't be more than 160 yuan but there was a lot of traffic when we arrived. They negotiated 160 yuan for us on the way back to the airport.The location - we found this to be a great location as we liked to be able to visit the Market. When you turn right after exiting the hotel after getting on the main street, the market is less than 5 minutes away. By taxi we went to Nanjing Rd and the French Concession which cost less than $3 USD each way. I think its 11 yuan for the first 3 km and then a combination of time and km after that.Construction - yes there is a lot of it all over Shanghai and they start early - I could hear it from our hotel room (7th floor) at 4:30am and it went until almost 8pm. My spouse couldn't hear it at all for some reason so maybe I'm just a light sleeper and still getting over jet lag. Overall, would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Also, taxi's coming to this hotel from one direction couldn't turn left as there are barricades up so that added some extra time and $$ to the total.Free photocopying at the business centre (2 pgs per day) in case you need anything copied. Internet available but too expensive for us. Ate at the restaurant one night - food was just ok. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,Nice room - bad location The rooms was nice and modern. I specially liked the &quot;rain&quot;shower even tho the water had a strange smell. The location are as bad as earlier reviewer has said. Next time I will stay on a walking distance from Nanjing road. Breakfast was good reminded more of a boutique hotel then a big business hotel. 
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Nearly flawless First, lobby was beautiful, the front desk was always welcoming and eager to help and spoke English well, as did the staff in the Executive level lounge. The room was fun, funky, very functional, comfortable and uber modern! The rooftop indoor infinity pool was beautiful, and the fitness room new, modern, well equipped, and far better than most hotels in this category and price range. Also on the roof level was a beautiful, well staffed full spa, priced way above the local spas around central Shanghai, but well below comparable services in the U.S. I had a better than &quot;OK&quot; massage and spa experience, which is better than I heard from many other travelers I met throughout the city during the course of my ten day stay. In addition I should add that as a Platinum Elite member I had free access to the Executive Club lounge that was open from early to late, had spectacular views of both the old town as well as the magnificent Pudong Skyline, provided complimentary drinks, coffee, and a variety of teas most of the day, and served a delicious light breakfast buffet and evening Hors D'Oeuvres followed by a later pastry bar. Ah life was good! Wireless Internet access in the lounge was free for invited lounge guests, but was rather pricey for access in the guest rooms. Free guest room Internet access is very important to me, so this would be only major criticism of the hotel for convenience and value. I did NOT try any of the restaurants, so cannot comment. The location is great for exploring by foot and shopping in Nanshi (the Old Town - and with all the rebuilding going on, there will not be much authentic old town left soon), as well as the beautiful YuYuan Gardens, the hotel's namesake. Now for the less the less than flawless review. Access to the rest of the major tourist and business destinations requires a very inexpensive cab ride, but since the hotel entrance is off the street, few passing cabs bother to pull in front of the hotel entrance unless discharging passengers, and a short wait should almost always expected. (I was told up to 20 minutes, but actually never waited more than 10 minutes). The bus stop is about a 5-10 minute walk through a construction zone where for 2RNY (about $0.30) you can hitch a ride all the way to People's Square. I am a walker, and at a good pace it takes a good 25 minutes to navigate through the construction to the eastern entrance to the Nanjing Pedestrian Mall or the Bund (which is currently not worth exploring until at least mid 2010 as it is a nighmarish dust-filled &quot;walk at your own peril&quot; construction site). When the new metro line and nearby metro stop is completed, and given the property's proximity to the massive 2010 World Expo site, I expect this hotel's occupancy and popularity to soar. But for now, even with the inconveniences, I would happily stay at the Renaissance Shanghai Yuyuan Hotel again. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"I was happy enough here. It was a clean hotel. The location is a bit bad at the moment but they are building a metro right outside it now so that should be a huge help to the hotel in 2010. The room was excellent. Value for money, yeah, i was happy enough. The service. well, i found it ok at the time of staying there but when i went to Shanghai airport and found that the customs officers were friendlier than the hotel staff i began to wonder. In fairness the staff on the bottom floor ( when you walk into the hotel) were fantastic, but once you went up ( the reception was up on the next floor) the staff were less friendly. My review might seem a bit bad but i should point out that i was in The Marriott City Wall Beijing a few days before that ( my review is in here) and this place was a few notches down on the Marriott. So maybe i was getting to grand in myself. But i would still recommend this place. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Cheater I reserved a room on their website. However, when I went, they told me that the rate does not include breakfast and they tried to sell me an upgrade to include breakfast. My advice to travelers is to use Hotels.com or other website instead of the website of the hotel. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Great hotel but didnt like the food I liked the most: fitness center, swimming pool, sauna, all are on the top floor with a view of Shanghai...amazing; good location- very close to Yu Garden and shopping district; spacious trendy rooms I dissliked: food "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"too much marketing The hotel offers basically what you expect from such a place. Little bad that there are too many merchandisers offering restaurants in the lobby. Wireless is only available together with an overall upgrade. The upgrade as such is not worth is, since the according lounge you get access to is basically a boaring and not particulary convenient place. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Wonderful hotel disappointing food My husband and I booked our Shanghai package at a very good price through our local airline. Their prices were unusually reasonable for a 5-star rated hotel. The hotel is located very near the Yu Gardens where you can buy Chinese trinkets, souveniers, etc. Checking-in the hotel was quick and easy. Concierge staff were very professional, warm, and spoke fluent English. The woman that checked us in, personally accompanied us to the elevator all the way up to our floor. Our luggage arrived at the same time we did and the bell hop accompanied us to our room. While he was very nice and pleasant, he simply unloaded our luggages and asked if everything was alright. When we said yes, he simply bid us a good night, turned around and left. We were a little surprised he did not orient us with the workings of the switches of the room (a/c, lights) and use of water in the bathrooms....but that's alright, probably thought we were intelligent engough to figure things out.We requested for a room with a view on a high floor. We were given the 15th floor with a sideview of the Yu Garden and Henan Road. Despite this, one couldn't just ignore the HUGE eyesore of a construction of what is to be a mall. Other than that, we loved our room. The room looked exactly as the photo in the hotel's website. We loved the huge, firm bed with multiple down feather pillows and silk filled covers. We loved the glass walled bathroom. I really liked the automatic blinds which is controlled nside the bathroom near the tub. It's a good idea for one to be able to watch tv while relaxing in a hot tub and not just hear the tv.One of the best things that we look forward to when my hubby and I vacation is the buffet breakfast. Breakfast at the Yu Garden Cafe had a good spread but didn't have any variety. I was quite surprised that in our 5night/6day stay, our breakfast was EXACTLY THE SAME ALWAYS--from the juices, fruits, cold station, breads, egg station, hot staton--pancakes/waffle, oatmeal, dimsum, japanese, noodle, and congee stations. I couldn't understand how they only served breakfast potatoes as roasted baby potatoes every morning. What happened to hash browns, lyonnaise, roesti, tortas, etc? Everyday we had bacon &amp; chicken sausage only in the hot station. Flavor-wise, I've had better tasting breakfast in 4-star hotels. I felt the breakfast buffet variety was very limited for a 5-star rated hotel. We did like the baked breads---delicious cinnamon rolls, croissants, apple strudel, etc. Service during breakfast was hit &amp; miss. One of the odd things I noticed was that after you sign up for breakfast before entering the restaurant, you are not escorted to a table. Instead, you would choose your own table. If the dining room happened to be empty, it would be easy to spot a table. However if the dining room was full, my husband and I stood in the middle of the room looking around us and not 1 service staff approached to assist us. Finally, we called the attention of the receptionist to tell her there were no tables available. She was quite surprised by this news, so she walked ahead of me and went straight to one of the 2 tables joined together to form a 4-5 top (already occupied with 2 steaming cups of coffee) and separated them and then pointing to us, this was to be our table. Sometimes, we would encounter a very efficient waitress who would offer us coffee/tea; other times, we would only be served if we asked for it. Most of the time, they were very efficient in removing dirty plates, flatware, and empty glasses. Although, some had a habit of removing plates without asking first. I had just finished my bread and when I had put aside my flatware, one waitress just bussed my plate with the flatware without asking. I had just barely been in the restaurant for 7 minutes at the time. I had to ask for a new replacement setting. Service staff would probably need some form of refresher training course.On our 4th night at the hotel, we chose to eat in the Yu Garden Cafe after a long day of shopping. I thought this would be a great chance to actually review the food based on a la carte dining. My husband and I both ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice at a reasonable RMB78+. We were given a delicious wood-fired flat bread from the oven served with a lovely duo of butter and pickled black beans. The pickled black beans were yummy. When the Hainanese Chicken came it was to be a HUGE disappointment. The chicken was dry, the soup was tasteless (no hint of salt or ginger) with 2 4-inch pcs of chives (unchopped) and chiffonade of cabbage. For some reason they caramelized the onions in the rice; so it came in a bowl with brown-colored rice. While sweet, caramelized onions are delicious in other dishes, it did not go well with the Hainanese chicken rice as it overpowered the flavor of the chicken. It spoiled the subtle flavor of the dish. In the end, the rice tasted closer to a Vietnamese dish.But one great surprise that the Renaissance did was sending me a beautiful &amp; delicious raspberry-chocolate mousse birthday cake to my hotel room. Now that gesture just shows you why the Renaissance Shanghai Yuyuan is rated 5-star. Excellent customer service will always be the deciding factor whether one would be a loyal, returning customer or not. We surely would. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Excellent hotel We had booked this hotel for only one night because their staff spoke great English and could assist us with buying train tickets. However, from the moment we arrived, we loved it so much that we cancelled our reservations at a less expensive hotel for 2 nights and booked Renaissance instead. The hotel is nothing but luxurious with a smell fresh flowers everywhere. Rooms are very modern, elegant and comfortable. The first room we had was on the 16th floor with one wall being glass from floor to ceiling. We had a marvelous view of Pudong skyscrapers and streets. The shower is one of the best features of this hotel and this becomes very important if you do any walking in the city as it is very dusty. The shower head is very large and makes you feel like you're standing in the rain. The bed is somewhat firm like all chinese beds, but quite comfortable. The hotel is expensive when booked through Marriott or other online travel sources. However, we got a travel agency in Beijing to book it for us and we got it for around $110 per night, not including breakfast. Location is also good if you want to stay in Shanghai rather than Pudong. It's about a 30 minute walk from the bund, but the Bund is very overrated and almost not even worth seeing at this time. There is tons of construction going on and walls are up everywhere, making it impossible to look across the river to Pudong. There is dust everywhere and no sidewalks because of the construction, making walking in the roads with cars quite uncomfortable. So it is really not worth staying closer to the bund until all the construction is complete. Renaissance is just a 5-minute walk from the Yuyuan garden and other touristy areas as well as shopping. The only down side to the location is that to get anywhere, you have to walk by bunch of local shops and vendors who usually do an excellent job at harassing tourists to buy their stuff. The key is not to make any eye contact and keep walking. Another great feature of the hotel is the pool. It's on the 21st floor and the entire wall of the room is made of glass. You can sit in the hot tub at night next to the pool and see the lit up city in front of you. However, the water in the pool is not heated. There are several restaurants at the hotel but most of them are very expensive. There is also an attached bakery which has decent prices. If I ever go back to Shanghai, this hotel is definately where I will stay. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Swim in the sky Stayed in the hotel for three nights on a China Spree Tour. There is construction right out the door of the hotel and for that matter everywhere in Shanghai. They have torn down the wonderful walking promenade of the Bund. There is no Bund to get ready for the World Expo in 2010. This hotel is lovely. Rooms are decorated well with a chaise, blinds into the bathroom which operate on an electric switch, no free internet, but a lovely glass topped workstation. There is a glass infinity pool on the 22nd floor. You feel like you are swimming in the sky when you swim to the end which is over the city. There is also a large jacuzzi. You can see the whole city from this pool area, loungers to sit or lie down. Breakfast is delicious. I asked at the front desk what a room would cost if I walked in the door. Price was $225 + 15 % tax and no breakfast. The very best shopping in Shanghai is just 1/2 block away and also a place where Chinese people go to temples, eat, etc. The shopping area is about 10 blocks long and wide with tea houses on a small lagoon. You are also about a 5 minute cab ride to the waterfront so you can take a 45 minute cruise on the waterway to see the night lights. The location of this hotel is great and by next year it will cost much more. This is truly a 5 star hotel (art is by the glass artist Chiluly (sp)). "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Budget 5-Star Hotel in 2009 only!~ Due to the promotional price (just HKD500/rm/n), we decided to staying at Renaissance Yuyuan Shanghai for two nights during the late May.We booked it months ago and see every comments here are good and I have visit here again a few days prior to my trip. I finally know why the 5-Star hotel can offer the room rate as cheap as the 3-Star hotel. As the Expo 2010 will be hold in Shanghai next year, there are constructions all around the city. Even the hotel area.... (The New Subway Line to be set up soon and the Yuyuan Station is just next to the hotel) you can find dust and stone covered on your shoes all the time. And it is easy to visit the Yu Garden in walking distance and no need to walk across the road but for 15min walk or above, I will highly recommend to take the Taxi!~Thankfully, we just staying there for 2 nights and honestly, it is a quite good hotel. The ground floor is the Concerige desk and the bakery. Hotel lobby is located in the 4th floor, the staffs there are helpful and they will provide what you need if you request. My room is big but the decoration is not really good, maybe it is located just right to the elevator. The bathroom with separate bathtub and rainforest shower which every 5-star hotel have. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Welcome to a hotel that does it right My associate and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while on business in Shanghai. The hotel is new and is maintained in spotless condition. Hotel staff is not just attentive, but anxious to assist and to provide service. We stayed in a club level room and I would recommend that option. The club lounge is open 18 hours a days, providing a comfortable area for work and relaxation both. Breakfast is served daily in this room and is preparted nicely, with many choices. Coffee, tea, desserts and all beverages are available and a happy hour offers beer, wine and cocktails. The rooms were spacious, well appointed and perfectly clean. Beds were comfortable, linens nice and plenty of pillows. English is spoken by almost all employees in customer service jobs. The restaurants in the hotel are good and leaving the hotel to eat is not necessary. There is construction in the area, but we did not find noise to be an issue at all. The only problem we encountered was planning the direction to return to the hotel, because turning into the hotel from one direction was permitted and the not was not due to the construction. This resulted in a 6-8 block detour which in Shanghai traffic is no small issue.This was a great stay in a fine hotel and I would recommend consideration for this hotel unless your business was confined to the financial area in which case there could be a comparabel hotel in a location more specifically accesptabe for you. In my case the location was not an issue and what I wanted and got was a clean comfortable hotel where I could spend five days without feeling trapped. The service and amenities provided that for me "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Mixed Feelings About This Hotel... ...this is a slightly belated review of my experience with the Shanghai YuYuan Renaissance. I am agreeing with many reviewers' opinions, and the only fair way to assess this hotel is to separate its location from the establishment.Let's talk first about the hotel itself: beautiful new building, spacious lobby, plushy bed, tasty breakfast buffet (which was included with my stay), fantastic bath products and shower. I was lucky enough to get a corner room with a view of the PuXi skyscrapers. The YuYuan Renaissance seems to attract more business travelers, since I barely saw couples or families during my stay (but instead lots of men in suits). And now for the rub: the location sucks. There's no way around this one. If you prefer to be surrounded by hip boutiques, local cafes, and cool nightlife...this is definitely not the hotel you should be booking. Yu Yuan is considered &quot;Old Town&quot; Shanghai and is basically a tourist trap. If you like to visit cheesy Chinese tchachki stores and sample local snacks shops, there are literally hundreds of them around the Renaissance. Oh, and all the gripe about the subway construction in front of the hotel is true -- let's just say that my cab driver couldn't even drop me off the hotel front door one day due to construction. He had to pull over a block away, and I trekked through the flooded street back to the hotel front door. Ugh. So if you find a great room deal through a travel Web site and don't mind the various inconveniences every reviewer has mentioned...go for it. Otherwise, try to avoid this hotel until the construction is finally finished. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Average experience After reading so many good reviews here, i decided to go ahead and book this hotel without consulting any of my friends who are based in shanghai. it was a mistake. My friends later told me that anyone who are familiar with shanghai will not book a hotel in this area. Construction work was everywhere near the hotel. It was dusty and very dirty! Traffic was a big problem because it was relatively hard to get a cab and even when we got one, the roads around the hotel were always jammed. This put us off so much.. we hardly go out. It was even more unadvisible to go on foot because it just made me feel like i had to walk through a sand storm and crazy traffic. The taxi even refused to send us back to the hotel lobby a few times because they did not want to make a u turn and get jammed up in the traffic. We were dropped at the opposite side of the road and have to jay walk through the chaos.Besides the condition around the hotel, the location of the hotel was exactly like what the name says-Its less than 5 mins away from Yu Yuan. Great if you're on a sightseeing trip. We managed to escape the long queue for the famous Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao because we got there at its opening time since we lived so near. It was near the Bund and other famous sightseeing attractions. The rooms were nicely decorated with the see through bathroom. It seems to be one of the very popular bathroom designs among new hotels. Rooms were abit small for shanghai hotels. This is based on the comparison of other hotels i've stayed in shanghai. There's free WIFI in the lobby but no one inform me. i found out by accident. I was only informed about the paying wifi in the business centre and in the room. Hm.Hotel staffs were mostly very friendly and courteous! The staffs in the restaurant where we had breakfast every morning could remember exactly our favourite table, choice of beverages..etc. It's nice to know that the staffs actually remember such teeny details! Conciere was very helpful. Gave us clear directions and accurate estimations to the places we wanted to go. However there was this guy on evening shift at the reception who was quite hostile. He behaved like he was just going through a procedure that he was obligated rather than providing us a proper service.Spa was nice but expensive. The spa has top to bottom glass window. It has a nice view of the big city. However, one can easily find nice and cheap massage all around shanghai. I went to one which has very nice ambience, free flow of food and drinks, dvd player in the room and was only a fraction of the price in the hotel!On the overall, it was a nice hotel with nice people but i dont think i will come back again. Not unless they are done with the construction or they have special promotions. Full price-no thanks. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Service and Luxury I have stayed several times at this hotel in Shanghai. It is relatively new (less than 2 years old) and is a pleasure to visit. The staff is exceptional and work very hard to make you feel welcome and taken care of. The rooms are large and luxurious with great workstations including ports to attach your computer to the HD TV via both video and audio. The beds are awesome.If you are Platinum at Marriott the lounge is exceptional. Large, comfortable and great service. I have stayed there 4 or 5 times and they remember me each time and even try to give me the same room. A nice touch. Upstairs in the lounge there is even a great TV room to watch DVDs.This is also in a good location since you can easily walk to YuYuan Garden, a tourist place with good restaurants and shopping. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,Great location and service Appreciated extra help given in confirming our next hotel in China and our phone messages were also given in written format. Concierge wrote all of our destinations in Chinese for the taxi drivers. This was a real plus in China where so few speak English. Room was delightfully modern and clean. We ate at the breakfast buffet which was a little spendy but delicious and included tax and service. 
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Top class hotel with unfortunate building work I stayed here on a RTW trip for three nights in July 08 spending my Marriot Points.Becuase of my Marriot status we got the 5 star treatment, upgraded etc. The room on the club florr was wonderful, everything you could want. Being on that floor got me access to the club lounge which had free internet, and then free nibbles between 5 and 7 and then free deserts between 7 and 9 (I think) During these 4 hours they also offer free drinks- limited selection but more than enough, we ensconsed ourselves here one evening, did some planning reading etc and demolised two bottles of very welcome white wine (Californian).The pool is amazing - glass sided and looking out over the city.The service we experianced was first class and they booked us tickets to the acobats and also looked after our luggage while we were away for the day in Hangzhou.Breakfast was amazing, all sorts of options.The only downside is the rather chaotic roadworks and construction next door, which means that taxi access is a little tricky and some rooms will have a dud view.I cannot fault the hotel really but then I did get a upgrade etc. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Good bed excellent breakfast area (and view if wrong room) a building site We stayed in the hotel during a one night stopover in Shanghai. To be fair, this was by far the best value deal I could find on the various hotel web-sites. However when we arrived we understood why! We had walked from the metro station (it looked close on the map, but it wasn't), and arrived quite wet. The porters barely took an interest in us and directed us to reception on the 4th floor, without offering to look after our luggage.I had booked a 'cityview' room. The we were given had a view over... the huge (I mean huge) building site next door, cranes, and general chaos. We went back to reception and asked to change. We were told that these were the rooms that were given with that rate. I insisted for a room change and we were given a very nice (but smaller) room with an excellent view over the Yuyan 'model' historic buildings and the Pudong skyscrapers. The bathroom only had a shower, so I think it was in fact a downgrade, but the location was much better that the first room we were offered.The bathroom floor was marble and very, very cold.The bed was very much Marriott standard. Excellent, firm and cosy, with down pillows.Breakfast was surprise. It was truly excellent, with great choice and good quality stuff. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Incredible hotel This was a great hotel with a fantastic location for shopping at the Yu Gardens, but not so great for business. There was construction all around and it was difficult for taxis/cars to navigate. Also, there are no subways anywhere nearby. BUT, if you came to shop and sightsee and relax, the pool is wonderful, exercise equipment is awesome,, and the rooms were quite high tech. I could plug my laptop into an adapter at the desk and watch movies on the flat screen panel TV. Pretty cool. The breakfast was fantastic, too. Nothing left to be desired. You go out the front door, walk 100 yards down a neat alley with local color, and you're at the Yu Gardens complex. Remember to shop around the periphery of the area for the best deals! "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,Great Hotel Stayed in the Renaissance (a Marriott property) for 4 nights in early November. The hotel is only 16 months old and in great shape.The only downside is they are doing construction in front of the hotel so it is a mess. I would not let that stop you from staying at this beautiful hotel.Check in was easy. We asked to upgrade and they upgraded us the the club floor (but not club floor benefits). The price we paid was about 175.00 per night including 2 breakfasts ( think the breakfast was 27.00 per person) which was well worth it. Full American and full Chinese fare. The staff spoke very good English and the doormen made sure we knew where we were going and the taxi driver understood the price because the doorman told us how much the ride should be. Very few rides were more then 3 - 5 dollarsWe had a corner room on the 18th floor. The view to Pudong showed al the new construction and we forgot the street mess once we were in the room.We had a very nice stay and would stay again. When we left it was raining and the doorman gave us a new hotel umbrella to stay dry. 
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Good but not great I needed to return to Shanghai for my return flight to the USA. I stayed at the Renaissance for one day so admitedly I did not sample all this hotel has to offer but I did get a chance to walk the area i.e. the Bund and nearby Yuyuan Garden flea markets. The bottom line on this hotel is that this will be a great location to visit Shanghai in about 2 years when construction of the metro stop next door is completed for the 2010 Intl. Expo. Right now it is not ideal because the streets are cut up in and around the hotel forcing you to walk in some unsavory looking areas on your way to the Bund. Although I paid full price for a deluxe room, this did not get me the best Pudong views available at this hotel. Instead my view was of the construction pit below however the skyline view at night from my 12th floor room of the Yuyuan garden market was very nice indeed.The service quality at this hotel is impeccable. I stayed at four different hotels during my recent trip to China and believe me there are service issues at some hotels particularly , the front desk area. This hotel was the only one I felt that valued me as a client.The hotel is recently constructed and therefore the rooms are pristine , elegant with all the modern conveniences and amenities especially the spacious bathroom with the soaking tub and seperate shower. Loved the wide screen TV with all the right channels.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the breakfast is a bit pricey at this hotel if not already included in the price. $30 for breakfast is stratospheric in China. In fact, I would only recommend staying at this hotel if you get a promotional price of $150 or less with breakfast included. You will feel gouged otherwise considering the construction inconvenience in and around this hotel. Also, watch out for the taxi drivers laying in wait for unsuspecting tourists who will charge you double the rate to the airport. These are the guys who will take you at break neck speed weaving in and out of traffic to the airport and try to charge you $50 for the Disney ride adventure. Luckily we were forewarned by the hotel and paid half. My cardiologist will get the other half. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Almost Perfect The hotel is located centrally, right next to YuYuan and within walking distance to the Bund. The rooms feature floor to ceiling windows offering views of the city (we could see Pudong from ours) and modern, attractive furnishings. The bathroom was massive and gleaming, with separate tub and shower. There is a gym/spa on the top floor (21), including the Infinity Pool - an all-glass pool next to the glass windows (incredible!). The lounge for elite members featured great views of Pudong as well, although the food selection was not as impressive as I've seen at other Marriott/Renaissance properties. The one drawback we experienced involved taxis - we waited for 30 minutes on a Sunday night when leaving for dinner, and also found many drivers didn't know where the hotel was or had trouble finding the way to the dropoff at the hotel's entrance. Overall a fantastic stay! "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"One of the best in Shanghai I stay in Shanghai often and I have stayed at all of the Marriott brands in the city. This one is my favorite. The hotel is new and clean and nice. The breakfast was amazing, however it was VERY expensive, so was the internet. Those were my only complaints. The bathroom was every bit of a 5 star and my standards are quite high. You can't go wrong with this hotel. The location is ideal for getting just about anywhere in Shanghai except you have to rely on taxis because it is not close to the metro. The price for the room is fair for what you get. I plan to stay here again and highly recommended it to everyone. Again, I stay in A LOT of hotels in Asia, China and Shanghai so I have a very good comparison... "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Great location modern new and FANTASTIC views! We enjoyed four nights at the Renaissance. Our room had an incredible view of Pudong and the beautiful Shanghai skyline! The room was beautiful, the staff was extremely helpful and the location was very central to the Old Town, Yuyuan Gardens, Pudong, and the Bund. I would highly recommend this hotel. Our only complaint was the restaurant was a bit expensive. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Wish the location could be better I agree with the previous reviewer that this hotel is good but not great.The location is both good and bad. The good thing is it is located in the center of Shanghai. So pretty much every other attraction is very close by.The bad thing is that this hotel is located in a rather run-down, old section of Shanghai. Out of the windows, you will be able to see both spectaculer modern buildings and slums at the same time. (Construction is going on, so it is possible that at some point, the slums will be completely demolished.)I agree with the previous reviewer that this hotel is good but not great.The location is both good and bad.

Out of the windows, you will be able to see both spectacular modern buildings and slums at the same time. (Construction is going on, so it is possible that at some point, the slums will be completely demolished.)The hotel service is good, although I was cheated one time by the taxi driver who was waiting outside the hotel and obviously was quite familiar with the bell hops. I was over charged by the taxi drive by about 50% (confirmed by locals and other taxi drivers later). When I asked for a receipt, the taxi drive refused. I later learned that you can refuse to pay if no receipt can be given.The hotel is very new and very clean. The gym is pretty small but decent. The pool has a great view on the top of the building. The breakfast buffet is very nice and costs about RMB190 (Approximately $27.5 based on the current exchange rate). Not cheap, but it has great varieties.I will probably stay at another hotel close to the People's Square next time or stay in Pu Dong (Pu Dong is the business district on the East side of the Huang Pu River. You do need to travel to Pu Xi to visit many of Shanghai’s attractions if you stay in Pu Dong. But Pu Dong is so much cleaner). "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"We loved the staff The subway construction allowed us to get bargain rates with the fancy buffet breakfast. We stayed for a week and loved the room, (we were upgraded to one with a soaking tub in front of a huge window overlooking the city because the first room was too hot.). The staff was more than terrific, perhaps because the hotel was new and maybe underbooked, so they were willing to spend time with us, help us with our baby Chinese, tell us about themselves. Almost all of them had trained in other countries, one manager was from Germany, and their English was astonishingly good (not perfect, but remember we are trying to learn Chinese). Being near the Yu Yuan was fun because of the crowds. When the subway is finished (Line 8, which I think is open now, although I'm not sure the hotel's stop is finished), and the plans for an art gallery on the first floor are realized, the hotel will be great. But then we won't get the bargain rates.Drawbacks: We ate too much at the breakfasts. The chandelier in the lobby and the carpeting are really over the top in kitschy-ness. Also we actually missed some of staff when we left. We only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the outside construction. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Good but not great First, there is a huge construction project going on around this hotel and it will continue for years. There are some highlights like the pool area on the top floor where you can see for miles and this is nice at night. People go there for the night time view. The location is right next to a large market (Old Town) where you can buy (and eat) anything. It is an easy walk to the Yu Yaun Gardens and to the riverfront Bund. In China the taxis are so cheap that as long as you are in the same city exact location matters very little. A $3 cab fare is big (except to the airport). Watch for airport taxi scam when you arrive. Go only to the offical taxi stand on the ground floor outside bagge claim. Do NOT be fooled by someone who looks official but wants you to go to a different floor. Taxi fare from airport to city is about 150 CNY ($20). If you fall for the scam you will pay $60 or more. Shanghai is a wonderful city and this hotel is fine. There is better but will cost you alot more. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Surprisingly good I booked this hotel because it is close to the residence of my brother. Lodging experience is surprisingly good.1. Brand new, modern, spacious and tidy room2. Good breakfast: Lots of choice and quality food3. Friendly staff 4. Just 5 minutes walk to the famous yuyuan. Very convenient to go to Xin Tin Di and other attractions.A nice hotel worthing my recommendation. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,Great room good location helpful staff Stayed here in mid march for 3 nights followed by 1 night at the Grand Hyatt Pudong. If you're in shanghai for holiday i would definitely suggest the renaissance.Roomrooms are clean and 5 star quality Concierge good English and helpful - know where you want to go as they will mostly suggest western restaurants. For some good suggestions check out: http://www.danwashburn.com/clips/budgettravel/BudgetTravelMyShanghaiIsBetterThanYours.pdfLocation5min walk to old town and 15min in a cab anywhere else you would want to goOverall best bet for leisure traveler in shanghai - maybe stay at the Hyatt one night for the novelty of it but if you want to be close to everything with a nice room stay at the renaissanceadded extraif you have an extra few days and want to check out Beijing take the express train - leave at 730PM arrive at 730AM and about 70USD per person for a soft sleeper room 
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Wow!! Very impressed with the hotel Wow!!! This was an awesome hotel. I loved the modern décor of the common areas and the hotel rooms. The only thing was the color of the rug – it’s very bright and doesn’t really go well with everything. I read the review about how small the size of the rooms were – I completely disagree. The rooms were ample-sized and it was a very nice place to stay at, especially staying at a smaller hotel in Beijing prior. It’s definitely comparable or if not better than any of the 4-5 star hotels in the U.S. The gym was also great. It’s on the 20-something floor and had a great view of the city. They also provide towels and water bottles for every aerobics machine. The location was awesome. It was right in the middle of YuYuan and walking distance to Nanjing Road (about 15 minutes), Old Shanghai and the Bund. I had no problems getting cabs whenever I needed one, even during a rainy day when I left Shanghai. I do have to say that the taxi drivers are still somewhat unfamiliar with where the hotel is located and didn’t take us to the correct location a few times. Overall, I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff went out of their way to be accommodating and most of them spoke fluent English, which makes it much easier. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Hotel Very Nice but Don't Count on the Airport Transfer Our 3-night accommodation at Renaissance Yuyuan was booked as a package with Dragonair as they were in some sort of promotional partnership. Included in the package were free airport transfers operated by the hotel exclusively for KA passengers. However, only upon our arrival at the Pudong Airport we realised that the transfer was not operated frequently like on hourly basis but run only every 4 hours or so (or whenever there's enough hotel guests on that particular KA flight). Bemused, and instead of waiting for 3 hours at the airport with all the luggages we joined another couple who was in the same situation to take a taxi to the hotel. (Here I'd rather skip the details of our incredible taxi journey, in which the 4 of us ended up being abandoned at an outskirt subway station. That's enough of a bad start for a holiday already.)During check-in we asked the reception lady if we need to book the transfer for our return flight just to play safe. She answered that all would be arranged and the concierge should inform us the arrangement the night before departure. But this didn't happen. We approached the reception in the morning before breakfast and were told that either we should catch the bus due to depart in 20 minutes, or the next departure would be too late for our flight. Again, we had to take a cab to the airport and experienced another horrendous 70-minutes ride.We understand that the transfer service was meant to be complimentary but it'd be nice if we could be informed of the schedule in advance, and get prepared if we need to find other means of transport.Apart from the transfer incubus the hotel itself was actually very nice as per other reviews. Clean and modern room, courteous staff, adequate breakfast (better have early breakfast on Sunday as they'd start relocating guests to the lobby lounge starting from 10:00am to make space for the brunch), great spa (discounts on offer), swimming pool and some rooms with nice view of the city, etc. Downsides were the long distance from subway station, surrounding traffic congestion and construction work (but where you can escape from these in downtown SH?!). Overall it's still good value for money. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"New hotel decent value and location. This hotel is great because it is all new and a modern (if a bit bright) style. The location is just south of the Bund and a quick cab drive from all the action. My room had a great view. The gym is poor, but the breakfast buffet is great. There was hardly anyone at the hotel while I was there. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Fantastic We have just returned from China and wish to share our experience at this hotel. First we booked everything on line on the Marriott website. We were able to cancel up to 24hrs prior if need be. One week before our arrival I received and email from them confirming my booking to which I replied in the affirmative with an extra request. We wanted to travel by sleeper train from Shanghai to Beijing at the end of our stay. The concierge staff replied letting us know that they were able to book the train for us with a small fee and pay when we arrieved. This made it extremely easy for us since we had trouble trying to organise train tickets ourselves. We bought 4 tickets @ $80AUD each. Since there were 3 of us we wanted the whole cabin to ourselves thus 4 tickets.We felt The Hotel location was perfect for us since we wanted to experience as much as possible the real China. There was underground railway works going on outside but it never bothered us. The hotel happened to be located around the corner from old Shanghai town. It's a town with it's original buildings all in tact. (The hotel website add indicating a tall modern building on top of an old Chinese one is misleading. The old building is a picture of Old China Town around the corner away from the hotel altogether). There is plenty of shopping and fantastic bargains there, especially if you are good at haggling. e.g. A Rolex watch was offered to me at a discount price for 1200CNY I got it for 100CNY $17AUD but not in the shops. No.1 rule haggle for everything and have small notes to give the right money because you may get handed counterfeit bills. Westerners are fair game so never buy from people approaching you from the street.Back to the hotel: Upon arrival we had a very efficient check in with very friendly staff and when our bags were brought to our room the porter showed us the room facilities. The rooms are very well appointed and they all have diamond shaped bay window which allows one to have 220 Deg views. We were on the 15th floor and the views were fantastic and able to view the famous ball tower in the distance. You will be asked if you want a high or lower floor. Higher floor are quieter. The bathroom facilities are western style and extremely well appointed and exceptionally clean. We were 3 people in the room which had 2 very comfortable double beds. There was a flat screen TV with 3 of 40 stations offering English movies free of charge. CNN and BBC were also showing 24hrs daily. We made very good use of the small safe in the room. Overall it was very comfortable and spacious for us. We paid in total $1400AUD for 3 people for 7nights.Breakfast that's offered from 6.am till 11am. is both Asian and Western Buffet and included in the room price. There were 2 hot food kitchens one each for Asian and Western with chefs on hand to cook up what you like. The staff service was exceptional, obsequious and very quick to serve your needs. Do not tip anyone there. Most if not all staff spoke a better than average English. There are internet and general office facilities available on the 3rd floor for a fee. As well as in room internet if you have a laptop. The lobby is fantastic and includes a bar.Use taxis to go everywhere because they are very cheap and make sure it is a 2 toned one with a meter. Only these ones are legitimate. We had no problems with any of them. When you board a taxi at the hotel the staff ask you your destination and they write it down for you in Chinese and show the driver. They also give you the Taxi license plate no. in case of trouble which the hotel staff will follow up with the cab Co. The Consiege also sell local Mobile phone sim cards. Make sure you get one which covers all China not just Shanghai if you intend to move out of Shanghai. There is very well appointed gym upstairs on the 31st floor which has a few weight machines, treadmills, cross trainer machines, lockers and showers in the dressing rooms. Each machine has a sweat towel provided and a water bottle for your use. All complimentary. There is also a 20mtr lap pool next to the gym. Across the other side of this wing are health a beauty facilities which include facials, massage, spas with friendly staff all for a fee. My wife had a facial for 500CNY. There are a range of different prices to choose from.Overall we were very pleased with this Hotel and will always recommend it to anyone. After a day out haggling and negotiating the chaos of the traffic it felt like a sanctuary coming back to the hotel. I personally will not stay anywhere else in Shanghai if I can help it. If you want luxury and all Western requirement catered for then this is the place to stay.Excellent for business people, couples, honeymooners and families with teenage kids. The service is impecable. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Good Value 5 Star Hotel. The checkin to checkout my experience was a good one.I gave it one less star than full marks simply because of the surrounding traffic. There is ALOT of construction going around this hotel for the new subway lines. Probably why I got it so cheap. PriceStayed 4 nights@103USD including breakfast. I booked with Asia Rooms. My original online booking did not include breakfast but I was just given the breakfast for two option. It was nice surprise.I think I have uploaded enough pictures so you will have a basic idea what the hotel looks like. Unfortunately the quality is not so great since I was using my mobile phone to take the photos. Where to start?BuildingThe hotel is very new. The hotel had just opened 3 months.The lobby was located on the 4th floor. The concierge on the 1st floor. Interesting arrangement. Some building space outside of the hotel but within the hotel building on the first floor presumably for future stores still had construction going on. Inside everything was complete. Pity I didn't take any pictures of the inside of the hotel. Very clean!Location5 minute walk to YU GARDENS and 15 MINUTE walk to the BUND. 20 minute walk to the nearest subway line Central Henan Road (Green line No.2). The hotel is still too new so some taxi drivers had a hard time locating the hotel. It is easier to say go to the YU GARDENS and then just walk to the hotel. The surrounding street is going through major construction. I don't hear any of it but I felt the effects. Lots of traffic! Once in a taxi I didn't take too long to go to the interesting places like Shanghai Center, Tongren Lu, Nanjing West Road, Nanjing East Road, Remin Square, Xin Tian Di, French Concession, BUND, PUDONG....ReceptionThe receptionists spoke adequate English although it was suprising that their level was not more polished. Checkin was efficient. Friendly.RoomsStayed in a very modern and clean looking twin bed deluxe with a view of the BUND. Large comfy double beds each with 4 fluffy pillows and a bolster. The carpet was plush blue material. Very powerful A/C. Too powerful in fact when turned on all night it made the room very dry. So dry I woke up every morning with a sore throat. Tasteful pictures on the wall. Flat screen TV. There were two large sofa style chairs and adequately sized glass study table. Inroom safe available, large closet with several hangers, an iron, fully stocked mini bar, individual halogen reading lights near each bed and a very nice looking alarm clock I wanted to take with me but resisted the urge. Received a daily newspaper.Bell / Valet ServiceMost of the bell boys knew English as well as the valets. They would write down the taxi's license plate and give it to you each time so you could always keep track of the taxi you rode if you encounter any trouble.BathroomA wonderful bathroom with a glass wall. To ensure privacy the glass wall had blinds on them that could be automatically lowered and raised at a touch of a button. The shower was fully enclosed. A moderately sized bathtub, a hair dryer, lots of towels of all sizes and high quality shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, ETC. (I took a lot of these back with me!!)F &amp; BDidn't try the room service. Didn't try the bars or the food there EXCEPT the breakfast! It was better than most hotel breakfast lineups I have been too. The overall layout was an open space designed cafe theme. It felt like an unattended deli where you could walk behind the counter or fridge and take anything you wanted. Instead of pouring your juice out of a container you simply take small individual bottles of your choice of juice. Food was quite tasty. I have never been diappointed when I ate breakfast at a Renaisance hotel. The Shangri La still is my favorite though. Servers were very prompt at clearing my dishes. Friendly.FacilitiesBusiness center, A decent gym, swimming pool but it was closed during our stay, The Quan Spa. (Great service but overpriced!!)Overall4 out of 5 stars because of location. That's not really true since the location was really close to the Huang Pu River and close to many interesting sites. The real downside was the traffic congestion caused by the new subway line construction. Would definitely stay there again. Price is awesome. Will probably sky rocket once the subway is complete. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Good choice for SH We stayed in the Ren. Yuyuan for two nights in late Nov. 2007. We booked using a combination of Marriott points and the 1,200RMB introductory rate for the new hotel. I would say that at this rate, it was a very good value for Puxi, Shanghai. Location was excellent - a few hundred meters away from the Westin Bund Center, directly behind Yu Gardens and relatively centrally located. There is some kind of construction going outside in front of the hotel, which forced most taxis to do a U-turn to get you to the hotel - I noticed no noise from the construction while during our stay.The room was good but not great - I personally didn't care for the color scheme and the rooms were a bit on the smaller side by American standards (but not uncomfortably so). Everything was clean and all the needed amenities were available (including a French Press coffee maker). Bed was comfortable - not as firm as other matresses we experienced during our stay in China. However, the sheets were not of the highest standard. Towels were great.Three points stand out about this hotel:1. The executive lounge was the best we experienced in China and better than any I can think of in the U.S. Hot breakfast; high quality espresso machine; two internet access computers; newspapers; dried fruit, nuts and cookies along with soft drinks, coffee and beer were available all day; light dinner plus wine and cocktails available after 5:30pm. Additionally, as a previous post mentioned, the view of Yu Garden and the river/Pu Dong was incredible - especially after dark when Yu Garden was lit -up. 2. The fitness/spa facility -located on the top two stories of building was fantastic. Wall to ceiling high windows in pool area (infinity pool + hottub) and fitness equipment area. A good number of machines available with TV sets. Views from this top floor fitness/pool area were approximately 200 degrees around from starting from the Bund/PuDong. Really incredible at night.3. Service - service was unpretentious, courteous and very good. At times it was over-the top and a bit unpolished; however, you felt that each individual wanted to help you and would go out of their way to do so. English skills were adequate to good.The only downside was taxi service - it generally took a few minutes during busy times to get a cab and some cabs did not know the location of the hotel (maybe 20% of cabbies did not know how to get there in our experience).Overall, I would rate it a better experience than most Ren. hotels I've stayed at in the U.S. for a comparable price. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Outstanding! I booked this hotel by accident, but what a good thing it turned out to be! I checked in a day before the official opening ceremony, and enjoyed the ultra-modern, brand-new accommodations with superior service.The proximity to the Yuyuan Gardens [walking distance] and the Bund [best to take a taxi] make it a perfect location for site seeing, fine dining and shopping. The rooms are modern, comfortable, the bed is heavenly. The soaking tub in the bathroom with the glass wall enables you to enjoy a hot bath while looking out over the lights of the city. And the view of the Pu-Dong at night from the executive lounge is breath-taking. The staff is very attentive and aims to please in all ways: even taking you shopping. My only complaint is the taxis were a bit hard to come by -- a 15 min advance call was required. This was due to the fact that the hotel is so new, not all cab drivers knew about it yet. "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"Really Surprised My wife and me stayed at Yuyuan Hotel for 5 nights, 30/9-05/10. I'm really surprised about the other travellers reviews. The hotel was opened in september 07, so everything is clean and new. We stayed in a room and it seems to be used for the fist time. Rooms size is not too big, but they are really lively decorated, with a splendid bathroom separated with a glass wall.Breakfast was really good, with variety of chinese and western food.And about location, I think is much better than other hotels around the busy and opressive East Nanjin Road, is just 100 meters from Yuyuan Garden area and only 250 meters from the Westin Bund hotel.Regards "
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,Wait until new subway line opened 3 nights during National Day holidayTook more than one hour from Pudong Airport to the hotel.Most cab drivers dont know this hotel. Must tell them either Yu Yuan or give them the direction Lobby is on the 4th floor. Check-in is quick. Room is on the small side. Not much space to move around. Bath room isbig particularly when considering the size of the room itself.Buffet breakfast (RMB170) selection is not huge but adequate.Some confusion during seating the first morning (Oct01) whenthe coffee shop was 80% full. Less than 10 persons in the coffee shop the 2nd and 3rd morning.Getting a cab during rush hours or bad weather is definitely abig problem (in fact this a a problem in the entire Shanghai butwould be very bad around this hotel). This situation will beimproved after the subway passing thru right outside the hotelis opened in 1 or 2 years time (it will definitely be opened beforeWorld Expo which is in 2010). Better ask hotel to book a cab for you in advance for your trip to airportBell boys and doorman provided good servicePersonally dont like the area around the hotel (Yu Yuan and Shanghai old street although there are so many local andforeign tourists come here for something I dont understand)Would not come back to this hotel until subway is in use 
renaissance shanghai yuyuan hotel ,"New very new We have spent 2 nights in this brand new hotel which was just opened for a week or so (grand opening due in mid-september). The hotel is new, and it's nice. The people are friendly and willing to help, but staffs do seem to be very inexperienced and a bit slow nonetheless very polite. The hotel is situated right next to Yuyuan so you get to look over the old building (one of the landmarks for tourists) and the neighbourhood gives you a taste of the traditional bits of Shanghai.The hotel is so new that most taxi drivers do not quite know their way but somehow it's not hard to find since everyone knows YuYuan and the hotel is just right next to it. We stayed in the normal deluxe room and the facilities are quite good. The phone is cordless and of course internet services were fitted in the room. The shower is good. The minibar is really expensive though… I think it's like 65 RMB for a coke… The only problem we had with the hotel was the difficulty in getting hold of a cab on Friday night. We had been waiting for over 25 mins… while we waited we tried to get the Concierge to arrange for a hotel car but hotel staff insisted that these cars could only be rented at a minimum rate of 4 hours. I think this is in fact a bit stupid and the inflexibility is a bit annoying (especially when you see 6- 8 cars and drivers waiting outside the hotel doing nothing) and the hotel refused to arrange anyone of them to take us to somewhere which will only take 15-20 mins by car. The manager eventually gave in after 30 mins wait and that was also the time when a taxi finally drove in. I think transportation would be an area that this hotel should look into, but apart from that, the rest of the experience was enjoyable. The rooms are just like those shown on the hotel website (unlike many others which may dissappoint you upon arrival)! "

renaissance shanghai zhongshan park hotel ,"Improvement needed to meet the standards of Mariott The setting of the rooms are good but there is still room for significant improvement, specifically on the following topics :1) internet connection very slow2) room sometimes very cold3) breakfast times do not correspond with the times indicated in the guest services directory. Directory says 6.00 am, in reality it is 6.30 am and, even then, staff was not fully ready.4) Beers in the Zpark bar are not served in the appropriate glasses.At this stage I would not recommend this hotel but could revise my opinion if the general service level is improved. I consider that the above topics could be fixed rather quick.Luc Godefroidluc.godefroid@us.henkel.com "
renaissance shanghai zhongshan park hotel ,"Promising First Visit When in Shanghai I usually prefer to stay in a more central location such as Nanjing Rd but this new hotel offered an attractive introductory corporate rate so decided to give it a go. The location is some way from city centre and attractions but it is situated right beside a metro station. This is the first time I have made use of the metro in Shanghai and I found it to be cheap, clean and easy to use although it can be congested at busy times. The hotel is built directly on top of a shopping mall which also contains plenty of restaurants but part from the mall there is not much else in the area although there is a lot of construction and development work taking place in the area which suggests that this may change soon.As commented in previous reviews the hotel occupies the top half of the building only with check in on the 25th floor. This involves separate lifts to the reception desk and then on to the rooms which is one of my pet hates. It is further frustrating that some of the hotel facilities such as the fitness centre are on the lower levels. I did try the fitness centre and although well equipped was exceptionally busy as it is widely used by the general public as well as hotel guests. Admittedly my visit to the fitness centre was at peak time. The rooms themselves are well furnished and comfortable as you should expect from a new hotel.The hotel offers both Western and south east Asian restaurants but given the high number of eateries in the mall below these are quiet which is a great shame as I ate in the Asian restaurant on my last night and the food was truly excellent.Overall this was a promising visit to a new hotel and I will give it consideration for future visits "
renaissance shanghai zhongshan park hotel ,"Good standard 5-star fare but location may not suit everybody If you're in Shanghai for business and your meetings are mostly at the Pudong area (Lujiazhui for example), then you will find that this hotel's location is simply too far away from the action. That's exactly what I found out when I first had a meeting near Science &amp; Technology Centre at 9 am, then have to be back at Huaihai Road for a 10.30 am meeting, then lunch at Yan'an West Road near Jiangsu Road, before finally having to go to Lujiazhui again for a 4 pm presentation. Whew!If I'm not Chinese or don't recognise Chinese characters, I'd have been forced to take a taxi to complete this juggernaut. And trust me, the traffic jams in Shanghai make a short 6km route last hours, so that'd make me late, late, late! So I depended on the metro, but even that was no fun having to cross from one end of Shanghai to the other end!So, I reckon if you want something more central, choose those hotels at Nanjing West Road, Lujiazhui or even Nanjing East Road. I've earlier reviews of some of the hotels in these areas, which I stayed in during the halcyon days when my budget was fatter and my boss less concerned about minute travel costs.So, thanks to the current global economic crisis, I've been &quot;exiled&quot; to this part of Shanghai, which is a good 15-20km away from the heart of action. Granted there is a nice mall right beneath the hotel, but it's just the ONLY one mall with nothing much around (unless you love shopping for old computers and IT knick-knacks at the &quot;mall&quot; opposite). But if you like taking the metro and don't mind the (massive) crowds in one of the world's most populous cities, the fact that this hotel is located just above a metro station will find favour with you. Getting food quickly, shopping for some groceries to fill up your room's mini-bar and going to the other parts of Shanghai served by the metro would never be an issue. Convenience is the tagline here.Amenities wise, this hotel suffers from the weird design of those hotels which form part of a big building which is actually an office block. Those who'd stayed at the Grand Hyatt Jinmao at Lujiazhui and JW Marriott at Tomorrow Square will know what I mean. Having the lobby at the 25th floor, then the gym being on the 10th and your room on the 38th and the breakfast place on the 26th floor, and all using other elevators, will be confusing enough for anybody, me included. Imagine having a dip at the gym pool and wrapped in your bathrobes, you take the elevator with other guests and office workers to the 25th floor lobby, then walk with dripping water to the other elevator some 20m away and then take another elevator to your room on the 46th floor. One reason why I did not use my trunks despite having high hopes of doing so this time round.But then again, if you're a sucker for high-rise hotels and love those views from a 46th floor glass window, this one is for you. Yes, admittedly, I loved the view from my room too, but as a frequent visitor to Shanghai, there wasn't too much for me to be thrilled about. And we aren't talking about a view of the Lujiazhui financial district and the Bund is more than 20km away.All in all, this new hotel had all the touches of a 5-star outfit and the software, especially the wait staff at the breakfast place and the front desk staff, lived up to expectations. I think good training plays a strong role here and I am happy Renaissance is able to achieve this in a city not truly known for good service and the people usually deemed less than courteous.Oh, one small (quirky) thing to mention: the suggestive uniform of the staff... I notice they are made to wear a coat or just a suit with no shirt, blouse or even a T-shirt under it! So you can see the cleavage of some of the more well-endowed staff and the chest hairs of those others who are more stout and erm, manly. Gosh! I know I should not complain since it's a feast for the eyes, but still.... haha "
renaissance shanghai zhongshan park hotel ,"Convenient to Hongqiao Airport/Shopping/Metro Station Extremely pleased with my recent visit. Very modern 60 storey hotel sits atop large Cloud Nine shopping center and main Metro line (Zhongshan Park station: lines 2, 3,4). Within 5-6 miles of Hongqiao Business Park, Shanghai Innovation Business Park and Southern Railway Station. Easy to find at night since the building is outlined by neon blue lights. I could be over in Pudong area across the river in &lt;40 minutes by straight subway line (avoid traffic and taxi fare). Same subway line will drop you off at People's Square, Nanjing Road, and the Bund, in 15 minutes. Good sized rooms are new and very modern with comfortable beds and flat panel TVs. Executive lounge is unique dual-level; very large, comfortable and decently stocked with drinks and light snacks brought to you by attentive hotel staff during certain hours. Plentiful breakfast buffet in morning. Azur restaurant has standard hotel fare. Multiple choices for dining (both fast food and sit down) at the Cloud Nine shopping center without ever leaving the buidling. If you fly in to Shanghai domestically to Hongqiao airport and are doing business or sightseeing on this side of the river, then this is very convenient. If flying in to Shanghai Pudong International airport and doing business in Pudong area then I would recommend the Renaissance Pudong. "
renaissance shanghai zhongshan park hotel ,"Easy Access Location The hotel sits next to / atop a shopping mall (Cloud Nine Shopping Mall - http://shanghai.iknowthiscity.com/?p=229). The metro runs under the mall in the basement level and is easily accessible from the hotel without having to go outside. The metro station is Zhongshan Park on line #2, with interchanges to lines #3 and #4. Line #2 runs east-west and will take you to most tourist destinations. RMB3 will get you to destinations west of the river like Peoples Park (Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Grand Theatre, etc.) and RMB4 gets you east across the river to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jinmao Tower, etc. RMB4 will also get you to Long Yang Lu station where you can get the MagLev to Pudong (RMB40). For RMB 44, you can get from Pudong to the hotel easily within ONE HOUR which is cheaper than a taxi (fare is about RMB200) and faster, especially during weekdays.Within the mall, there are dozens of restaurants and fast food places. Almost all menus are in Chinese and English. The location is more in the residential area, so the staff are not as fluent in English as in tourist areas such as Nanjing Road, but sufficient to get by.The hotel itself lives up to the Renaissance name. The staff is fluent in English and professional. The only minor drawback is that the lobby is on the 25th floor which means you have to take one elevator to the 25th and then another elevator to your room. Strangely the hotel does not offer a turn-down service. Otherwise I recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the central part of Shanghai. The shanghai metro is very easy to use and get around, offering a cheaper, faster way to get around, making this hotel a great value. "

renaissance yangtze hotel ,The bed is good and also the clublounge service The title say's about all what is better then average I normally experience. the staff was very helpfull and friendly. Stayed here for one night. Stayed in more hotels in Shanghai with about the same (company)-rate as this hotel and have to state this is my last stay here. I took the clublounge upgrade for reason same price as seperate additional internet + breakfast + lounge-promotion-stuff. The building is clearly from the older architecture style of Hotel-building. There is no separate shower (in bathtub with curtain) and the room was not spacy. Location good for starting travel west for Suzhou or evening stuff in Puxi. 
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"VEry Nice Hotel Stayed for 2 nights at the Renaissance hotel in the middle of the Shanghai business district in Sep 2007.The location is fantastic and the rooms were great. The staff and their service was also very good.They tool care of me well considering this was my first trip to Shaighai.Breakfast buffet spread was huge and tasty as well.The rooms were bright and clean. The gym facility was fully functional and useful with good stock of towels and water.We orderd pizza in room service when we wanted something quick and to our surprise it tasted so delicious, we ended up ordering more of the same. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Speedways to Progress! I moved to the Renaissance Yangtze Hotel as it was just across my Business Associates' Offices. Breakfast was not included in the price &amp; was quite expensive, though good. The view of the Speedways and speeding traffic was something. Showed what China was all about. The foot massage lady was great. She also comes to the Room if you want.Rooms were really nice and staff was good. Seems like the Management was very good at training their staff. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Exhibition centre Some hotels near to exhibition centres can be &quot;well used&quot; and &quot;jaded&quot;, but not this one.The Renaissance offers sumptuous beds and very quiet rooms. Everywhere is perfectly clean and well maintained. The restaurants are very well serviced and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. After long, tiring days at the nearby exhibition centre, this hotel is a treat to savour.If you are thinking of shopping at one of the nearby shopping malls, make sure that you have a large limit on your credit card. The goods may carry a very well known European or Japanese brand name, but they also carry a very high price tag. Curiously, the hotel's own shop has some attractive souvenirs to offer, and they will readily accept the principle of bargaining. Just be prepared to spend some time to reach a final price! "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Comfortable City Hotel I stayed for one week on business, but managed a couple of personal days for sightseeing.Checkin at mid-day was fast and pleasant: I took the club upgrade, which entitles you to breakfast, and 'happy hour' for free drinks and nibbles in the evening, in the penthouse amongst other perks. Refreshments in the lobby were rather expensive, even for a 4/5 star hotel. My room was well appointed with a kingsize bed, LCD TV and en-suite. I was hosted by colleagues from my company all week so did not have a chance to try the hotel's restaurants. I used the pool and sauna twice, and inspected the gym: all very good.Across the road (under the elevated roadway) to the right is an oasis of tranquility called the New Town Central Park where, on a nice day, you can relax as you stroll round for an hour or so. The hotel is within easy walking distance of some large shopping malls. There are taxis at the entrance to take you downtown at a reasonable rate.Staff were all very pleasant and courteous, and contributed to my very enjoyable stay. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Disappoint Stay this hotel again at last Nov for business trip, my last stay was in mid-2005. Feel this hotel getting worse than worse! Check in at mid-night, but no greeting by check-in staff....the breakfast service is worse, also Chinese restaurant expensive but service and food far behind than before... Talk to their restaurant staff, ineresting they said the ex-food and beverage manager from Hong Kong was gone to other hotel, then the standard is dropping down. Is this excuse for the customers? I won't recommend to my friends! "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"good business hotel stay here for business purpose onlyhongqiao area is far from tourist and real shanghai areasis a new development that looks like any other western cityif first and only visit to shanghai stay at the bund areanormal clean rooms nothing fancy good buffet breakfastgubei area is near with lots of restaurants and supermarket (taxi)walking distance you hace a food street ,also new with many western choices (Mc,starb,hoot etc)if there stop in front of sheraton building and grab something from Zoes cafeteria,very good value in coffe and lunch "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Great retreat from the busy streets of Shanghai We stayed in a club level room for six nights and this hotel made Shanghai much more enjoyable for us. As first time travelers (from the US) to China, we suffered from culture shock at times while we were in Shanghai, but it was always a pleasure to come back to the Renaissance.Our room was comfortable and fairly modern. We took advantage of the good-sized mini-fridge to store a few groceries which we had purchased from the foreigner-friendly Friendship Store across the street from the hotel.We found that having access to the club was key, as that included an easy and filling breakfast (with lots of Western style food choices) each day, and drinks throughout the day. When we did eat at the main hotel restaurant a couple times, the food was quite good but also very expensive.The service provided by the concierge was impeccable. We relied on them quite often to write our destination in Mandarin so that we could communicate with the taxi drivers. All the employees of the hotel whom we met spoke very good English.This hotel's location is a bit out of the center of the city, but it's not bad at all. We found that taxi rides to the Bund, People's Square, etc. typically took about 20-30 minutes. Great hotel; decent location; the perfect retreat from Shanghai's chaotic streets. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,Comfortable and Stylish at the Renaissance I was here at the tail end of a 2 week business trip. The hotel is quite near our office here so a logical choice. The room was very nice - extra comfy bed (best one on the trip) with plenty of pillows.The bathroom amenities all had an Asian smell (lemongrass) which was really nice as well. The gym was pretty good - decent equipment and personal TVs at each one. The weights were ok - enough to tide me over. I agree with the other reviewer - the breakfasts were amazing -great selection of pastries - very nice - and they had the typical omelet station and Asian/Indian/Japanese on top of the Western fare.Food was a little pricey (by Shanghai standards) but not unexpected for a top end hotel. 
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Very nice hotel helpful and courteous staff but pillows were smelly of rancid This was a good hotel. I was assigned to the wrong room with an occupant. I went back to the desk, the manager apologised but no compensation. Room was OK and neat but pillows stank with rancid sweat. I was too tired to complain and slept and left the next morning.Breakfast was OK - standard fare.A bit remote "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Excellent Hotel I recently stayed at the Shanghai Renaissance. The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful. The room was large and well appointed. The bathroom was also roomy.The buffet served a variety of western food for both breakfast, lunch and dinner. During the evening they had a string quartet play in the lobby which was a nice touch.The concierge helped us book a tour of Shanghai. Get a personal guide it is worth the money. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"great hotel clean rooms Very clean and modern hotel. Breakfast buffet was extensive with american and asian offerings. Hotel staff was formal and helpful. Location is not convenient to where we wanted to be, but I will definitely stay there again. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,Consistently Good hotel Stayed recently again. Only after asking did I realise its a short walk to Intex and Shanghai Mart expo hallsExcellent service throughout from arrival to checkout. Breakfast is good and the bar pleasant. Rooms are well appointed with good beds and showers. Minor grumble about the Aircon thermostat buzzing as it switched on &amp; off. The Sushi restaurant while good is expensive so you choose and the other eteries are fine and upto the standard of many hotels.Its a bit out of town so about 1 hour by car to PVG while Hongchow [sic] is pretty close. Taxi into central ~30 rmb or 15 mins ishGood gym &amp; pool if you have time. 
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Renaissance reflected Just returned from a week long stay at this hotel.The food was wonderful!, especially so the bread and pasteries which were better than Paris!The breakfast buffet was excellent with western, eastern and some 'in between' dishes.The location is a bit more remote from the Bund, but the taxis are cheeep, and getting around with signs in both Mandarin and English is helpful.Shopping is not 'centralized' in Shanghai ,as the Hongquia pearl market is proximally located to the hotel.The spa is well equipted and relaxing ,with both cold &amp; hot plunge pools along with the requisite sauna &amp; steam rooms.The management, especially Robert the Food Service Manager ,were excellent in assisting with food choices both in house ,as well as the excellent surrounding Dining choices.Intend to return to Shanghai ,as well as the Renaisance Yangtze, in the not too distant future. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"shower tempurature problem comfortable bed, good/friendly staff, small room, small bath, shower temperature changes every 1 minute, long taxi queue during commute hours (there is no public transportation around, and with its location, you pretty much have to take taxi anywhere to/from the hotel.) "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"Good gym the sell is the comfy rooms. This hotel is not in the city center but in Shanghai, cabs are so cheap that staying away from the crowd can be a wise choice. The hotel has a great gym (free), opens early at 5:30am, and the spa is pretty good. The breakfast is one of the best ones. They have Chinese, Japanese and great American breakfast food, lots of fresh pre-cut fruits for a hotel breakfast. The rooms are very nice and modern, they are not over the top and are very efficiently designed. It makes you feel like home after a few days. The Executive floor lounge has a very nice happy-hour selection of beer, wine, snacks (hot and cold)and sweets. The hotel restaurants are okay but definitely eat out if possible. Overall, 3 times of staying there have been a positive experience. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"soft coccon I have stayed here numerous times, the last time in May 2005. Always felt a sense of being cared for there. Great new pillows and comforters. The pastry shop in the lobby is great, for snacks or a simple breakfast. Slightly off location, and one side of the building is next to the freeway. "
renaissance yangtze hotel ,"really enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights on a business trip in November '04 -- very nice environment, staff, comfortable rooms and accommodations. Had regular room service breakfast: one morning they were 10 min late, and I noted same to the manager: got complimentary breakfast the following morning, as well as a plate of fruit and chocolates. Hotel is close to shopping, other large hotels, and to Starbucks !! One down note: rush-hour taxi line is too long, both in the morning and in the evening -- plan ahead for a car. "

rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,Pleasant rooms in a good location Having read previous reviews I was very concerned that the tour group we were with had booked this hotel. They assured us it was good quality and we were relieved to find it was. The rooms were clean with modern decor - we stayed in two different rooms and both were fine. The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom had all lots of nice marble and glass. The hotel is located near a busy road but this makes for good connections with the main attractions. The only thing that was less than perfect was the breakfast area which was hectic although it did have a good range of Western and Oriental food. 
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Hated the place Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It's got everything that could spell accommodation NIGHTMARE.We were hit with stench of some terrible odor which lasted from the hotel lobby to our room corridor.Disinterested waitress who chat amongst themselves with stale, overcooked buffet breakfast greet us in the morning.Was just sitting around hotel lobby, reading guide book bought from Sydney, got bitten by mosquitoes that hangs around hotel lobby and accused of stealing the guide book by the gift shop assistant.Many times we had to stop the maid from cleaning our room when we clearly put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door. We complained to the reception about this, then the same night , I got bitten by BED BUGS and couldn't sleep the entire night.Would avoid this place like the plague.It's a shame Australian management has stooped to such a low level!

rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Wonders of China Tour Shanghai:Rendezvous Merry Hotel - &quot;Appalling.&quot;A TripAdvisor Member, Liverpool, U.K.Stayed at this hotel in the finale of a 'Wonders of China Tour.'Have been back in the U.K. for 2-weeks and we are still trying to get over food poisoning.The lobby, a vast open unappealing area, was draughty and cold.Our hotel room and bathroom, though somewhat cramped, was clean and presentable.By far the worst part of the hotel is it's restaurant. A breeding ground for bacteria. It is probably the worst hotel restaurant we have been to in any part of the world. The buffet style food is presented in large containers kept warm for hours on end by 2-candles beneath each of the containers. Many of the candles had burnt themselves out and were not replaced. At best, the food was only ever lukewarm. The thought of it still makes us shudder. The chefs (if that is what you could call them!) did not wear hats. All of the restaurant staff appeared totally disinterested. They just chatted amongst themselves.Overall, our impression is that management is poor and there needs to be root and branch overhaul of employee practices and restaurant hygeine.My wife and I will never stay at one on these chain of hotels ever again. This hotel alone spoilt our 6-week holiday to Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and China. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"An excellent hotel I recently stayed at this hotel for one week on a business trip to China. The hotel was booked by my company; I had no say in the matter and in fact it was not the company's first choice for my stay.No matter. I found it perfectly clean and comfortable, and it certainly lived up to its' rating. Admittedly the location is not so good from the tourist's point of view, but without wishing to seem selfish I was in China on business and not for tourism.But for those tourists who make the effort to work out the vagaries of the Shanghai underground, the nearest Metro station (Jiangsu Rd) is only about 10 - 15 mins walk away. Taxis are not too difficult to get - no more difficult than anywhere else in Shanghai.I did not dine there but I did have the buffet breakfast every day. I found this to be excellent. My only criticism was when I asked for a bag to be placed in the room so I could send some clothes to the laundry. In fact they actually took the clothes which I had left out and had them laundered, which included some I didn't want to be included - but that was hardly the crime of the century!I would certainly recomend this hotel to others and I would stay there again "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,really a conference hotel Stayed in this hotel after a long tour of china staying in a variety of hotels 3* to 5* .The Hotel is as other people have said a bit out of the way for the bund and shopping etc But taxis are easy to get and cheap.it is near the expressway but so is every hotel in shanghai ! The rooms were clean and had all the facillitys but by most hotel standards very small .Ok for one nighters but not as a base.This hotel caters mainly for conferences so is a bit impersonel but the staff were fine ane spoke better english than i spoke chinese.Food was ok i recommend the breakfast but other meals a bit motel style .The worst part was the bar .It was VERY expensive and carried a 15% surcharge on everything ! you were better off getting a taxi and going to a local bar street (Blue Frog Nanyong street 10mins away 60p fare )where most of the europeans drank .friendly atmosphere and CHEAP !!The overall view of this Hotel is that its OK but there are better about 
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Had to move after one night This hotel is in the worst location, has the worst &quot;restaurants&quot; of any hotel I've stayed in, noone speaks English, and it took so long to get the smell of the hotel out of my clothes. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Good hotel This is a very good hotel but a little away from the &quot;action&quot;. You need a cab, bus or the metro to get to the main attractions. The staff are not really all that friendly but they are very efficient. The breakfasts are very good but don't bother eating any other meal as the service and the food are not that good.The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice for the price.They &quot;ran out&quot; of white wine (yes the entire hotel had no white wine for 2 evenings)Worth the price though. Depends on what you want. It's safe, clean and reasonably central. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Modern Hotel for A Big City Top notch hotel geared for business travelers and tourists alike (first hotel we used in China that had an iron in the room). Clean, comfortable, well equipped. Can't say anything negative, except as a tourist, it might be helpful to stay at a hotel closer to the Bund since we were always taking taxis down to that area. We used the subway in Shanghai as well - fantastic, clean, easy to use (maps, fares), lots of posts in English. A little confusing on the street to find our way back to hotel, but we eventually made it. Breakfast top notch as well, Western and Asian buffet, good service, very minimal box breakfast if you have to leave early (not even any butter with the rolls, which were at least fresh). "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"This is a MOTEL not a HOTEL! This place calls itself a 5-star hotel, in reality, its more like a motel. The front entrance and the lobby looked modern, but the rooms are terrible. Their Chinese dinner restaurant consisted of 7 odd sized tables with almost no ventilation in a room no larger than 300 sq. feet. Since my family and I are non-smokers, the second-hand smoke we endured sure made me think of lung cancer. The driveway exiting the hotel is very dangerous, heavy with pedestrian/bicycle/scooter/vehicle traffic, each time we drove out we came close to getting into an accident. My travel agent has been notified not to recommend this hotel to others. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,a really bad mistake we booked an executive suite for 5 nights.the room was dark and uninviting.it had a vile smell.the couch and bed were so hard it was impossible to get comfortable.the food in the lounge was cold. we checked out after 1 night .reception did not as why we were checking out early so we felt that just summed up the place they obviously have enough customers so they dont need to care 
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Smelly room We booked this hotel in December 2006 for five nights as part of a holiday in China but only stayed one night. Our room smelled of mould and urine. Hotel staff were competent but not overly helpful. When we asked to change rooms they gave us a key to the new room but did not offer to move our bags despite my partner having a fractured arm in a sling from a fall from a few days before. When I asked for a tourist map the receptionist laughed or rather sneered. It is an Australian run hotel with Australian prices (high for China) and Australian service standards (mediocre to poor). After inquiring about nearby restaurants to eat at and being told that there were some about twenty minutes walk away, we decided to have a meal in the hotel bar. The menu was standard Australian pub food - chips, burgers, tuna sandwiches etc. A tuna sandwich and a burger with two beers set us back 388 yuan or about $70. The hotel is next to a very busy and noisy expressway. I am not sure if it is central but it is about a 30 minute taxi ride from the Bund and Nanjing Road East which is not ideal from a tourist's point of view. It is a good place to stay if you want to watch English language television or want to converse with the many Australians who stay there but you might be better off doing that in Australia. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Exceeded my expectations...Value for $$ Though this hotel might not be 5-stars,I am still giving an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating because for the price I paid relative to other centrally located hotels (big-chain). This was a steal. This hotel is rather centrally located and well kept. Room was clean and orderly. Though I found the bathroom a little cramp (they included both a shower and bathtub) but that was not a big deal. Bathroom amenities though rather standard were sufficient and they even had a rain shower! Truly relaxing after a long day of sightseeing etc. Hotel also provided 2 bottles of drinking water a day, which came in handy.During my 3 nights stay, I managed to get a good rate inclusive of breakfast which served to make my stay even sweeter. =) If you can, do request for a room facing the city as those views are nicer and the rooms are a tad brighter and bigger!As in most parts of China, cabs are cheap and plentiful so it was convenient getting from place to place. Will definitely consider staying here again. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Super Hotel. Great Value What a lovely hotel this is. OK, not quite as good as the Hilton in Shanghai, but it's a chinese hotel and you really would have to split hairs to tell the differance. We only stayed 2 nights (£38 for a double room) elegant, very friendly, lovely breakfast (included in the price)very clean. Large room with Kingsize bed. Bathroom is lovely, all the extras that you would need. Extreamly central. But a taxi is only 60p within a two mile radius and the porter just calls one for you. "
rendezvous merry hotel shanghai ,"Good Home Away From Home Stayed at the Rendezvous for one night in July. Actually this was my 5th visit to this hotel. The location for me is excellent since it is near my source of business but some may find it not as convenient. The rooms are spotless, everything works and the breakfast buffet wonderful. The staff is pleasant, solicitous and very helpful. The air conditioning worked well which is an important consideration for Shanghai in July. There is plenty of traffic around the hotel but the rooms are quiet and the traffic is not heard. A good night's sleep was the result. We shall return. "

royalton hotel shanghai ,"Wonderful hotel at a reasonable price We started our Grand Circle tour at the Royalton Hotel. It was a beautiful Western style hotel with an amazing breakfast buffet. We came back through Shanghai on our own after the tour and stayed at the Royalton again. We had left some bags with them, so we wouldn't have to carry them along on the rest of the tour, and we were so glad they had this service. The breakfast buffet has everything one could desire, from Chinese breakfasts to eggs, bacon, fruit, pastries, etc. They even have an omelet station. The other restaurants at the hotel are wonderful. A bar with a short menu is available in the lobby area. The other restaurant located on the ground floor serves great food from a more continental menu. The restaurant on the second floor offers a variety of Chinese selections. We ate at all of these and never had a bad meal, but our favorite was the second floor Chinese menu. The French Concession was a short taxi ride from the hotel, and an amazing section of the city we did not see on our tour. We walked to the Bund from the French Concession, and while it is a long walk, it was such an interesting perspective of the city. We felt like we lived there. So, yes, the Royalton is a long way from the Pudong airport, but for the money and the style, we would gladly go back there. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Average at best. - Okey rooms. Fairly Average.- Nothing Amazing, everything was basic.- The Rain shower was nice, but the water was a bit yellow.- Room was comfortable.- Location is Far out from the City. 30 mins taxi to everything.- An Old Tesco is across the street to buy groceries- Make sure you bring a hotel card if you go out. Most taxi's don't know the hotel by name.- Lobby smells like Cigars.- The Whole hotel Smells like Cigars. Even in a non-smoking floor.- You can Hear the highway at night if you open the window.A Fairly basic hotel, i won't Recommend. Stay at the Pudong Shangri-La, Now, that was Amazing! "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"hidden gem of a hotel I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip. It's pretty close to the Hangquo airport. It took about 20 minutes by car from the airport to the hotel. The hotel's located in a pretty busy area, but it's tucked away from most of the hustle and bustle, which is a good and bad thing. It's good b/c the hotel was pretty quiet, it's bad b/c it took a pretty long time to catch a taxi.Food was good.The room was clean.You're able to get a room w/ a computer, but I wouldn't recommend it. I asked for a room w/ a computer, and it didn't work. A tech came up to fix it, but it still didn't work. They gave me a different room, but that room's computer worked, only after the tech came up to fix it. Nonetheless, the room was clean and comfortable. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Nice choice for slightly off the beaten path in Shanghai We stayed here a single night for a business trip. The location was about a 1.5 hour drive in 6PM Shanghai traffic from the Pudong Airport. The rooms were clean and with very modern styling. Many western channels are available on the TVs, plenty of English signs, and the beds were soft by Chinese standards. The hotel has several dining options, and the Chinese restaurant properly reflects the milder, fusion, Shanghai cuisine.We would definitely stay at this location again. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Great hotel soso location The rooms were in good condition, beds comfortable. The best part was the resturant food! The breakfast buffet was great, such a variety. Staff was friendly and helpful. It is located to a huge market/store that is a good place to get snacks and things like that. One problem would be the location. Its a little congested around the hotel and a bit far from The Bund. Other than that I recommend this place. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Absolutely Fabulous This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to China with Grand Circle Travel. This hotel is an amazing hotel. The rooms are top shelf (meaning great) and the service was the best I have ever experienced. I think the only part of the hotel that did not look like a million dollars was the stairwell that I walked up an down a few times for exercise one day (this was a service stairwell and guests would rarely see it unless they were crazy like me in need of a work-out). The beds were comfortable. The rooms were emasculate. The restaurants had excellent food and service. Right around the corner from the hotel is a huge Chinese supermarket from which we purchased some snacks to ease our food budget. In the mornings people from the surrounding neighborhood congregated in the court outside the market by the hotel for Tai Chi. The only thing that could make this hotel even better would be if it could be transplanted nearer the Bund or other tourist sites. However, the local color of its location more than made up for the longer drives to tourist sites. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Very good hotel We had a very enjoyable stay in the Royalton Hotel. The room was excellent and the resturant was superb. Resturant staff did have problems understanding English when you got away from ordering the meal, but this was no problem. Location is well away from the tourist sights in Shanghai, but that may well have been a plus. There is a very good supermarket across the street (underneath a sports arena) that is very large and well stocked and very cheap by US standards. There are only Chinese resturants in the area however. Several groups were doing exercises each morning around the hotel which was interesting. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"A ""sleeper""...going local was a great experience local friend suggested the hotel...it was great. Staff was friendly; reasonably good English; great facilities, rooms, linens and three restaurants. Almost a boutique-sized hotel, so not as impersonal as many of the chain hotels. High four star quality. General Manager grew up in France although is Chinese...management seems solid...younger staff, but then the hotel's only been open five years. Spa, night club, 3 restaurants, lobby lounge/bar. "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Nice room with very bad service Their restaurant offered very nice food, absolutely love it. We had deluxe suite, and the room was spacious with quality furnished. The service was very bad, especially the room attendant, she was just so rude. Anyway, I think I will be back only for the yum food! "
royalton hotel shanghai ,"Excellent up to date business hotel I stayed at the Royalton for a business conference so the location was not really by choice. The Royalton is located in the western part of Shanghai, quite far away from the usual tourist sites, though the metro station is only about 15 minutes walk away. There is also a supermarket conveniently next door in the UFO shaped &quot;gymnasium&quot;. If you don't mind the location, this is an excellent, modern, high class, high rise hotel with all the amenities. The hotel ran out of their standard rooms so I got a spacious two room suite with a good view, which I have no complaints about. The room included a good breakfast buffet consisting of both western and asian food. However, internet access was an extra charge (up to RMB100 per day) so beware when comparing rates (you should be able to find several Shanghai hotels that include free internet access in their room rates). The staff were polite and had a good understanding of English. I would stay here again for business, but probably not if I were sightseeing. "
ruijin hotel ,"Great Oasis in French Concession We stayed here at the end of a multi-week trip around China, during which we slept on a lot of trains and in youth hostels, so it was our treat to ourselves. Although we paid way more than any other night in China (about $175 compared with an average of $30-$50 elsewhere, which is still far less than the equivalent place would be in North America) it was totally worth it. The buffet in the morning alone (for the 3 of us) made up some of the difference. Service was great - they brought us tea to our room on our arrival. The atmosphere is very much reminiscent of colonial days -- in our wing there were rooms where both Chiang Kai Shek and Mao had stayed -- with beautiful wood furniture and high ceilings. My 9 year-old daughter was able to feel a little more independent than at other places, because there are beautiful grounds and she could go outside and hang on a tree, yet your right in the middle of Shanghai. You don't have to pay for in-house services. We found a great massage place just about a block up Ruijin Road, for $12 for a full hour, and they were open late. "
ruijin hotel ,"Ruijin Hotel is an oasis of calm in the confusion of shanghai The title says it all. To enter the compound of the Ruijin Hotel is to enter another world. After the noise and excitement of Shanghai's streets, it's a total pleasure to return to this island of calm "
ruijin hotel ,"old world experience-stay in bldg 1 or 2 only --just returned from a two night stay. quoted a price, than told them i did not want bldg 3-they tried to up the price 200RMB for the older bldgs. i balked and they honored the first quote. upon arrival were told we would be in bldg 2 and given a free upgrade to a suite!!--bldg 1 and 2 are older, historic and beautiful. as discussed in other posts bldg 3 is modern, close to noisy bars and set off from the breakfast/dinner restaurant. there is a lot of construction going on to allow for another bldg but noise was not an issue.--our suite covered two floors and was amazing!! on the first floor was a fully modern half bathroom, a mini bar area that included a free bottle of wine each night, large screen tv, sofa, and work desk. there was a wooden spiral staircase up to the second floor which had a king size bed, chaise lounge chair (and the best part) a full boby massage chair the bathroom was huge, fully modern w/ bidet, jacuzzi tub and separate shower. free bottles of water given each day in bathroom.--nightly turndown service included slippers, weather forecast card for next day and more bottled water--breakfasr included both mornings and wide selection of western and chinesefood. no complaints but i am not a big breakfast fan so am easy to please in that regard. dinner at the chinese restaurant was very good, reasonably priced.--staff were all friendly and able to communicate in english. managers on call were especially helpful.--beautiful grounds and easily walkable to attractions, taxis cheap if you prefer. to ride--a few downsides: room did smell like cigarettes but china is a smoking country so i am used to that: the carpet as well as upholstered furniture needs to be cleaned--all are pretty badly stained. if not for that i would have given a 5 star rating.--internet was free but wasn't working for part of our stay despite repeated efforts to correct. manager gave us fruit anf chocolate platter as way of apology--for an old shanghai experience, i would highly recommend this hotel but only stay in bldg 1 or 2 "
ruijin hotel ,"Half secluded villa half construction site The Ruijin is a frustrating experience right now -- so much of it is excellent, yet it's in the middle of a huge construction project. This is particularly a problem if you're in Building 3, which is located on the Maoming Road side of the property. Whereas it was once possible to walk through a garden to Buildings 1 and 2 (i.e. the front desk and the breakfast rooms), much of the central area has been demolished, concreted over, and walled in, leaving a circuitous pathway that pedestrians must share with cars. No doubt this is to expand the property in preparation for Expo 2010, but in the interim it's a pretty significant letdown.They've done the best anyone could do, installing a wall around the construction site to minimize its visual impact. But it's still a construction site, and work starts at about 7 a.m. The Face Bar, the Thai restaurant, and the Indian restaurant are all gone. All that remains is a small Japanese-style restaurant (which we never saw open), the breakfast (more on that in a moment), and the Art Deco cafe, which offers a very limited and rather expensive drinks-and-snacks menu. As our guidebook noted, service is uneven -- invariably well-intentioned, but not always as competent as would be ideal, especially at the breakfast. (One morning we have three people offering to take our eggs orders, but the next day? No one.) That said, there were no serious errors.The rooms in the third building are gigantic, which compensates for their being rather soulless (it's a modern building, probably dating from about 2000). The bathrooms include both shower and jacuzzi bath, which we never used but which my parents, in another room, quite appreciated. Internet service (via ethernet) is free, a nice touch. Oh, and there's also a free bottle of mediocre Chilean cabernet (2008, too young), which is good enough for the price.Location is excellent, of course, central to the French Concession. On the whole this is still a good hotel, good value so long as the caveats are understood. It's just a let down from what it was and, I hope, will again be. "
ruijin hotel ,"Loved it! I stayed at this hotel for 13 nights as a tourist in Shanghai. I selected the Ruijin for its setting in truly BEAUTIFUL GARDENS and for its location in The French Concession. High brick walls cut the property off from frenzied city life and contain rolling lawns, ponds, fountains, pathways, huge trees, and flower beds. I wandered these gardens every day. A couple of times I took a towel and laid down to read in the shade. One time a manager came and very politely told me I had to move because anticipated wedding guests shouldn't see me. Due to the beauty of the location, there were up to 5 weddings a day on Friday/Saturday/Sunday and in a number of ways they appeared to take priority over the guests of the hotels. I stayed in the modern building rather than one of the elegant historical ones. I expected as much when I requested the cheapest room rate. I was very happy in my room even though its view was of a neighbouring office building. THE ROOM had a luxury feel with a spacious marble-walled bathroom with large separate shower stall and quality finishes. It was exceptionally clean. The housekeeping staff were full of warm greetings and smiles.The room was totally quiet with the exception of one Saturday night when at midnight it sounded as if a soccer game were taking place above me. At first reception tried to defend the noise because of &quot;the weddings&quot; but later outdid themselves in dealing with it.The bell hops were the friendliest and sweetest I have met in my world travels even though tiping was not allowed. They spoke no English but would defer to the reception staff who did. THE RECEPTION STAFF tried very hard to speak English. They were cheerful, obliging and efficient. Owing to my ignorance of Mandarin, I asked them to write down my destinations for taxi drivers. Twice this method was not sucessful leading to nasty stand offs with the drivers and once returning to the hotel an hour later. As it was included in my room rate, I ate from the BREAKFAST BUFFET every morning. The dining room had lovely views. The buffet included Chinese foods (Dim Sum, Chinese porridge, etc.) and their versions of various western foods (smoked salmon, cereal, different-looking eggs/bacon/potatoes, an omlette station), fresh fruit and juices. Most unfortunately, on my 4th morning, I was sat near the kitchen and heard a man spit. I never felt the same about the food again. I tried the Chinese food restaurant one evening and found it disappointing (but that might be due to my ignorance of Chinese food) and the Thai food restaurant once for lunch - delicious but I've had better in Toronto. Twice I had a decent massage in the pretty little SPA building, only about $40. I enjoyed THE LOCATION of the hotel in the French Concession. Step outside the walls and I was immersed in the noisy city life of Shanghai inhabitants. The immediate streets were for daily life including a reliable bank machine. 5 minutes away to a big shopping street of international stores. 5 minutes too to Starbucks. Taxis everywhere.Should I visit Shanghai again, I will stay at the Ruijin. "
ruijin hotel ,"An atmospheric place We stayed in Ruijin for 5 nights on our way to Anhui province and then returned to stay the other 3 nights before our flight home. Didn't want to spoil our impression of Shanghai by trying a different hotel. Ruijin really added something special to a picture of a city. Or, actually, mostly it's grounds added. It was so quiet there, there's a lot of green, paths, corners, cafes on the hotel's territory.There was even a small stream, it was very romantic to sit over it on the terrace of one of the cafes, in the dark. There were sounds of that stream and of some insects or birds in the green. It felt very tropical on our first evening there, a real hothouse. Another cafe, th Face, which is very popular among Shanghai expats, gives a back-to colonial-times feeling. Actually, the whole French block where Ruijin is situated, made us remembering movies like Shanghai express with Marlene Dietrich, or In the mood for love of Wong Kar-Wai... There are other restaurants as well there, but even if you don't visit them, it's also nice to start your day by walking through the territory to an imposing red-brick fench which separates the world of this old mansion from all another world.As for the rooms in Ruijin, they are nothing luxurous, some of them are very spacious, some of them not. They have a mess of rooms' types, even on their web-site. One cannot understand, whether a standard room is the same that a superiour or a deluxe, and which of two is better, as their cost is the same. We tried a superior room and a deluxe one. The first was large, worn, with stains on the sofa and on the carpet, the second one was two times smaller and clean. It was very silent in both of them, and the bathrooms were great.Usually, we don't like going to the same hotel twice, it's more interesting to try something new, but in the case with Ruijin we would consider staying there again.So, if you priority is a place with a history and an atmosphere, this is it. If you want first a spotless comfort, better try some of the chain hotels. "
ruijin hotel ,"Wonderful grounds and building We stayed at Ruijin in October 2007 following the recommendation of Lonely Planet. The hotel is in the middle of the French Concession, in a rstored set of mansions - the main one is a mock Tudor. We would like to recommend the hotel very highly for severla reasons:1.It is situated in a quiter area of Shanghai but at the same time it is close to one of the main shopping areas and relatively close to one of the metro stations- although you wil have to walk a few blocks. 2 It surrounded by the most magnifecent romantic grounds that make you forget that the frenetic pace of the city.The grounds are very well maintained.3 The rooms are spacious and very adequately decorated and the breakfast offered trully wonderful, offering various Western and Chinese options.4 The hotel has a number of very famous and tastefully decorated restaurants that attract a number of the shanghai high society and offer the opportunity to see how the Chinese rich play. We would highlu recommend LanaThai.There were very few things we did not like abot the hotel1. There are very minimal business facilities and the demand over the couple computer stations can be high.2 There are no leasure facilities on site, but the hotel offers transport to near by facilities.3 The service needs some improvement, but with all fairness this is very common with Chinese hotles who have not yet developed high customer skills.4 The cost of dinning at the hotel restaurants is excessive, given our experience with China, but you pay for the service, decor, quality of the food etc. You do not have to eat there, but it is an experience. In coclusion this is a ture gem in Shanghai and a nice alternative from luxury hotel chains. It has a lot of character, the location is perfect for relaxation and thoroughly enjoyable. The hotel does not meet the high standards of other luxury hotels but it is in a category of its own! "
ruijin hotel ,"Shanghai Weekend I spent 3 nights at the Ruijin, 2 in a standard room and one in an executive suite because the hotel only had the suite available the third night. I liked the location of the hotel. It also has beautiful grounds to wander. The standard room was nice, very spacious. The only issues which were minor were that the closet safe didn't work and the toilet had some mechanical problems. The third night we had to move to an executive suite. It was OK but not worth the money. Carpet was quite dirty as well in this room. I preferred the standard room. "
ruijin hotel ,"A great night at the Ruijin Stayed one night at the Ruijin and enjoyed it very much. I spent HOURS researching hotels in Shanghai and narrowed it down to Mansion Hotel or the Grand Hyatt, but rates were so high and once I got to China I couldn't fathom spending that much on a hotel room, given that we were spending $4 on meals.... So we opted for the Ruijin at the last minute and were very glad we did so. The grounds are lovely and the location is GREAT - right in the heart of the French Concession neighborhood and walkable to so many neat areas. We arrived at about 10 a.m. (on the night train from Beijing) and they gave us early check-in into our gorgeous room in the main building (I was very glad we were in the main building, it seemed to be the most picturesque). We had a corner top floor room with a balcony - lots of nice touches - free water, tea in the afternoon, etc. We had a bit of a wait getting a cab at night at the hotel but if you walk out to the street, no wait at all. The breakfast buffet was included and it was fine - lots of choices (obviously set up for travelers from all around the world). Only downside was internet - it was RMB1 per minute (about $5 for 30 mins) and wasn't working our 2nd day there. "
ruijin hotel ,"Good Experience Paid 924Rmb for a twin through elong.net. On the second floor in Block 3. Room is large, clean and comfortable. Bathroom includes shower and tub. No problems with noise at all.As others have said, very nice place to stay. Grounds make it very relaxing, and the Chinese restaurant on site is really excellent. Highly recommend that you try it for some very good Shanghainese food.The problems - breakfast as others have said could be better. Getting a coffee refill took too much effort. Internet in the room is an extra 100 rmb a day - this seems excessive to me. Lack of English channels on TV - just CNN and HBO - was also something that could be improved.If you are in Shanghai once, try it. If you just need a clean, centrally located hotel, you can get one for half the price. "
ruijin hotel ,"Beautiful grounds great location! The Ruijin Guest House is located on beautiful grounds -- we stayed in Building 3 (next to Maoming Rd) for 5 nights. Luckily we were on the 4th floor facing into the compound -- otherwise the noise from the clubs/bars across the street would have been bothersome. Staff were nice and mostly helpful -- everyone seemed to speak English actually (no chance to use my Mandarin!). The front desk insisted that we didn't need to reserve a cab for our morning flight, and the next morning it was a little complicated to manage our luggage as we tried to check out (in the main building) and eat a quick breakfast, but it all worked out.The room was spacious, and the bathroom pretty large! We had a shower stall and a huge tub with jets. Some of the facility seemed a little old, but it was mostly clean (although I could see dust on the carpet in the corners of the room). The hotel thoughtfully left insect repellent to be plugged in at night (I needed it -- many mosquitoes in Shanghai!!). The breakfast does leave something to be desired, but the omelette station is fairly good and the traditional rice porridge is good. The Face Bar was pretty cool; unfortunately we didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant...There was plenty to see in the neighborhood around the hotel -- the dumpling place on the corner of Ruijin Rd and Fuxing Rd (across from Starbucks) was delicious! Chinese only menu, but helpful service (if you speak Chinese) -- good cold noodles too. The hotel was also within walking distance to Fuxing Park (and Party World/Cashbox karaoke!). Going west on Fuxing Rd (past Maoming Rd) you can get foot and/or body massages by specially trained blind people for an affordable price -- they seem to be open pretty late. Overall, really liked staying at the Ruijin Guest House! "
ruijin hotel ,"Laidback and comfortable What I liked about this hotel - apart from the fact that it is an oasis of calm in the middle of French Concession Shanghai - was the fact that it was a remnant of the 1930's. Art deco buildings - several of them - set in lovely grounds, surrounded by a high fence. The very trendy bar/restaurant Face is in the grounds (the Thai restaurant I'd highly recommend) as well as a Chinese restaurant, several bars and a cafe. Breakfast was a buffet comprising Chinese food, European breakfast (cold meats etc), fruit, eggs and bacon. (You can't go wrong with an omelet.) The rooms were clean and quiet and nobody disturbed me in the 12 days I was there. I'd definitely go back. "
ruijin hotel ,"Good Experience We only stayed at the Ruijin Guesthouse one night. The hotel and grounds are absolutely stunning! It is truly an oasis in Shanghai. The room was large with nice decor. They offered free bottled water (a necessity).I feel my review is a bit biased because I compared my experience to that of Sihe Hotel in Beijing. I thought everything was really good and would still recommend staying here. My complaints are very minor...The room was clean but the carpet was in need of being washed or changed altogether. This is no way affected my comfort, however.The staff, although very accommodating, weren't as warm and friendly as the staff at Sihe in Beijing. The main complaint I had was the breakfast. I didn't try the Chinese breakfast but the western breakfast was pretty bland as was the coffee. Actually, the western options were very limited. Admittedly, I didn't try the omelet bar. Most people probably wouldn't care about this - I just get really excited about food and expected more.Again, these complaints are very minor. I would truly recommend staying here. The location is great, the rooms are comfortable, and the staff is very helpful. "
ruijin hotel ,"Excellent location lovely service nice rooms We stayed 6 nights at the Ruijin and loved it - it may have had something to do with the free upgrade to a suite (the benefit of arriving late at night) - but it is a truly lovely hotel, and a quiet oasis in the centre of one of the best parts of Shanghai - the French Concession. "
ruijin hotel ,"Fantastic! The Ruijin Hotel is highly recommended if you are looking for something a bit different than the usual tourist hotels. It is set on a sprawling property with magnificent gardens, restaurants and bars. Be sure to ask for a room in the old villa with a garden view. The hotel is located in the French Quarter of Shanghai and is surrounded by lots of funky tapas restuarants and jazz &amp; blues bars. It is away from the tourist crowds, which we found really great. If we wanted to wander around at our leisure and not get hassled, we could do that in the French Quarter. Of course the Bund and other tourist attractions are only a short cab drive away, or if you're up for a walk, it would take about 30 minutes to get to the Bund.There are a number of restaurants and bars located on the grounds of the Ruijin Hotel, and they are great. Faces Bar is a must. It is a great meeting place for a lot of expats living in Shanghai and has a really good feel to it. The Indian Restaurant on the grounds of the Ruijin was excellent also.One word of warning. We had trouble with our credit card when we were there, as the hotel billed the accommodation charges plus an extra $100 USD per day (in case we used the mini-bar?) up front, and the total bill exceeded our credit card limit. The credit card company immediately cancelled our credit card as the hotel tried to put the transaction through 6 times. After many international phone calls we discovered what the hotel was trying to do, but didn't tell us that when we checked in. Anyway, everything was sorted out in the end, but it took quite a few days to get to the bottom of the problem.So apart from the credit card problem, we could not fault the Ruijin Hotel. We highly recommend staying there. "
ruijin hotel ,"Ma-ma Hu-hu (so-so) Stayed for 3 nights and were upgraded to a bigger room (yay!). Decent location, nice environment and interesting from a historical perspective. Ex-presidents (including Nixon) and communist VIP's stayed here (including HoChiMinh). You can still (barely) get a sense of the colonial feeling that must have existed before.There is a good Thai restaurant on the premesis - it's just outrageously expensive for the quality of the food. But still very nice and open late if you arrive late and are hungry.Other than that, this is a truly Chinese hotel - it is managed by one of the biggest state-run Chinese tourist companies. I don't say this to be negative - but for those of us who travel alot in Asia, it means that the western-expectations of service don't exist.For example, some downsides - cleanliness wasn't great, the breakfast was barely edible and overall the service was unprofessional. For example, we waited over 15 minutes to be led to our room after check in, the concierge told me to call the airline myself when I needed to change my flight and many areas of the hotel were in disrepair (or in need of a good wash).If you just need an interesting place to stay and you are a relatively experienced traveler in Asia - give the place a try. However, if you are a new traveler to China or need any sort of service above the norm (whatsoever) then I would opt for a different hotel. Plus, while the location is not bad, it is not within an easy walk to the sites. You'll need to taxi it to and from the hotel in most cases.Overall, nice, but won't be back. "
ruijin hotel ,"Great location and price! Agree with previous good reviews. Booked 7 nights at the Ruijin late October/early November. Used Asiatravel for RMB990 per night incl. breakfast. Room was located in Building No. 3 and was spacious and clean. The beds are hard but you eventually get used to it! The air conditioning did not work, so called housekeeping who promptly arrived within minutes. Unable to fix the aircon, the housekeeping girl called the hotel’s electrician who proceeded to ‘jiggle’ the wires located behind the bedside table. Amazingly, this fixed the aircon! After that, there were a couple of times the aircon stopped working but by jiggling the wires ourselves fixed the problem! Although the staff’s English was pretty limited, they were helpful and we got by with a lot of sign language.The Ruijin provides a card containing the major Shanghai attractions written in English and Chinese characters which is essential for non chinese speakers for taxi travel. The maps of Shanghai do not use consistent street names so we used a combination of the local tourist maps and our guidebook maps to get around.Location is awesome. Building No. 3 is located next to the South Maoming Rd exit. There are 2 convenience stores located on the corner of South Maoming Rd and Central Fuxing Rd for basic supplies. There are plenty of places to eat around the area, which are frequented by the locals, and are clean and cheap!! Armed with an excellent mandarin language travel book with chinese characters, we got by with 2 fantastic steaming hot bowls of beef noodles, some type of spicy beef dish and chinese green tea to feed 2 hungry tourists for only AUD6 dollars! (Staff do not speak English and there is no English menu.) Check out the food places located next to the dumpling shop on the corner of Ruijin No. 2 Rd (Ruijin Er Lu) and Central Fuxing Rd (Fuxing Zhong Lu). (From memory, it was the dumpling shop, then a chop shop, then the great noodle/hot pot shop (where we ate) and then an Italian restaurant a few doors down on Central Fuxing Rd.) Taxis: So cheap. Caught taxis from South Maoming Rd or from Central Fuxing Rd. The flag fall rate on the taxi meter is RMB11. We found the majority of taxi drivers polite except for one who tried to quote us RMB100 from the Bund to the hotel. The trip to the Bund should only cost roughly RMB25. In most cases we attempted to request our location in Mandarin and failing that would show the hotel card or guidebook with the location written in Chinese. Best place to book tours were not at the hotel but at a place next to the Okura Garden Hotel on the corner of South Maoming Rd and Changle Rd. We found this place from one of the online guidebooks.Overall, our stay was great and we would probably stay again! "
ruijin hotel ,"History and culture with modern facilities Ruijin Guesthouse is otherwise known as RuiJin Hotel. It is a large property with significant historical significance, and yet the rooms are modern, well-appointed, and nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast, including both western and Chinese items, was plentiful, high quality and good, and was included in the price of the room. It's about 1/2 mile from a major shopping area in the French Concession district of Shanghai. "
ruijin hotel ,"Old villa hotel in French concession We stayed 4 nights in a spacious room in the grand building #1 this month. We had no hinder from traffic noise nor loud music at all. The hotel is in an old villa in beautiful gardens in the French Concession. This quarter came as a surprise with its old world charme amidst the busy and noisy metropolis of Shanghai! The hotel gardens are a peaceful oasis. Lights in the room need definitely be improved and the central switch panel is confusing. As in most of the hotels in China, the beds are hard compared to Western standards. The hotel staff tries to do its best, but due to the language problem there is much confusion which may lead to wrong conclusions from both the side of the guest and the staff. We enjoyed our stay and were very glad that we had chosen the Ruijin Hotel although you would expect the staff to have more knowledge of English in a hotel of this category. "
ruijin hotel ,"A little bit of the past We stayed at the Ruijin for 2 nights having decided that we'd like a hotel with a bit of character. The hotel is set in beautiful gardens and was a good choice overall. We stayed in block 2 which looked very grand. My only criticism is that you could hear the very noisy main road which didn't help the jet lag. The room was large, though quite bare. It was fairly good value for money and is in a good location in the French Concession "
ruijin hotel ,"Indifferent service broken infrastructure great location For our third visit to Shanghai we chose the Ruijin Guesthouse for its superb location -- a park-like setting in the French Concession -- but moved out after the first night of a three-night stay. Although we had booked a king-bed room through Expedia (we had this in writing), upon arrival we were told we had a two-twin-bed room. The staff had to be cajoled into giving us a king: this took a few too many steps and too much time. Finally, the room looked nice, but we were to discover a myriad of problems: the internet connection did not work; we couldn't read in bed because the bedside lights were too dim; the club next door pounded out deep bass deep into the night; the bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were cheap rubber models. The staff couldn't fix the internet connection and were clearly sniggering at us over our request for feather pillows; their English was extremely limited compared to other hotels in Shanghai.Too bad because with a little care the hotel could be wonderful. Stay only if location is all that matters to you. "
ruijin hotel ,"Shanghai in Sept 06 My husband and I stayed at the Guesthouse for 2 nights, so didn't really get a full view of the service provided but from what we saw we would stay there again. We were in No 3 Building which is next to a busy nightlife area, but to be honest it didn't stop either of us sleeping but the two nights were just after our journey from the UK so we were pretty tired from that. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Big bed with a good solid mattress. Nice big marble bathroom with separate shower cubicle. Liked that fact that the hotel left complimentary bottles of water in the room - only hotel to do so in our 2 week visit to China. We had breakfast in the main restaurant overlooking a lovely water garden. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Good selection on offer both western and chinese. Gardens are nice to stroll around at night. There was a wedding on in a marque so the gardens were lit up nicely. Other than that, the wedding party didn't bother us - but the porter told us that they had had 5 wedding parties the day before so not sure how that would have affected us. The only small grip that we would have was that they wouldn't let us go to our room ourselves after checking in and had to wait for the porter to arrive with a golf cart which took about 15 mins as he had just taken another set of guests to their rooms. But a very small issue - it was nice to sit and calm down after the mad taxi journey in from the airport!!! "
ruijin hotel ,"Great location for a great hotel My wife and I stayed here from 11 to 16 June on the basis of tripadvisor reviews. The location of the hotel in the old French consession is terrific. We walked to the Bund a couple of times but it is a long, though interesting, walk so we mainly used the underground which is a few blocks away. Our room was on the west side of the park in the building closest to Maoming Naniu (lane) so we could head the drum beats from the nearby nightclub at night. It did not stop us from sleeping. The room was huge and well appointed with a wonderful spa to wash off the dust from walking around the city streets. The grounds are beautiful and a great contrast to the bussle of the nearby streets. There is a good tapas bar a few steps along the lane from the west entrance. Beer prices there are high so go in the happy hours before dinner. The Thai restaurant in the hotel is written up as one of the best in Shanghai. The service there is absolutely first class but we did not order well and found dishes like the soft shelled crab to be too much of the same thing. It is expensive for Shanghai...about $125 for two of us, but the bottle of wine was a significant part of the bill. Breakfast is served in a central one story building with lovely views into the gardens. Plenty of nice food to choose from however be prepared for a wait if you want something cooked especially for you. We found the staff very obliging and friendly. There seem to be more staff than guests so there is a lot of standing around.We will certainly recommend this hotel to any of our friends travelling to Shanghai "
ruijin hotel ,"Great Hotel BUT.... I stayed at Ruijin Guesthouse for 4 nights; the location is excellent, it's in a park with beautiful bars and restaurants, my room was HUGE, it was in building number 3.BUT: the staff can barely speak English (I'm not even english-speaking, I am Italian), the only people who spoke some words were the girls at the reception; I had some problems with air-con, and they sent me twice people that could not speak one word of english, so I could not explain what my problem was, or if I tried, they would not understand me. In the rooms there's a remote control near the bed that controls everyting, lights, air-con, tv, radio(didn't work), and it's quite complicated to figure out how it works. One night I woke up in the middle of the night because all the lights had gone on suddelny by themselves..! Quite scary feeling.. This was my first time in Shanghai, so I haven't stayed in another hotel, but for sure the staff at Ruijin don't make any effort to be a little nice to guests.Right now I am in Bangkok, and it's completely another matter, even if also here people speak a little english...They're just SO kind;-) "

ruitai jingan hotel ,"Good hotel Good hotel, good price, good location.The only problem is the smell of the restaurant. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Excellent location large rooms The location was too good to be true. Barely a minute's walk from the West Nanjing Road metro station. We took the Maglev train from Pudong airport, changed to the metro line, got off at West Nanjing Rd station, and walked to the hotel. The same in reverse while departing. The short distance from the metro station, and the central location of the West Nanjing Rd area itself, meant far less time commuting to anywhere. This was the most important requirement as a tourist.The rooms were quite large and comfortable. There were no instructions on how to set the lock on the safe, and it took several visits of housekeeping people before even they could decipher it ! The air-conditioning was a bit on the warm side. Otherwise, found the staff very helpful, and enough people at the front desk spoke English. Exchange rate offered by the hotel for currency exchange was also good. Whenever requested, they checked out show timings, ticket availability etc for us on the phone, and helped us.The breakfast was average. My only grouse is that I had booked this place months in advance at 580 Rmb/night for 4 nights. A week before going there, I noticed that the internet quoted rates had dropped below this price. When I told the hotel about the same, and requested for a reduction, they refused (the same happened at our Hong Kong hotel, he reduced the price by much more than what we asked for).Otherwise, we found the hotel clean, and would consider staying here again. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Great location average hotel The hotel has a fabulous location just off West Nanjing Road and 50 metres to a tube line. I cannot think of a better location in Shanghai to base your trip, there are lots of restaurants nearby and the best street for shopping in Shanghai (if you are a women that is) starts 50 yards from the hotel (MaoMing Road). For this reason and the very cheap price of the hotel it is certainly worth considering especially if you plan to be out exploring the city and not spending a lot of time at the hotel. The hotel is okay the rooms are clean but slightly worn out, ours had a few marks on the walls and the towels were a bit worse for wear etc but it passed my wife's bed linen and toilet inspection so it must have been clean. We had a large room with sofa and desk. The airconditioning was poor it was really just a fan system which was not great at night when the room became quite stuffy.The staff were okay but didn't speak great English. The breakfast was poor, to the point that on 3 of the 5 mornings we opted to go out to the excellent cafes just outside the hotel and pay for breakfast. I wouldn't worry too much about this as a good breakfast from the bakery across from the hotel can be had for a couple of pounds. The lobby is small and there are no amenities apart from a small business centre with cheap internet access.Overall the hotel is okay, but it has the advantage of being very cheap compared to most Shanghai hotels and has a wonderful location. Arrange transport in advance if arriving by train, as it is impossible to get a taxi and most car won't know the hotel or street. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,Stay here if its only a bed you want for the night I booked a triple room and found two 1 1/2 size beds when we arrived so we requested another bed which we had done this in other hotels previously. As this bed took up too much space we asked for it to be removed and good job we did because it was at an additional cost but I was told this after 2 nights even though it was booked as a triple room! We were only informed of this because we were annoyed with the staff again because the room was booked as a triple including breakfast but we were only given breakfast vouchers for 2 people and told to pay extra if the third person wanted it! So be careful as you may book one thing but not get it and be charged extra for things without them informing you. Also the staff are not friendly or helpful and speak very little English and the restaurant waitresses speak no English at all!! The lobby constantly smelt like sewage for the 4 days I was there. The room was a good size though but the bathroom was the size of a small en-suite. The location is good very close to Nanjing Road. This hotel is good for someone who only wants a place to sleep and is not fussed about the service they get as it is not a very good one. 
ruitai jingan hotel ,"OK place beware of some things Great location (line 2 door 4) on nice walking street with plenty of shopping, clean, and room good value. Close to all the high end shoppes. However beware the following: The hotel is on master air condition system. You are only hot if the management says you are hot. The interior rooms (no windows) have no A/C and are extremely stuffy when A/C is off, quite uncomfortable. Also... breakfast included is quite lousy food, just greasy fatty stuff and overall poor quality, not worth eating in my opinion, even for free. For the $$ ((about 460 RMB) a great location and OK place, internet worked great and was included. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"If only the toilet flushed... This hotel would get rave reviews from me and my husband if it wasnt for the toilet situation. Let me preempt that by saying that a working toilet is essential to us when we stay in a hotel - if that wasnt important, we would have just gone to a campsite.They put us in this &quot;matrimonial room&quot; and the toilet didnt flush. We stayed a total of 4 nights in the hotel and after the 2nd night, we asked to change rooms and they were able to give us a new room, which was great. The toilet in this room flushed slowly but it did its job but it did stop working on our last day there. But we were already leaving so we didnt bother complaining about it. They have issues with their plumbing for sure. This was in November 2008 so they might have fixed it by now.There were a lot of good things about this hotel. Breakfast was nice and hearty; we were a hop and a skip away from a subway stop and surrounded by little restaurants and mall and fast food places. The staff were pretty accomodating and friendly, and our hotel rate was pretty cheap - around 50 USD a night. So like I said, this would be a stellar hotel if it wasnt for the toilet. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Good hotel but ask yourself what's more important--proximity to metro or comfortable bed? POSITIVES: very convenient/close to MTR, nice location, cleanNEGATIVES: most excruciatingly uncomfortable and hard bed I have ever slept on, somewhat thin walls, slow internet accessBOTTOM LINE: good for 1 night stay if you are extremely tired, so close to public transport, and good fried dumplings near Yang's "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Ruitai is a hem Initially, I wanted to stay somewhere close to the Bund. I am so pleased that I didn't; the Bund is dirty and crawling with people.I booked the Ruitai because it was situated close to the West Nanjing metro stop on line 2 (it's just around the corner to the left), which is just two stops from the East Nanjing metro stop, the closest to the Bund, and one stop from People's Square, the main interchange for lines 1 and 8. From W Nanjing to E Nanjing costs 3 Yuan.The hotel is starting to show signs of age, scuffed furniture and slightly marked carpet; however, the rooms are large and very spacious (I booked a deluxe room for USD80 breakfast included). As is to be expected in Chinese hotels, the bed is firm plus but is super king sized. Staff are both friendly and helpful.The bathroom is fully equipped with toiletries and a shower over bath. There is also a small fridge in which to stash your food and drink. And on the subject of drink, if you're a wine drinker, Marks and Spencer have opened up a store on W Nanjing Road just around the corner from the Ruitai - walk out of the hotel, turn right into Taixing Rd and then right again into Nanjing Road, walk about 200m and there is M&amp;S. In the food department they have a small offering of well-priced wines. As for food, turn left out of the hotel and head to the end of the mall – Starbucks is one of the last stores on your left. Cross Shimen #1 Rd and continue down Wujiang Lu until you see on the left hand side the yellow sign of Yangs. There are two, go to the one furtherest away. Here you can get the best fried pork dumplings in all of Shanghai. Go to the cashier and tell her how many you want, pay then join the queue. As a guide, four are more than ample for dinner and at 4 Yuan total, that’s cheap eating.Shen’s Restaurant on the second level of the hotel is so so but cheap. If you don’t speak Mandarin, they will find an English speaking person to guide you through the menu. I had some kind of chicken hotpot with rice and a 500ml bottle of beer for 49Yuan. Downside, the chicken was laden with bones.All in all, great location and more than adequate lodgings. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Wonderful and Convenient We weren't too sure what to expect of the hotel based on the extremely cheap rate posted and some mixed reviews we read. However, we went in open minded and were extremely pleased with our experience. We arrived at the hotel after a long train ride from Beijing. After lugging our bags through the Shanghai train station and a couple minor detours, we found ourselves at the exit of the West Nanjing Road subway stop. There was some construction going on so it was a little difficult trying to figure out where the hotel was. Once we found a street sign we were on our way and about one short block later we were at the hotel.The staff was extremely friendly and spoke much more English than others we had encountered on our trip. We arrived at 8am (long before check-out) and the staff was more than willing to help us out. They checked us in in advance, let us eat breakfast in the hotel (it was included with the room) and stored our luggage while we explored the city. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon, we were told we could go to our room and it was MUCH nicer than anticipated.The king sized bed was probably one of the cleaner, more inviting beds I've ever seen in a hotel (at least in hotels within this price range) and the size of the room was pretty overwhelming. We had a huge TV, plenty of room to run around (not that we were running around) and a sitting area with a desk, chair, armchair AND ottoman! Another perk -- we opened the shades and realized we were in a corner room with a huge wall of windows! Granted, it wasn't the best view (who really enjoys a view of a city alley anyway), but it was something.The bathroom was immaculate and we had complimentary bottles of water and some nifty disposable slippers. Everything was clean and the staff was very prompt in their services. We called the front desk one day about laundry service and almost immediately after hanging up the phone, someone was at our door waiting to take the bag.One thing I found a bit odd...we left the room one night for about an hour around 6 or so to get food. We came back and the bed was made and our breakfast vouchers were on the nightstand. A bit creepy, but we weren't missing anything. The jury's still out on whether or not this was a good or bad thing. One thing I must add: each room has a little LED display outside that says whether or not you are in the room (you have to keep your key in a slot in order to power anything in the room). So maybe the staff was just being nice? "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Good location I would recommend it I booked the Ruitai Jingan hotel because of its location: close to the city center (a 15 minute walk takes you to the People's Square and Shanghai Museum), and extremely close to a subway station (with very good connections to all destinations in Shanghai: I really recommend using the subway). I had the impression that I received good value for my money: a nice and large room, a clean hotel, and a staff that answered the (few) questions I had. Breakfast, which was included in the room price, was very good: a wide choice of (hot) items, a salad bar, and bread with marmelade was available. The only disadvantage I had was the location of my room (not a city view), but I didn't really mind that since I was only on my room to sleep. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,Very dated and tires This hotel was part of a package sorted out by our toour operator as a part of an organised &quot;China Excursion&quot; package. This was by far the worst hotel I have stayed in for a very long time. The hotel is nice looking from the outside and when all said and done the rooms were large tidy &amp; comfortable (except for the mosquito's). The view over a stagnent river wasn't so hot. We had booked a &quot;superior&quot; room and were given a basic room because they were decorating the superior rooms. That I could have accepted but the staff didn't tell us we weren't getting what we booked. One of the reception staff demanded a deposit before we were even welcomed to the hotel and manners seem few and far between. Our representative who picked us up for a tour the following morning even said that this hotel was so far out they didn't normally pick people up there ..... in fact when we finally obtained a map from reception the hotel wasn't even on it. The buffet breakfast was ok but served in a &quot;ballroom&quot; that had seen better days. Down a sweeping staircase only to find that the carpet and table cloths were frayed. The service was so so when the staff could be bothered to stop chatting to each other and assist guests. The piped music in the halls that seemed to start at stupid o'clock was only ever the BeeGee's or Abba and I would liken this hotel to a 1970's throwback. The hotel information stated that there was a safety deposit box in every room .... this is NOT the case and you would have to use reception. The outside areas were tidy and clean but positionally it was too far away from &quot;anything&quot; to be a consideration for our next visit.The staff badly need some customer training and how to smile would be top of my wish list. 
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Good location Stayed for 3 nights in May 2007 at Ruitai Hotel in Shanghai. The location was excellent, just across the subway station and very close to the west part of Nanjing street. We payed 80 USD/ room/night including tax and breakfast.The room we got was very big and had a wonderful king sized bed. Large windows, nice furniture and complimentary mineral water daily.Just two minuses: the first one - opposite the hotel there was a huge building in construction and it was pretty noisy from 6 AM to 7 PM and the second one - toilet was broken, having water running on the bathroom floor. As long as we stayed there it was not repaired, the cleaning lady just putting a towel to absorb the water.Breakfast was ok, having both Chinese and western food. Reception staff speaks English.As the second minus was just our bad luck, I recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice location in the centre. You can get easily to/from Pudong airport there using the Maglev train and then the subway no. 2 (West Nanjing / Shimen Rd station). "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Great location great hotel Great hotel in a very handy location in the city centre - right next to Metro station and so very easy to get about to all the sights. Room was amazing - huge with big bed - and very good value, we paid about £38 per night for the room. Breakfast was included in the tarif and there was a good selection of both Chinese and Western food. Staff were friendly and helpful. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Good location but I expect more from a Ritz Carlton I chose this hotel because I like Ritz Carltons, and to be near my business travel appointment.The room was fine enough - spacious with traditional/Asian furnishing, excellent housekeeping, etc. that you expect from a Ritz.. I get a little annoyed when a hotel at this price charges for internet access.I usually look forward to at least one meal in the Dining Room signature restaurant whenever I stay at a RC, but this one was a disappointment. The food was good enough, but my experiences at other RC's were more impressive. At these prices, I'd like to be impressed, not just satisfied.The public rooms are fine enough, but felt a little more corporate and austere than I prefer.The take-away: there's not much to complain about, but I'd prefer staying at the nearby Pudong Shangri-La. The guest rooms are a little nicer at the Ritz, but I prefer the ambiance of the Shangri-La and will return there on my upcoming visit back to Shanghai. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"Pleasantly Surprised - central and convenient We were looking for a hotel to stay in that was conveniently located near a subway station, as our plan was to head to Pudong Airport by train in the morning. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a higher class room than our reservation was originally made for. This was a pleasant surprise. Our room was wonderful and clean, large with huge windows that overlooked Nanjing Lu (though somewhat noisy, yet typical for this area). The rooms had complimentary water, free wired internet access, and you received a free hot breakfast (generally a combination of Chinese and western fare). Staff even spoke English (though limited) which was great.Outside, you don't have to walk more than a block to get to the subway station on the #2 line. This is one stop west of the People's Park Station. You will find many food/drink options from Starbucks to local street fare in the shopping alley outside the hotel. Fun shopping in these alleyways! Plus, Nanjing Lu is just outside the hotel, and you have all of your more upscale shops along this road, if that's what you prefer. The Portman is only about 2 blocks away. I suppose we had such a pleasant experience because we were not expecting much, and received much more than we anticiapted. Regardless, this hotel was a great find for the location, and we are definitely returning in the future. "
ruitai jingan hotel ,"A great hotel Stayed for 7 nights - hotel is in great location on the No 2 subway line (Shi Men Rd stop (now known as West Nanjing) is only two minutes walk away)Street market from 1400-2100 in the mall outside the hotel.Had a room on level 7 (11 floors) - king size bed - nice and firm.Shampoo, soap, bath foam, tooth brushes &amp; bottled water provided - and replaced each day.Ate breakfast in the hotel each morning - full buffet with plenty of choice.Used internet service which is situated on level 11 - 5 RBM for 15 mins.Currency exchange at front desk - same rate as at bank. But be aware that no exchange is offered on Sunday. "

salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,In the heart of Huangpu District In the heart of Huangpu District. Easy access to all the interesting points. 
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Great Location highly recommend. Hotel is very clean and you get free internet in the room. We stayed at the business suite and it came with a computer as well, not sure about the other rooms. The decor is very over the top chinese style furnishing. Bed is quite comfortable. The large bathtub is a small plus.The restaurant is below expectations. Definitely do not count on great food if you plan on dining in the hotel. I'd suggest you take the short walk to Nanjing Rd, where there's plenty to choose. We tried the breakfast buffet and would definitely not recommend it. It cost RMB$90 (around $13 US) and it was terrible. You can get way better food elsewhere for a fraction of that.Hotel is very well located. Most of the main Shanghai attractions are within walking distance. Nanjing Rd (10-15 min. walk), Bund (15-20 min. walk), YuYuan Garden (20-30 min. walk), People square (15-20 min. walk). The Nanjing Rd East Subway station is only 5-10 min. walk and you can take the subway to almost any location. Getting in from Pudong Int'l Airport, we took a taxi and came out to RMB$186, and about 75 min ride. If you don't have much luggage, it's faster to take the MagLev Train to the Longham station (RMB$50), then take the Subway Metro 2 (RMB$4) to the Nanjing Rd East station, walk up exit 3 and turn left as you exit the station. Then just walk down about 3-4 blocks (about 10-15 min.) and the hotel will be at the intersection with Guangdong rd. Definitely recommend this hotel for the price. BTW, we paid around $79 / night. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Reasonable location Stayed for 4 nights in executive suite on 25th floor. Any commentary has to be aware of the rating and for 5 star one can get a little picky. We booked online and paid about US$500 for the 4 nights total.Staff are friendy for a Chinese run hotel (which is often not the case).On arrival we were ushered to the 31st florr for VIP checkin which was a little strage as there was nobody waiting in the foyer. But all went smoothly and efficiently to get us into the room in super quick time.It has two older style TVs, nice big bed and separate TV / coimputer / louge area. No that big but quite sufficient. The PC provided has reasonable speed for basic work and quite functional. I found mysilf using it rather then the laptop. Reasonable view through the fog (nobody likes calling it pollution as such).Make sure you bring your own shampoo as both of us found teh one small container supplied was worse then soap. They also have no conditioner supplied which was also a little annoying given the bad quality of the shampoo.there is a local English paper in the foyer which is worth a quick read.It was impossible to get a rate online that included breakfast so the first morning we did try it out and it was quite OK but we could not get out heads around the 90RMB price tag. There are many cafes and restaurants nearby where you can experionce some local Chinese flavour for much much less.Its a short wallk to the walking street (East Nanjing) which is worth the trip and there are many good restaurants around there also. Don't jump into the ones at street level which will be overpirced but venture up a few levels for reasonable value and good quality.Otherwise you can grab a taxi (min 12RMB) which will zip (except for the incredible traffic) you to the other major sites of old town (fairly close), Pudong, etc.Overall I would stay here again asl long at the rates were at a 4 star level. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Greta Location - good value Stayed at Salvo many many times and whilst the hotel is getting a bit tired the location next to the Bund and Nanjing Road cannot be beaten for the price.Try and get an upgrade to upper floor as the views can be superb. Don't expect large rooms - but they are big enough Excellent top floor bar, but don't bother with the hotel restaurants as they leave a lot to be desired. Execption to that is the Japanese on the gound floor. Staff are pretty good and helpful, but not overly so "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,Excellent Hotel - 5* low priced hotel + Excellent location Stayed at the Salvo Hotel on September 24. I stayed in a business queen suite which consists of a bedroom and an office room. Excellent hotel with an oriental influence. Located 2 minutes away from Nanjing Road. Rates very affordable compared to other hotels in Shanghai (paid approximately $100 USD). Will be my hotel for all future trips in Shanghai. 
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Great location. Stayed here for two nights. Rooms were large - actually a business suite but very reasonable - booked through Expedia. Big bonus was the internet available in the room. Bathroom very clean not overly large but separate shower - very fancy and a corner bath. Furniture a little old fashioned in appearance with a slight Chinese flavour (well it is China), two TV'S. Were on the 17th floor with a great view of the river. Location was super, just a few minutes walk to The Bund (unfortunately a building site due to Expo 2010) and Nanjing Road. Staff were polite, courteous and informative, particularly the bell boys. Great value for money in Shanghai. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Good value great location The Salvo Hotel (what a fantastic name!) is very well located in central Shanghai and is very close to the Bund and the Old Town. It is a local Chinese-owned and operated hotel and thus guests shouldn't expect Western-style decor - there were lots of gold carp in my room! Having said that, all the staff I met spoke good English. Service in general was fast and efficient. The room had all the basics, CNN, and a very good internet connection. Overall, I would stay here again. Its good value for money and is very well located. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Good hotel I would recommend it to a good friend Loved the hotel, good English speaking staff, location close to many touristic places (although it is located in an old area in Shanghai, maybe if you want a really modern place you could stay across the river in Pudong area).Nice suite with a living room and a separate bedroom. Big bath tube and separate shower with lots of controls. We had a computer (yes, they provide a computer for guests) with free internet (a MUST have in hotels nowadays and specially in China)!The western restaurant menu was not so attractive (and a little expensive compared to China standards). I would recommend getting things from the room service instead: more options and cheaper! Also, check the best prices for the drinks from the room service and the minibar, they are different!We booked this hotel through the booking.com website and got the VIP check-in on the 31st floor. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Excellent place to stay in the middle of Shanghai I loved this hotel! I was surprised to see a few bad reveiws, and all I can say is that our stay was wonderful. The location is perfect; near the bund and all the shopping. Lots of little alleys to explore and wander through. Easy walking distance to many places of interest.Our room was actually a suite, with separate bedroom with a Bund view. The furniture was not exactly my style, but it was newish, clean and seemed to fit the mood. We had water in the room daily, along with a variety of teas. The bathroom was modern with a very cool shower and separate bathtub. And the best, of course, was a computer with free internet in the room! We had no problem at all with the staff. The wait help in the buffet restaurant were not particularly friendly, but they were busy helping a large number of people. I enjoyed the variety at the breakfast buffet. The fruit was fresh and seasonal, including lychee, watermelon, longon, and others. They also had a nice cheese platter, along with Chinese Juk, and traditional western-style food. All in all, I would stay there again with no hesitation. I thought it was a great room for the price. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Worse In Asia So Far This is by far the worse hotel we have stayed since traveling through Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai. We originally had reservations for three nights and after the first few hours immediately decided to change our reservations and switch hotels. We requested an early check-in and were told no problem. When we arrived after a 9 hour train ride, we were told we would have to wait until noon. Ridiculous. The rooms are old and worn. The bathroom is very small and dirty. For lunch we ordered room service and the girl did not speak any english. It took 30 minutes of calling back and forth to get our order in. I called the Assistant Manager for help and he did not do anything except have the girl who spoke no English call us back. Then when I called the Assistant Manager again he said he could not help because he was eating lunch and was busy! We then wanted to go to Cloud 9 at the Grand Hyatt. When we went to the conceirge to get a taxi, we waited for five minutes while the employees were goofing around. Then we asked how much the taxi would be and how long of a ride. We were told over 30RMB and it would take 20 minutes. He set us up with a taxi and told the driver to charge us 35RMB, no meter. The taxi ride took 10 minutes. On our return taxi trip, we used the meter and it only cost 15RMB. Ridiculous.The breakfast buffet is disgusting, the fruit is not fresh. The furniture is worn. We were shown to a dirty table that was actually being used by another return guest. Horrible.This has been the worse hotel experience ever. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Anyone that likes this hotel must only have experience staying at cheap motels back home and do not know better.Also the high-speed internet takes about five minutes to load a web page. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Loved it great location staff very helpful free internet in every room! We were pleasantly suprised when we arrived at teh Salvo as it was a fairly 'cheap' option compared to others in shanghai. Location is great and our room overlooked the bund, great view. ROOM;Its very traditional in its design lots of dark wood and gold, very nice, our room had a big bathroom with a corner bath andf great shower, hairdryer was nice and powerful as well (normally a problem for me with having long hair to dry) Each room has a desk and sofa and chairs, 2 tvs, computer with free internet which is an excellent resource. HOTEL: Concierge very heplful with luggage, taxis, directions etc and speak quite good english. Business centre in there were we booked train tickets, commission was a lot and you could def get cheaper but we just found it convenient.. Girl in there was pretty rude though. December seems to be time for renovations in China as yet again there was work going on and some banging/noise. Then on the 2nd of 3 nights they made us move rooms which i was not happy at all but they did upgrade us. (I wouldnt recommend payong for an upgrade, not much difference at all, just couple more freebies and a table and chairs)LOCATIONGreat, you can easlily walk to the Bund area or taxis are very cheap. Shopping is great at the markets leave room in your case! M on the BUnd fabulous restuarant you must go, WEstern food, but very very good, reasonably priced (£21 for 3 course meal on new years day) and the concierge cannot do enough for you, service was impeccable.

salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Perfect Choice After being in the last two year in two other different and cheaper accommodations, I decided to book this hotel since my &quot;boss&quot; come with us and wanted a more comfortable hotel.After some search, and reading the TA reviews as usual, I decided to book this hotel since it seemed to be the best quality/price ratio for that period.I must say that I was happy with my choice.. I don't want to repeat the general description of the hotel itself, so, as usual, I'll write my &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;THE GOOD1) Location - it is 5 minutes (two blocks) away from Nanjing Road E and 10 minutes from the Bound. Placed in a small and safe one-way road, traffic noise is not present at all!2) Rooms - clean, medium space. We booked higher floor rooms, both single and double, and the result was a nice view, especially during the night.3) Breakfast - we were very happy about it - plenty of stuff, promptly refilled, both European and Asian style.4) Room maid - perfect!! Not disturbing you not requested, cleaning room in a short time while you are out..THE BAD1) The lobby bar - overpriced for being in China. A Tea/Coffee is offered at 5 euro each.. also the last floor bar, with live music, has very high prices.. but.. you should know before entering it..2) The crowded check-out - a long queue is present every morning, and you can take about 20 minutes to process it. This because this hotel is used by different &quot;tourist group&quot;, so if you are just behind them, you just need to be patience!3) Bath tube: even if provided with an &quot;old-style&quot; plastic curtain, (and using it in the right way), the water was flooding everywhere on the floor. Maybe, placing a fixed glass protection, at least at the beginning of the tube, would solve this problem.. THE UGLY1) Ok, I faced some problems: I asked the receptionist for a late check-out, and the answer was &quot;you book through an internet website, you should contact them to modify the reservation&quot;.. what?? just for a late check-out? Well, since I'm stubborn, I go again the day later, and the receptionist told me &quot;No problem, I can do it for you&quot;.. so.. It was a matter of the girl at the desk..2) Hotel Travel agency - I had to book two internal flights and the train.. ok, they did it, but they were really impolite. They also tried to overprice the transfer to the airport with their van. As usual: trade trade trade - you are in China!! Pay attention: if you are going to pay with Credit Card (as I guess 90% of you usually do), the Travel Agency will make you pay about 5% commissions. As you can see, very few bad things.. nothing compared to the nice time we spent in a clean and friendly hotel. The Concierge was very useful, suggesting us 4 different restaurant which was one better than the other!!I strongly recommend you this hotel for the location, the clear rooms, the good service and the prices.. an independent hotel brand which has nothing less compared to more famous (and expensive) international brands. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,Great Location for Shanghai This was a great hotel with a super location. The room itself is very large and clean. Loved the fact I had a computer in my room for my personal use. Water provided daily which was a nice touch. Many places are easy to walk to from here or take a taxi - they are pretty cheap!! I would stay here again and recommend to anyone. 
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Comfortable but a little bit boring The Salvo is a five star hotel, living up to all expectations in both rooms and service. It's a little bit boring, compare to the west brand hotels as Park Hyatt, Radisson and Westin in Shanghai. If the Salvo is much less expensive then these, I would stay here again. The location is good in Huangpu next to the Bund and the shopping street. Great breakfast in the restaraunt at top floor with a nice view. Expensive but nice top-bar, where we was the only guest, with a fantastic view of the Bund and the radio tower. Roomservice was great and was delivered with a smile. Rooms was very spacius and well equipped with everything you need. Large bathroom with bathrobe and slippers, corner tub and shower. Seperate living area and bedroom and stuffed with great amenities. It's not a international hotel and you can feel the chinese management style overall, but it is ok. We had a good stay! "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Overnight Stay I stayed at this hotel for 1 night before catching my return flight home. It is roughly 40 mins to an hour away from the airport and the cost should be no more that 160 rmb. On arrival check in was fine. Nice hotel, i found the corriders sickening hot, no air conditioning until you go to your room.The room was nice and clean, but my bathroom i did not consider to be 5 star rating, as there was some weird stains in the bath, to my dislike.The view was spectacular and the bed was comfortable. I did ask for wake up call for 5am, and did not get this, luckly i was awake......I ate at the japenese resturant and really liked the food.The next day they tried to charge me extra for breakfast, which i had already paid for online so they took the charge off their bill, and i did not even have time for breakfast anyway as i was leaving at 5.45am.Also the taxi to the airport tried to charge me over 360 rmb, so he fiddled with the meter but i gave him 200rmb, ashe made out he didnt understand, but they do.So be careful, always make sure you ask the price beforehand, otherwise they will try and swindle you for every penny, or the best way is to have the exact money and only give them that and say you nt have any more otherwise all taxi drivers will not give you change and make out they have none.Shangai is a great place and the location was more than ideal for shopping and doing tourist things. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Business room in August 2005 I stayed at Savo hotel in August 2005 when it was quite new. We had a business room for two persons. The hotel was nice and clean, and so was the room. One thing which was quite disappointing was that there were no non-smoking rooms or at least that we were told after we asked to be moved to a non-smoking room. Otherwise the room was nice and spacious, although the walls weren`t very soundproof.We used the hotel restaurant once, and the service was really good. Overall the staff was very eager to help. When we visited the bar, and asked for cigarettes, the bartender went to buy it for us from downstairs. Many of the staffmembers didn`t speak very good english, but everything went ok eventually. There were also some people that spoke very good english.It was very hot in August so the location could have a been a bit closer to Nanjing road because walking wasn`t really a pleasure. But it don`t mean it was far away, but if I go to Shanghai again, I will take a hotel closer to main streets. Although the taxis were ridiculous cheap, so we used taxi A LOT. The hotel surroundings weren`t very luxurious, but there were many constructions so I suppose the area could look totally different nowadays.Overall the hotel was very nice place to go back to relax after being harassed all day by all the street sellers and beggers. It was the only place where people didn`t stare and tug from arm. Especially my blue-eyed and blond husband seemed to a sight to many people in Shanghai, which was quite surprising :D "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Great! Stayed in Salvo Hotel (Zhongfu Shifuhui) for 3 nights in May in a Superior Deluxe Room on 12th floorRoom is excellent with a nice view. A living room (with a tv with tons of channels), Bedroom (with a tv with tons of channels) and a bathroom with a huge bathtub and top range shower facilities.Location is pretty good, only a couple of blocks away from Nanjing RoadStaff are friendly and speak understandable english. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Central Location - godd but not great We stayed at Salvo Hotel for two weeks. The hotel is five star and has western restaurant, local restaurant and japanese rest. The local restaurant i fair priced and has excellent food. We had a baby with us and the staff did not know what to do. Had to ask for babybed and babychair many times. The hotel is centrally located with only a few minutes to the bund, Nanjing road, the old town and subway. Would recommend this hotel if you get a good deal. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Love the Hotel Hate the food We stayed at Salvo Hotel in the executive deluxe rooms for 4 days 3 nights from 19 October to 22 October 2007. Overall the standard of the rooms is above average. However, the hotel staff are not friendly. We noted that the hotel staff do not greet the hotel guests upon arrival at the main door or anywhere in the hotel. Free breakfast is provided at the 31st floor restaurant. However we noted that the service at the 31st floor restaurant is below average for a 5-star hotel. The waitress who collected the breakfast coupons from us each morning was also not friendly. The staff talked quite loudly among themselves. There is no variety in the type of food available. We had the same kind of food for all three mornings. The waiter and waitresses were not attentive. Most of the time we had to raise our hands to request for refills of coffee and tea. The tea that was served came with residue in the teacups !The hotel is conveniently located. Next to the hotel is an Italian restaurant which serves really cheap and tasty Italian food.It closes at 5 am. Check it out ! "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"A real deal! by shadylaw This is my 4th stay at Salvo Hotel and so far every visit has been pleasant. The staff can speak good english. It is 4 blocks away from the nanjing pedestrian walk. By taxi, you can get around town within minutes. The price is very reasonable compared to hotels in the Nanjing Pedestrian area (too over rated plus too touristy for me). "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Good tourist hotel but how can the restaurant not serve xiao lung bao? My family and I stayed at the Salvo Hotel for 3 nights near the end of June 2007. We booked out three rooms as part of a package tour of China.The Salvo Hotel is a very nice tourist hotel that is located near Nanjing Road East (a pedestrian mall shopping district that is lit up like Vegas at night) and the Bund. In regards to other tourist sites in Shanghai, I cannot speak to the distance from the hotel, as we were picked up/dropped off by the tour bus and I did not really pay attention to the time or distance between sites. However, Nanjing Road East and the Bund are definitely within a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel (or shorter, depending on the speed of your stroll). Also depending on the facing of your room, you can get a great view of the Bund and/or the Pu Dong district (where the distinctive looking Oriental Pearl TV Tower is located).Some specific notes about the Salvo:1.) As mentioned above, we booked out 3 rooms (1 queen-bed room and 2 double-bed rooms). All rooms were 2-room suites with one room being an office/sitting area (with a desk and chair, couch, and tv) and the other being the actual bedroom. However, the queen-bed room also came equipped with a computer that was hooked up to the Internet. The double-bed rooms did not. There was no charge for us to access the Internet via the computer in our queen-bed room. (As a result, we switched one of our double-bed rooms to a queen-bed room so that we can have twice the Internet access!)2.) Unlike other hotels that we stayed at in China, the beds at the Salvo were not the &quot;typical&quot; rock-hard, super firm mattresses. Instead, the bed mattresses felt more like bed mattresses you'd find in U.S. hotels.3.) As some other reviewers have mentioned, the bathtub/shower setup is a little odd (not bad, just odd). The easiest way to explain it is to picture a large shower stall with a triangle-shaped bathtub that is in the far corner of the stall and takes up 2/3rds of the stall space. Then, closest to the shower doors, is a multi-headed shower structure with jets coming from the top and the middle. I've attached a picture of this in my review. Overall, the shower works just fine and none of us had any problems with temperature, water pressure, or anything else. None of us tried the tub, so I can't speak to how they are.4.) The breakfast area can get VERY crowded during peak hours (seemingly around 8am). The area is set up with only a handful of small 2- and 4-person tables and a large number of 10+ person round tables and seating is first-come first-serve. As a result, when it's crowded, be prepared to share tables. Also, if you are a mid- to large-sized group, you may find it a little difficult to all sit together. We were a 6-person group and one morning it took us about 10 minutes of hovering before we could claim 6 open seats at the same table.5.) The breakfast buffet was average in comparison with other hotel breakfast buffets that we have had in China. While it had about a 50/50 mix of Chinese and Western food items (including an omelet bar), there wasn't too much overall variety in food. The food itself was fine, and we had nothing to complain about.6.) The hotel restaurant does NOT serve xiao lung bao (the steamed pork and/or pork/crabmeat buns that Shanghai is so famous for). For me, this is an absolute egregious offense... especially at 11pm at night and you want to order them for room service. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Passable experience I stayed at the Salvo for 5 nights this month. The room was comfortable and served our needs sufficiently. I appreciated the provision of unlimited amounts of bottled water as the tap water in Shanghai tastes really bad. However, there was no tea provided, well, other than Chinese tea, so bring your own if you need regular tea. The hotel is located about a 10-minute walk to the Nanjing Rd East subway station which is convenient enough if you don't mind walking. I travelled with my mother and so this really wasn't the best of hotels if you wanted to take the subway. A slightly more expensive option is to take a taxi (11 RMB vs 3 RMB), which is what we ended up doing most of the time. I found that this was the best way to travel most of the time as many of the places of interest for us, namely Yu Gardens, Lujiabang Fabric Market, were not within walking distance. The staff of Salvo were sufficiently polite but not friendly. The concierge could advise on the best options for day-tours to Suzhou and that saved us some of the costs if we went on a packaged tour. The hiccups were that there were no English cable channels on TV and so we really had nothing to do in the night other than be subjected to the miserable screenings of the only English channel on CCTV. I also found the room to have a slightly musty smell of stale smoke , but my mother didn't find that to be a problem at all, so it may just have been my sensitive nose.All in all, a satisfactory stay though I wouldn't choose to stay there again unless I intend to spend a lot of time near Nanjing Lu. My advice would be to stay near a subway station as it is easy to use and the self-service machines provide English instructions for buying tickets. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Choose Somewhere Else To Stay I stayed at the Salvo Hotel in Shanghai, China from June 9, 2007 - June 15, 2007. I want to preface my review by letting you know that I had just stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing which influenced my views on the Salvo Hotel.The Positives:The Salvo Hotel is a few blocks away from the River (which has upscale restaurants and stores) as well as a nice shopping district that does not allow automobiles (I don't remember the name of the district, but go straight out the front door until you hit the shopping). The Salvo Hotel is in a great location. The lounge on the 31st floor has great views of the River and has a good selection of drinks. My group found it to be a good place to hang out in the evening when we did not feel like going out. The rooms were quite spacious, although the two beds in my room were twin sized. There is free internet if you hook up on a hard wire with your laptop from your room. Some rooms (single rooms) have a computer provided. We could not find any networks to hook up to.I liked the sushi place on the first floor, but I am not a sushi connoisseur, so I don't want to give the impression that it was great sushi. Some of my group members that I traveled with did say it was good. It is fairly cheap. If you are into Chinese food, there are a lot of restaurants around the hotel (in walking distance). The shopping district also has McDonalds, KFC &amp; Pizza Hut for the Western inclined food. We saw by the River a lot of non Chinese upscale restaurants (which were expensive). Literally across the street is a small shop that sells drinks for very cheap prices.The Negatives:The breakfast selection was not very good in the &quot;Nice Western Restaurant’s&quot; (actual name) and I ended up eating a &quot;dinner&quot; (veal, rice, bread, watermelon) for breakfast because the choices were not that appetizing. I tried the cereal and had to throw it out because it tasted disgusting. Also, the cook for the eggs liked to add extra ingredients from his body into it, so I stayed away from it. You need to open up every top to the buffet line because the translations are not correct and what you might think a dish is actually something else. There is free Chinese bottled water, and I suggest you take some with you for the day.Although the rooms were fairly big, the bedroom was actually small (there is a sitting room with a desk, couch and TV). The bathroom had a huge bath tub, but the shower, which was not in the bath tub, but right outside of it (using the same &quot;shower door) was extremely small and did not have great water pressure. There is only one sink and only one person can be in it at a time because of how small it is. Outside of the bathroom, there was a wet spot that looked like it had mold on it. As other reviewers have commented on, the rooms and hallways were very dark because of the decor and dark wood.If you do not speak any Chinese, I would suggest you not stay at this hotel. The staff barely speaks English at all and the people who do; do not speak it very well. Another issue I had with the hotel is that they charged me to exchange money where the Ritz did not.While I stayed at the hotel, they took away the English speaking channels (1-6, CNN, ESPN, HBO, STAR, and National Geographic) with no explanation and not ETA on when it would be corrected.Conclusions:They say that this hotel is a 4-5 star hotel and I disagree with it. I think, at best, it is a 2.5 star hotel. In my opinion, the location is about all it has going for it. If you have the money, I would suggest staying at a Western hotel. I don't think by staying at a Western Hotel, you would lose out on any experience of being in China. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Service and price good accomodations left a little to be desired I stayed at the Salvo for three days on a recemt business trip to Shanghai and had a relatively mixed experience. The rooms were quite large and very nicely decorated. The service was very good and there was a computer in the room. The location was excellent, very close to Old Shanhai and other attractions. Negatives about the place were as follows:- rooms were a bit dark and in part due to the sheer size of the large wooden furniture felt a bit cramped.- there was a very strong musty wood smell in my room and the smell was worse in a colleague's room. Not sure what it was, but it kind of smelled like musty oil stain or something.- the internet connection (which you had to pay for) was very very slow, whether you used the in room computer or hooked up a laptop to the ethernet cable.All in all, it was a good experience, but if I had to choose, there are probably better alternatives for the price. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"suiterooms with your own PC This was the greatest room of our journey.First we had a wonderful view of Shanghai at the riverside with the pearltower in front. We slept with open curtains because of the romantic view. We had a suiteroom( Luxe-executive room)withe two TVs and PC with internetconnection, so never a dull moment when we 're returning from strolling around at the nearby Nanjing road and the BundGreat brakfast too, althought the breakfastroom was a little overcrowded when you arrive at normal breakfast time at 8.amOnly complaint is the noisy airco, but overall wonderful stay nearby the main important area. "
salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,"Don't go for ""business twin"" rooms I saw the three positive reviews on tripadvisor, and asked a couple of Chinese people who live in England about the hotel who told me that this must be a very new hotel (allegedly it was built in 2004) I decided to go for Salvo. I booked it through ineedhotel website, a Chinese agent in Beijing that facilitates booking of Chinese hotels for English-speaking customers. The travel agent was very helpful and I had a good feeling about it. I booked a &quot;business twin&quot; room which was the cheapest in the list. But given that it claimed itself to be a five-star hotel, I thought it cannot be bad. I have stayed in three-, four- and five-star hotels in Shanghai in the past, and even three-star hotels were not that bad so I was in for a nice room.When I got to the hotel, the room we were shown to was facing some kind of office that had its door wide open, and two ladies very shabbily dressed were chatting very loudly, and some not-too-appealing music was played very loudly, too. Whenever we went back to the room we had to see those ladies staring at us and hear the loud music. The room was very stuffy, smelled musty. My sister had an allergic reaction to the air, although I was okay. The bathroom smelled like it was not cleaned properly, and the smell reminded us of those public bathrooms in China. And there was no bathtub, only a shower stall. I thought that a five-star hotel (or semi-five-star, as some reviews state) cannot have a room without a bathtub given that normally hotels are ranked according to the kinds of amenities they have. The cheaper room we stayed in at Salvo, allegedly a &quot;five-star&quot; hotel, was shabbier than the three-star hotels (and even newer two-star hotels in Beijing) I have stayed in in China, particularly regarding the smell in the bathroom and the lack of bathtub.I do realize that even five-star hotels in China has some weak plumbing around the bathroom. But the smell and the dinginess of the bathroom was quite unconscionable I went downstairs to ask the receptionist to change the room.But the receptionist who were very friendly when she checked us in suddenly became unable to understand English. I spoke in Chinese, which didn't really help. She basically said you get what you pay for, and she cannot move us to another room unless we add 322RMB to the rate we were paying. I told her that would get me a genuine five-star hotel so I was going to change the hotel. I had booked for six nights so I was hoping she'd agree to change us to a different room. But since she refused, I turned to Expeida.com and booked Jinjiang Hotel, a real five-star (maybe 4.5 to some people). I am glad I did not pay for the whole six nights there, I could leave this hotel after enduring it for one night.The only upside about this hotel is that the porters absolutely refused to take the tip, which used to be the case in all hotels in China ten years ago. But I don't mind tipping the porters when they do carry my bag.The breakfast was mediocre but decent. I saw a head waitress behind the counter spitting into the sink, and she did not seem to realize that it was sort of not nice thing to do in front of people who are eating food. Overall, this hotel is &quot;too Chinese&quot;--good old socialist feel where no one had any concept of service. It's okay if it is dirt-cheap hotel. I'd find even spitting and throwing room keys at the customers somewhat cute. But given that I paid pretty dencent amount of money, I didn't appreciate the sound of spitting in a restaurant and the rough manners of the receptionist(s). It is indeed pretty close to Nanjing Road, but it is not as close as the other reviews claim to be. Having stayed at Peace Hotel, and given that Expedia has an incredible deal on Peace Hotel at least this summer (some rooms much cheaper than Salvo), I'd go for the Peace Hotel if I want a classic Shanghainese feel AND the proximity to Nanjing Road (Peace Hotel is on Nanjing Road).

I only had two little complaints - first, there was a lack of water pressure on the 14th floor, so the shower was more like a trickle. And for some reason, there were no clocks in the room. Two nice televisions, but no clocks. I asked the front desk if we could have one, and they said &quot;the rooms are not equipped for clocks.&quot; Odd.But I would stay there again.

salvo hotel zhongfu shifuhui ,central salvo the 5* salvo hotel was a bargain at us 83 dollars per room per night. the rooms were spotless and had tea and coffee making machines. (take your own tea and coffee - the local stuff is an acquired taste.) there were 2 beds - large single size and a sofa and armchairs.there were several offices on our floor - apparantly it's quite common in china for the hotels to rent out rooms to companies for this purpose. we were in no way disturbed by this. one of our sons lives in shanghai and went to check out several hotels prior to our arrival. this was the only one where the staff were friendly and spoke english and also showed him a room. the bund and nanjing road were within 3/4 blocks.go for a drink in cloud 9 in jiamao tower(pudong)for the view.the business restaurant in the hotel was good value for money although nothing memorable. the beer is much cheaper here thasn in the groundfloor bar. if you cross the street from the hotel there is an abundance of tiny cafes and shops. taxis are very cheap but drivers don't usually speak any english and are reluctant to pick you up. the hotel tells the driver your destination. don't expect to find ant tourist information places; they either move or have been demolished!the street signs are in chinese and english so it makes it easy to navigate.

san want hotel ,"Value for money At only 468 RMB this is a super hotel with big, clean rooms and great service.The breakfast and dinner choice is huge and quality can't be better.A metro station close by makes up for the somewhat out of centre position. "
san want hotel ,"Awesome hotel! Two nights here at the end of a marathon business trip to Hong Kong and China. First timer to Shanghai as well. This hotel is about one year old, and owned by the Want Want snack company- their logo of a funny looking kid is all over everything. All of the drinks and snacks in the room are their product and therefore free. Room was huge- American King bed, desk and chair, sofa and coffeetable, large wardrobe, bath slippers and robes, sunken garden tub, fridge, free broadband (wired). Had room service one night, cheap and quick! Desk staff were excellent and I was overall very, very impressed by the hotel. Note that it it primarily used by business travellers and it is an inexpensive, but lengthy, taxi ride into the proper city centre. Public transport links I understand are excellent but I did not get a chance to use them. There is a 24 hour tiny grocer, alldays, just around the corner, but did not seem to be too much else as far as dining and shopping nearby. But again dining in the hotel was cheap and delicious. Breakfast buffet was very large and international, and included in the room rate. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
san want hotel ,"Elegant with a twist... This is an absolutely first-rate hotel is every respect. The staff was everywhere, offering to be helpful. I had a problem with the Internet access in my room, and someone appeared with a new cable within seconds after I hung up the phone to report it. The room was impeccably clean. The only weird touch: it's apparently owned by a snack-food company, whose mascot adorns everything... a little like a Disney character, but not quite as cute. I can't speak to the location (it was convenient to the Expo center, which is what I was interested in) but it is next to a metro station, and the Shanghai metro is as nice a system as I've seen. The restaurant was quite good. "
san want hotel ,"Best for Mandarin speakers This hotel is clean and spacious, the staff are friendly and helpful and they do a good buffet in the evenings for 120 renminbi. That's the good news. The hotel caters chiefly for chinese tourists and business people, it's located well out of the city centre with no metro link so it's a taxi or a couple of bus rides into town. The staff are helpful but have very limited english so communication was an issue. If you're new to China , like me, you migt be better spending a little more and staying more centrally. "
san want hotel ,"What a rat hole I totally agree with the last review. All I can say is if you decide to go to China, do not stay in anything less than a 5 star. I thought a three star would be our equivalent to a Motel 6 - no way. The A/C did not work well, bathrooms always had mildew and the carpets in the dining area were so dirty, I could only imagine what the cooking area looked like. This hotel needs a major overall. The bedding was clean and they always try to make you happy but I have a problem with dirty walls, carpets and chairs. Shanghai is a great metro place and we were in a hotel at the end of the city where there was very little to walk to. Try to get something close to the Bund. "
san want hotel ,Not a 3 star hotel Just returned from a tour of China and ended our tour staying at the Qianhe Hotel. Not a good experience! Carpet was so dirty and stained both in the rooms and in the halls that we were almsot afraid to walk on it. Rooms were woren and furniture frayed. Advertised bar was a counter in the coffee shop. Only one of the two advertised resteraunts existed and the advertised shops were a shelf in the computer room! We ate breakfast in a dirty old banquet room and when I asked that the empty coffee carafe be refilled I was told &quot;No&quot;. The breakfasts were the worst of our tour. We were told we could cash travellers checks which they would not do until our tour guide intervened. Do not stay at this hotel unless you are really looking for cheap. It is inexpensive but I would advise spending a few more dollars and staying at a hotel where you don't have to be concerned about what might be in the carpet! 
shanghai ever sunshine hotel ,"Great hotel for short/long term stay Stayed at the Eversunshine hotel for 10 days during my business trip in October. We stayed on the 13th floor Duplex apartment and i will stay there again when next time in Shanghai.Rooms were very clean and all furniture and equipment was brand new. Bathroom was a highlight for me, especially the shower. On the main floor we had a fridge and stove and microwave. Neither of those got used during the stay, although i did store some fruits which were purchased in at the fruit stand around the hotel (next to Domino's Pizza ). Our room didn't include internet access so had to pay 40RMB ($6) extra per day for it.I think the hotel has a great location in Pudong area. You have a bank right in the building (another one across the road), several restaurants within couple minutes walking (there is a good one across the road in the building that says TF COFFEE), forgot the name of it, but great food and prices are very fair. Subway is not to far, about 12 minutes walking to Line 4 subway or 15 min walk to Line 2. Only problem i had with hotel is having taxi drivers find it, i always had to give directions (or more like point my way, since i haven't met a single cab driver who spoke English) "
shanghai ever sunshine hotel ,"Better for long term stays than for one or two nights. This is a hotel meant for someone that probably needs a place to stay for more than a few nights. If you're a tourist, then you're better off on the other side of the river where most all of the touristy sights are.The rooms have two floors, with a very steep slippery staircase to the bathroom and bedroom on the second floor. The staff at the desk are NOT very attentive or courteous communicating with the guests.On the other side of the coin, the rooms are clean, new, and nice, and there are coffee shops, restaurants, and large shopping malls (Times Square) within a few minutes on foot. The buffet breakfast was decent enough. Given the alternatives for a quick stay in Pudong the price, room, and amenities were satisfactory. "
shanghai ever sunshine hotel ,"Great Hotel with good outlook Great Hotel with good outlook over Pudong. Duplex Suites with bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Free internet in Business Centre. Lovely breakfasts included with great selection. Nice kitchenette but no utensils to cook/prepare any foods. I had a knife sent up to the room for which I had to sign a docket to either return before departure or be charged for it. Good location - only 5-10 minute walk to main shopping area, 15 minutes to Subway. Close to City (only about 20.00-25.00 RMB to the City in a Taxi). Friendly staff. We had a great view looking over the Pudong area towards the Shopping area and the Towers. "
shanghai ever sunshine hotel ,"Value for money Stayed at the suite room,with 2 big n a small room.Lounge.Very neat n comfortable.Buffet breakfast provided.Surrounding shops at this area had been given a facelift probably becos of the coming EXPO.Really recommend this hotel for value customers. "
shanghai ever sunshine hotel ,"Nice hotel in the Pu Dong Area I stayed at Shanghai Ever Sunshine Hotel for four nights and found it very good. The suites are two floors with the bedrooms at the second floor. Nice friendly staff, The only little problem with this hotel is the location. It's a little bit off and you have to walk for about 15.-20 minutes to the nearest metrostation. But as taxi is very cheap in Shanghai you can get a taxi insted! "
shanghai hotel ,ok but nothing special We stayed here at the end of a tour around China arriving in the early hours after being delayed due to the weather. At check in the staff were rather uncommunicative and after giving us our room didn't even point us in the direction of the lift let alone assist us with where to find our room or help us with our luggage. Rooms were clean and adequately equipped but nothing to write home about and more like a fairly low quality 3* hotel than the 4* it is advertised as. Breakfast was ok with a reasonable range of options but not of a comparable standard to other 4* hotels I have stayed in across Asia.Fine for a night or two as a base in Shanghai but i am sure there are better options around. 
shanghai hotel ,"Ok rooms location not that great Stayed for 2 nights. Rooms were not that big. Small bathroom. Overall ok, but I think that you could find better, closer to sightseeing and shopping.Breakfast was not too good. Not much of an option, so the second day we had breakfast elsewhere.Try the HAPPY FEET massage/reflexology clinic in the alley next to the supermarket. "
shanghai hotel ,"A Vast Improvement... I have stayed at dozens of different hotels in Shanghai and across China, and have stayed at The Shanghai Hotel several times over the past few years.Before the hotel had some irritations for me - minor, but they were there. The staff had previously seemed cold and aloof; the breakfast was mediocre and if I had a problem then the staff's English seemed to disappear.This hotel is one of several in Shanghai managed by Shanghai Jin Jiang International (Group) Company Limited, and has been for some years. Now I am personally convinced that there has been a change of management in this company, and that international management has been brought in.My reasons for saying this are twofold: one, the standard of printed English in the new hotel literature in the rooms is exemplary, the best I have ever seen in China and as far as I am concerned is wordperfect. Second, the transformation in the standard of the hotel is huge. The staff are helpful and pleasant, the duty manager especially went out of his way to help a member of my group who left a cash card in the atm at reception. The breakfast is great, and there are far fewer bored and disinterested staff shuffling about trying to find something to do.I also noticed on this visit to Shanghai that the Peace Hotel, also managed by the same group, has now been closed - not before time! I look forward to it being refurbished and reopening 'under new management'!The Shanghai Hotel has also revamped and improved its business centre, and also had signs pointing to a swiming pool (although I didn't visit this).Also, the improvements here have not resulted in a massive price hike - not yet anyway. "
shanghai hotel ,"overall good hotel. Location was not the greatest, but taxis are cheap. We tried to walk back from the Pu Dong but ended up getting a taxi.Breakfast was nice.Rooms looked a bit tired &amp; bathroom floor stained.Luggage took ages to come up &amp; when i tried to get it off the trolley myself the porters insisted on delivering it themselves. "
shanghai hotel ,"Not Too Bad I stayed at this hotel for three days with a group of high school students at the start of our China Tour. The rooms were OK, though the beds in some rooms were a little hard, it was a lottery as to whether you got a soft bed or a hard bed. I shared a triple room with two other teachers and it was very crowded, but that was to be expected. The breakfasts were quite good - we were served in the Level 1 restaurant which was nicer and less crowded than the ground floor restaurant. Staff were efficient but not overly friendly. Not all staff spoke enough English to communicate our needs but again, we got by. Some of the students ranked this their favourite hotel. "
shanghai hotel ,"A great start to our China Trip This was the start of our 2 week Page &amp; Moy trip. We were very pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel. Staff were very curteous and efficient. Ground floor bar and snack bar was very good (just be aware that if you order a sandwich, it comes with chips and is very filling).The most impressive thing was the breakfast - everything you could want in both western and chinese, even japanese sushi. Would certainly recommend this hotel. "
shanghai hotel ,"Rooms are OK service not so brilliant Stayed here for 3 nights in Sept 07 as part of a tour of Eastern China. The room was comfortable enough with good facilities, but the service left a lot to be desired. Staff at front of house were rather aloof, the bar was a bit of sad lonely place and the mixed drinks not very inspiring. We had a group meal in the hotel one night, and it was awful - as if they were making no effort for a bunch of tourists. "
shanghai hotel ,"Very welcoming and comfotable. I stayed in the Shanghai hotel for work purposes in February/March 2007 and I thought it was really nice. The hotel rooms are well decorated, have air conditioning and heating, tv with various channels including sky news and music channels. The hotel lobby is stunning, large and bright, and has a cosy little bar (which serves very nice red wine). I dined in the executive breakfast room most mornings which had plenty on offer (free, and buffet style including bacon, sausage, cereal, toast, coffee). It also had a beautiful view of the Shanghai skyline. I will return to Shanghai again and each time I do I will use this hotel again, I cannot fault it. "
shanghai hotel ,"A descent hotel at a descent price The location of the hotel is not the best for a tourist on a tight schedule, though the taxi fares in Shanghai is fairly cheap, averaging RMB 17 one way within the city (RMB7.5= U.S.$1). Our friday stay was U.S.$80. Same type of hotel at tourist areas can cost at least $50 or more. The hotel is between end of 3 star to beginning of 4 star with clean beds &amp; bathroom, descently decorated room and lobby, restaurants and gift shops. Their service is pretty well rounded, from laundry service, cell phone charging to currency exchange. Most of the check in/out staffs are friendly except some of the managers standing in the lobby having a very cold look. If you stay less than 2 days in Shanghai, I recommend pay a little more and stay at Nanjing Road which is more centrally located. Otherwise, you can see a lot of local cultures as soon as you walk out of this hotel. There are local small shops, bars &amp; restaurants, convenient stores which are all of good qualities and services. "
shanghai hotel ,"Not the Best in Shanghai My wife and l spent four nights in this Hotel, prior to embarking on a organised tour of China. I approached the Hotel a little apprehensive after viewing many comments on Trip Advisor.It was certainly not a four star Hotel as purported in the Travel Brochures, and would rate at the bottom end of three star.Be that as it may, our accomodation was clean. The location of the hotel is near the subway, but more importantly it is in a location that allows you to wander the streets and see many of the real faces of China. There are plenty of small shops nearby and a large supermarket within one km..Whilst l found the reception staff quite unpleasant, all other staff were approachable and where possible helpful. For a Hotel that has significant foreign tourism, there is indeed a lack of English language support available within the Hotel.Breakfast was indeed satisfactory, although there are two locations and there seemed continual confusion into which dining room we should attend. My tip is just be polite and direct and they will agree with you.The Laundry service here was indeed cheap and excellent. "
shanghai hotel ,"Very good location We stayed six nights at the Shagnhai Hotel on Wulumugi Bei Lu as part of our 14 days group tour of China in May from Alberta, Canada. We had a room on the 14th floor. This hotel is located in a busy district of Shanghai across from the biggest hospital in Shanghai. From our room we could hear the traffic and car honks early in the morning. The hotel rooms were small, and yet the hotel had met our travel expectations: clean room, clean bathroom, hot shower, and working air conditioning. The quality of the Western and Chinese buffet breakfast was average. The hotel is within walking distance to many local shops, an upscale mall, a subway station, and restaurants including Pizza Hut. Taxi fare is cheap in China. We took the taxi to visit the new Pudong commercial district overlooking the Bund and the Shanghai Museum. The most we paid on taxi fare was 26 RMB, which was less than $4.00 Canadian. If you like Chinese arts, culture, and history, the Shanghai Museum is a must see. The entrance fee is 20 RMB, which is less than $3.00 Canadian, a great bargain. The museum also has a great gift shop. If you are looking good local restaurants in Shanghai, visit Canglefang on #333 Changle Road for Shanghai food, Dongbeiren on Shan Shee South Road for Northern Chinese food and the waitresses will sing Chinese folk songs at your table, and Paulaner Brauhaus Shanghai at Riverside Promenade overlooking the Bund, Binjiang Dadao in Pudong for very good German cuisines, burgers, fries, and clubhouse sandwiches. "
shanghai hotel ,Very short stay The hotel was booked as part of a package deal. We were in a twin room for 2 nights. We didn't use all the hotel's facilities as we were out visiting sites most of the time. Buffet breakfasts were a great start to the days sight seeing. 
shanghai hotel ,"OK but nothing special We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. It is ok, but nothing special. We only paid 85$ a night, so it is a fair price for that hotel. You will enjoy Shanghai, a very nice town.Two negative things: First, we had to wait very long to get checked in, second, the internet was definately not high speed.Would come again "
shanghai hotel ,"Very good hotel near Jing'An Subway stop We stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 6 months, and each time had a great stay. It appears to cater to Asian and European tourists and business people, so you will see almost no North Americans. The hotel rooms - at least in our experience - meet US standards. The rooms are well decorated with all the amenities, the furniture is well-styled and well-maintained (except in one room where it was pretty scratched), Cable TV works well, the mini bar is well-stocked, etc. The lobby is a bit spartan, altho there are some gift shops. You won't get any phone calls asking if you want a &quot;massage&quot; as you would at some other Chinese hotels, but you will usually see some &quot;ladies&quot; standing discreetly in the shopping arcade entrance at night. The hotel has a business services office with Internet - use it if you must, but there is an internet gaming center about a block from the Jing An subway stop that offers 1 hour of internet access for the equivalent of US$1. This hotel is conveniently located from an Italian restaurant and coffee shop called Vero Moda, a traditional tea shop called Sophie's, and a very good restaurant called A Future Perfect. If you're making reservations while you're in China, use elong.net ( a partner of Expedia) to get the best rates. "
shanghai hotel ,"OK but not great The rooms themselves are pretty nice and the bed is very comfortable. I disagree with the previous reviewer though who said the location is good - it's about a 10mins walk and 5 stops on the subway to the Bund or over 30mins in a taxi due to the everpresent rush-hour. There are many more hotels much closer to the centre. The level of English at reception was very poor which you would not expect in a 4-star in Shanghai. The gym is a real disgrace - one treadmill, one bike and a few dumbells in the middle of a hallway outside the business centre - if queuing for everything with no A/C and a load of bored businessmen watching you is your idea of fun then this is the gym for you! Finally breakfast is pitched very much at the Asian traveller with soggy, warm toast adn undercooked eggs the choice for the westerner. "
shanghai hotel ,The Shanghai Hotel was my home for three weeks... I stayed in the Shanghai Hotel for 19 days while visiting friends there. I enjoyed my stay there including the free American Breakfast. The location is excellent for commuting to many parts of the central city..Staff was cordial and well dressed and helpful to me. The room was clean and well maintained by our porter. I highly recommend the hotel.Ron Lewis 
shanghai hotel ,"OK Accommodation but good location Hotel is really old but location is good. Neighborhood has all that you need. The only &quot;ding&quot; in our room is that the shower [--] - water is REALLY weak. Other than that, clean and comfy hotel. We paid about US$80 per night and was told that it's a good deal for the quality and location. "
shanghai hotel ,"Loved Shanghai We stayed at the Shanghai hotel for 3 nights at the start of our tour with Page &amp; Moy. The hotel staff were numerous and friendly and the only problem, if you could call it that, was when we came to change travellers cheques. The hotel has a policy of ringing the bank to clear acceptance of travellers cheques and on 2 occasions it took about 20 minutes to do this even though they were Thomas Cook cheques and we had our passports with us. Obviously they have been stung by fakes in the past but we wished we had just taken cash with us instead of cheques as recommended by the tour company. This was the only hotel where this happened - elsewhere no problem. The rooms were large and clean. The furnishings had seen better days but were acceptable. The location is not that far from city centre but taxi needed to get there as crossing roads is an impossibility with thousands of bikes, mopeds and 4 lanes of cars in each direction. There was a lovely Italian restaurant about 200 yards away which made a nice contrast to Chinese food twice a day! The restaurant tended to be crowded at breakfast time as many people with tour companies leaving early on days out. There was a good selection of western items at breakfast including egg, bacon, toast, fruit, fruit juice, cereals and yoghurt. Do not miss Shanghai at night and the 'tunnel' ride under the river - Fantastic!! A real highlight. "

shanghai jc mandarin ,"Ok but there are better hotels in Asia Not as plush as other Asian hotels. Restaurant is just a little bit less than others, and so are the rooms. Bit old, bit noisy, bit small (compared to for example Renaissance).Also the lobby entrance felt more like a freezer due to a horrible draft from the outside stormy wheather.It also doesn't help that during our stay Obama was in town next door at the Ritz Carlton and that traffic around the hotel (and city) was completely blocked... "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"very good central hotel Hotel quality is very good, rooms are large good equipped. Only thing I could complain is internet cost (around 18 $ per day) "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"comfort location and value Spacious rooms, good service, good value -- this is a good choice in central Shanghai. Restaurants in hotel are only fair, not very good. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Not bad at all! I am currently staying in this hotel, so thought a 'live' review would be handyFirst of all, its a large business type hotel, big lobby area with restaurant and bar. The room is a nice size , some would say its dated, but actually it seems okay to me. Personally I would say its a bit 1990's but not as bad as some other reviewers give the impression of. There is a mini-bar, tea and coffee making facilities, a nice sized desk for me to work on, but will say internet connection is not the fastest speed and apparently you cant access the 'facebook' website in China, although I hear there are ways round it! The bathroom is fully tiled, quite modern with a bath tub and shower unit, all very clean an pleasent. The bed is nice with soft pillows and a good sized wadrobeI had breakfast in the restaurant this morning. Its the typical business hotel breakfast with many choices. I must admit, the bacon, baked beans and hash browns were surprisingly nice considering I am in China so thought (maybe unfairly) it wouldnt taste so good. The downside is the price...about £20 as I write, so if you are like me, and just want a small bite and a coffee rather than a full slap-up, then you'll find it very pricey, so if you have breakfast here, make sure you get your moneys worthI had dinner tonight in the steak restaurant, very posh looking and lovely food, although the portions were smaller than I was expecting, again a bit pricey but being dinner and in plush surroundings its not too bad I guess.The fitness room is a good size and has a fair range of machines and weights and the massage spa is lovely. I had a wonderful 1hr massage but again, the price was quite a lot -£80.....Some reviewers complain about the service at this hotel, although I have found it fine. Okay, there isnt the 'in your face genuine smiles' that you get in the Dubai hotels, but its not the cheesy American &quot;have a nice day only because I want a tip&quot; type service eitherArea: well, all of Shanghai in my view is scruffy and this no worse than the 70kms I covered around the city today...this hotel is handy for shops and there are a few local restaurants nearby, but none that took my fancy...a bit too down to earth for my taste!Overall a decent business hotel, not a bad location, internet speed a bit slow, restaurant pricey, but yes...I would return here "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Nice enough location not perfect. Had a suite which was nice. The steak restaurant was good! Location good for shopping, nothing else.Service was ok for foreigners, but abusive towards chinese.All in all, I'd rather have stayed nearer the river. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Great location clean room Great location &amp; amazing service , It is reasonably priced and has wonderful pool and room facilities. I highly recommend it and will consider it again on my next visit. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,Lovely Five Star Hotel This is a five stars hotel located in the central shanghai business area. (tripadvisor indicates it is 3-star - which is wrong.) It is good for business traveller because of its location. Good value for money for hotels in this area. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"never take hotel services Good hotel for the price but never take the hotel services because you will not have enough for your money, it cost me 95 US dollars for couple of pieces of laundry and internet very expensive too. However, staff very nice and pollite. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Chinese New Year delights! Out of the 4 Hotels I stayed in during my 10 day visit to Shanghai, this was the 1st. I decided to go a couple of days prior to my business meetings as I got a great discount on the rate in celebration of the Chinese new Year. I splurged in a limo pick up &amp; somewhere along on the way to my room, I misplaced a little money. I am so impressed with the Mandarin's Security for following it through so thoroughly.The Hotel is easily accessible to Shopping and sight seeing and walking distance to theatres, etc. The Room service menu is great - chicken rice a must try. The view is even better, esp at night when the city is lit till 10pm or so. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Needs a refit I have to say I’m disappointed with this hotel given the price of it. Outside and the lobby are nice but the corridors and dark and dirty looking; the rooms are a good size but shabby out of date furniture and décor. I’m here on business for a week and the lack of a proper desk and desk chair make working on the laptop quite uncomfortable after a while. I don’t think it represents value for money; the only good thing is the location. I haven't tried the food. Next time, I’ll stay at The Equatorial which is only about 10mins walk away and much better value for money. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"OK but willing to try something else next time in Shanghai! Spent 3 nights at this hotel. Lobby is very nice and fresh. The staff is friendly. Rooms are ok but needs for sure renovation in the bathroom. The water doesn't smell nice when you take a shower. Lot of stains on the carpet in the room and in the corridors. I haven't tried the breakfast because it was too expensive (RMB235 or so! like 25EURO)...probably very good though! Instead you can get a coffee and scone for 40 RMB at Starbucks located 2 minutes from the hotel. The hotel is located in luxury street where all famous brands have their shop. They have a quite big SPA and swimming pool. I have tried massage - really expensive (cheapest is around 80EURO) but it was really professional. Worth the try if you can.It takes about 1h by car (when no traffic jam) to the Pudong Airport and costs about RMB150.For diner, dare go out (it is very safe-mind your wallet though!) and you will find good local restaurants at very reasonable prices. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Not a 5 star as they claimed Currently staying at JC Mandarin Hotel, am very dissapointed with the room! It is old and outdated, the carpet has stained so badly, it is dusty and still using the bath tub concept for a shower. As we have stayed before in the Meritus Mandarin chain of hotels, we expected to have a good weekend relaxing in the room as we have been travelling a lot and the meritus hotels we stayed in Singapore was really good and the bed was very comfortable so that's why we choose this place for our stay in Shanghai. So we do feel cheated for paying a the price of a so called 5 star hotel when i would really rate it as a 3 star hotel!We encounter a problem during the check-in, our long journey flight arrived 7am, so we wanted to check-in and they refused us as we were too early. The manager spoke to us and told us that for the price we are paying at a 5 star hotel it is the best rate ever compared to so many 5 star hotels and they certainly cannot accomodate us to check-in early and if we want to, they would have to charge us a half day rate. With many 5 star hotels we stayed in, when the flight is an early arrival, they do accomodate as the guest would normally be very tired and need to freshen up. The manager said to us that they could only extend a courtesy to check us in at 11am so we were left waiting. We were so tired and we really did look forward to resting and by the time we got our room... big dissapointment! My husband is allergic to dust and he has been sneezing ever since we gotten our room! We will never stay here again and we would rather pay for a better package at another hotel. Even though they did have a good rate, we still feel cheated as they did not live up to the name and the 5 star rating!Jancy TanA frequent traveller! "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Reasonable for price Good location, great breakfasts. Rooms spacious but would be four star only just. Service good, but food and beverage very expensive compared to other great restaurants in the area. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Time to refurb Currently staying in the JC Mandarin. On entry to the lobby it doesn't look too bad, however the rooms are old and dated. The carpet looks dirty and does't feel too nice on your feet.The mini bar is very expensive as is the cost to browse the internet, which is very very slow. On the plus side the food is pretty good, if not a tad expensive. Although you have to be very clear on your order as mine was messed up twice ! "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Suitable Hotel I would absolutely stay here again if the price is right. Our room was clean and had a nice view. There was road work in front of the hotel which made the streets very dusty. Otherwise, neighborhood is nice. The Ritz Carlton is just across the street. My partner and I had dinner there and it was horrible. The restaurant at JC Mandarin was much better. But, when you're in Shanghai go out to eat! The concierge gave us great recommendations. She also helped book excursions for us to Shouzu and an ancient water town. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"acceptable accomodation but not five star The JC Mandarin is a perfectly adequate and clean hotel. However, it just isn't up to five star standards. The rooms are clean but the carpet is worn and the furniture out dated. I went to use the Jacuzzi and it was warm not hot. The sauna and steam room in the women's locker room were turned off and there was no one there to explain how to turn them on. On the plus side, the service was generally prompt and efficient. The food was reasonably good although not exceptional. It is in a really central location and very close to the French Concession, one of the nicest areas of Shanghai. The staff was courteous and efficient. The gym is in pretty good shape. I guess there is a reason that this five star hotel is significantly cheaper than the others in its class in Shanghai. It really is more of a four star. But, if you are looking for a clean, well staffed, and convenient place to stay the JC Mandarin is fine. Just don't expect anything special. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,Yuck ! Old - poor service - dirty carpets Poor Service - dirty carpets - expensive - I stayed at this 17 year old hotel for 5 nights in April 2008. It has seen better days. The staff does not speak English very well. There is a lack of service -not a good price/value ratio. I stayed on the &quot;Club&quot; floor and moved to one of the remolded rooms on the 6th floor when the phones in my room did not work. The sixth floor is NOISY.The &quot;Club&quot; floor rooms are OLD and dirty - the carpets are dirty and the rooms smell off. There are many problems with things not working in the rooms. The phones are very old and the hotel charges for every call - even to a calling card access phone number. The food in the club on the 2nd floor is limited in options. Overall - NOT a 5 star hotel at 5 star prices. It is more a 3 star hotel - OLD - DIRTY - BAD SERVICE. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"No complaint First impression from the lobby once got in gave us some mixed felling. It was all very clean and nice, and while lobby design was somewhat 90's, the rooms were probably designed a decade earlier. Dated and nothing special, but very clean in the room and bathroom. Staff were good, but mixed feeling from the check-in/out. Internet and minibar charged standard ripped off price. Take it or leave it, no LCD TV but the old one worked fine. Great varieties breakfast and in good supply, great service from friendly staff, buffet dimsum also very tasty and highly recommend.At this price, absolutely no complaint, and considering it's convenient location on Nanjing road, I have no problem to stay here again. Great for business / pleasure in SHA. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Worked well I just stayed here for a week and had no complaints really. They did mess up a late night room service order, but not a big deal. The hotel was clean and the rooms were plenty large enough with a good view of Nanjing Road. They had plenty of staff on hand and the breakfast which was included in the rate was pretty good. We used the health club a couple of times and they had plenty of equipment, especially since we were the only ones in there both times. I would have no problem recommending this hotel again. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,lively hotel Nice and lively hotel! Clean and spacious rooms with up to standard bathroom. Outstanding breaskfast buffet. Quite goood location: easy access to taxis and 5 minutes walk from metro stations. Good availability of english speaking staff. Booked through hotels.com and gained a good internet tariff which made it a very good value for money. Would definitely stay here again. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,Mandarin Nothing special. Functional. Big rooms but a bit dated style-wise. Solid breakfast. Business services over-priced. (internet at China Telcom at airport a tenth of cost). 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Nice Hotel - Mega Breakfast Shanghai was our first stop in our china tour and we stayed in this hotel for two nights. The hotel, the rooms and toilets were clean and tidy. Pre-booked our room and our tour guide dealth with the reception staff so there was no hassel, we just sat down and waited for the keys while everything was being sorted out. The room was lovely ans spacious, nice bed. Clean bathroom with a nice shower!Breakfast was the best we had in china, the presentation was grand, so many choices of foods you kinda walk around not knowing what to have. healthy options, fried options, western options, eastern options, great!! maybe the Tea was a bit dodgy, i like my tea served the british way, i dont know what was wrong with the tea there, the land of the tea, maybe it was the water or the milk? lots of fruit juices so you can always go healthy!and oh yes the chefs, about 4-5 behind the counter will also make you omelettes, and they are always cooking to make sure none of the food plates are empty.decided to head down to the piano bar for a drink, turns out there are other possibilities once you get down there, the drinks are quite expensive as that is not the main needs of a customers who would go down there, its a good option to have ;-)The location of the hotel possibly isnt the best if you are in town for a few days as a tourist, its in the middle of two metro stations so you have a bit of a walk in either direction, metro is easy to understand. lots of shopping centres by the hotel, the one right next to it is all designer stuff, if you are into that sort of thing.final conclusion : i would recommend this hotel to anyone, only possible let down is the location. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Bungled Reservation but the breakfast buffet's not bad Flew into Shanghai in late Aug. At check-in, they gave us two twin beds in a smoking room instead of the non-smoking double bed I booked (I booked the 2 nights well in advance). Once in the room, there was a noticeable odor from the bathroom, the carpet was worn, and the bathroom tiles had plenty of cracks. Even though we were on the 4th floor (again, I had requested something a little higher, but I understand that's not always possible), the view of the street was nice. The internet charge, though not exorbitant (i seem to recall 50rmb) seemed a little steep, especially considering that there are web cafes around and we're already paying plenty. You can't fit much in the room safe (I tried my hp tablet laptop, to no avail).The location is fine, not too far from the Nanjing West subway stop. It's caddy corner to the Ritz-Carlton. There are loads of shops around, and though we trekked it all the way to the Bund from here, I wouldn't recommend it. The staff was snappy, not warm. I'd say the best part of the whole stay was the breakfast buffet, which although fantastic, hardly made up for the rest of it. For the money, I'll stay somewhere else next time I'm in Shanghai. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,great location but a bit tired i stayed at this hotel for business purposes and the location is fantastic. The rooms are a bit tired and lack any sort of special 5 star touches. They charged me for receiving an international call so watch this! I have to highly praise Frank the concierge who was extremely helpful to me when my baggage was lost by the airline. I found the spa to be very nice but also extremely expensive. All in all its okay but nothing special. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Good Hotel for Business Meeting I stayed at JCM for a business meeting. After reading the postings, I was not sure what to expect, I have to say that I did have a good stay at the JCM. The room was a bit dated but clean. The shower was hot and strong. Bathroom amenities were on par with high grade hotels. Beyond the normal soap, shampoo and lotion, they also provided toothbrush, paste, sewing kit, nail file, cotton balls and 2 bottles of water daily to brush your teeth. They also had slippers which I have only gotten at hotels like The Regent.Airline lost my luggage and the laundry service was very good, housekeeping came by nightly to pick up my clothes for laundry and returned them early next day.Internet service was good. I did not have a problem, I even used it to call home via Skype so connection was consistant.My room came with a breakfast buffet, which was very nice. The service was as fast as I could help myself. Buffet was very bountiful and had both Western and Asian selections. Coffee is very strong and was cold one morning, but I mentioned this and it was fixed right away.Our meeting was in the Ballrooms on the 3nd floor and 6th floor. The meeting rooms were very nice and seem to be updated. My only complaint is that one of our speakers requested a wireless microphone, which is standard AV equipment, this never happened.As a single female traveler, I was concerned about the posting regarding the red light district and prostitutes. I never saw working girls nor did I every feel unsafe at the hotel. I even wandered across the street one evening and walked around the mall before they closed. Hotel staff watches everyone that enters the building. Although their hallways can be better lit. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,It's gone DOWNHILL This is my fifth stay at this hotel. Unfortunately the rooms seem to have gotten worse over the years. I can tolerate some wear and tear but the room smelled like cat urine and that made things worse. You really didn't want to walk on the carpet without shoes. It is quite disgusting.You must be very careful when booking this hotel and bring all your documentation with you. I overheard a conversation at the front desk about a price change in the middle of someone's stay. I've encountered this before with them and believe me they won't budge even if you have a confirmed reservation. It appears the only confirmation they will be sure to honor is one made directly through the hotel's website. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Great loca. don't expect good internet service The location of this hotel is great-- right in the shopping district of Shanghai.However, as a biz. traveler, my main requirement is reliable high-speed internet service, and, having traveled all over Asia and the world, this hotel's internet service is one of the worst. It is hard wired, but automatically logs you out every 30 minutes! The staff is incredibly attentive and tries to be helpful, but they have poor knowledge about their system. The people were great, and the food excellent. If i didn't need the internet, I'd stay here again. But, for business, think twice. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"A very good value at $120/night It's not the St. Regis so don't expect overdone rooms with over-the-top baroque styling and ridiculous bathrooms. Also, this hotel doesn't feel terribly new ... not worn out, but not new. Overall, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The price is good, the location convenient (3.5 blocks from the metro), the staff most helpful, and the rooms nice.The bed and linens are great, and the room's amenities are all good. Sure, there's no 37&quot; LCD TV, but the fabulous breakfast buffet and good exercise facilities are included for free. Also, the Hotel's bars are genuinely nice places to take a nightcap or chat with friends.Save about 50% over the St. Regis and spend it going out for a nice dinner and drinks afterwards. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Value for money There appears to be a number of differing opinions as to this hotel. I was initially put off by the reviews that gave very poor ratings and suspicious of the overly glowing reports. I hope my account will be somewhat more objective. Most are in agreement that this hotel is in a good location along Nanjing West Road, known for the supposedly fancier shops and malls. A taxi fare for 11 RMB will get you to most of the other tourist attractions. In the evening outside the hotel on the roadside, you will find a few locals peddling their wares, and pimps and prostitutes will approach hotel guests that leave the premises on foot. A firm &quot;no&quot; (or &quot;yes&quot; as the case may be) will usually be all that is required. The much talked about lobby with the mural was nice, but most people just walked past it on the way to the lifts after seeing it once. There are no seats in the lobby for guests or their friends to sit and relax. Instead they have seating that is part of the cafe and restaurant which would feel awkward if not buying anything there. The room itself was clean and comfortable. There were all the usual amenities, however the room lacked an iron and board. The decor I agree was not modern, but it was not outdated. The broadband internet connection was variable and could be slow at times. The internet charge was 120 RMB per day which I thought was unnecessarily high. The water pressure for the shower/bath combo was strong. However the water did take an unsually long time to drain from the wash-basin. The air-conditioning functioned well. The carpet was not worn out as some reviews had mentioned. Room service was usually prompt, however some items on the menu were occasionally not available (usually in the early hours of the morning). Housekeeping were quick, but had the annoying habit in hotels of calling the room in the afternoon to ask if they could clean it even if you have the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign hanging.Most of the staff spoke English, and though not fluent, was certainly adequate. The concierge service was helpful, but limited so be prepared to do your own research. The front door staff were useful interpreters for the taxis. However it is much faster to walk the short distance to the roadside and hail a cab. The breakfast on the ground floor level 1 was good, with a decent variety. The service in the other restaurants was slow at times. Overall I think the experience was entirely satisfactory. There was nothing outstanding or extraordinary about this hotel, but it certainly provided a good standard. It certainly wasn't perfect, but for me personally, I didn't find the minor defects much of an issue. The cost of the room was much less expensive than the other 5 star hotels. The location was good, and all in all I think this was a value for money stay. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Perfectly Lovely We where staying on the Club Floor and had an amazing room, it was clean and comfortable. The pool was great for my neices, I was just disappointed that we where not going to be there on the days they gave yoga or belly dancing lessons in the fitness club. The staff was extreamly helpful and our every need was their top priority. The club lounge was great and they accomidated our desire for a private room so the children could have free run and not both other patrons. We will definately stay here on our next trip to Shanghai. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Excellent Service Comfortable and Convenient My business counterparts and I took an extended stay at this hotel and were very impressed.Service is impeccable. The front staff was plentiful and always willing to help. The manager even sought me out in the lobby to ask for my business card so that he could give me a corporate rate during my next stay. The concierge helped me with sending FedEx packages and even arrange to get a box for me.The restaurant on the main floor offers a wide variety of Asian and Western food, especially in its buffet. I personally enjoyed the fluffy pancakes and made to order omelets in the morning. The table staff was extremely prompt to take away dirty plates and bring you fresh drinks.The business center and &quot;Mandarin Club&quot; staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. They worked hard to learn our names so that they could address us by name. The Mandarin Club itself is a quiet place where you can conduct business meetings or just enjoy a quiet drink or breakfast. It is located away from the main action on the 2nd floor.The gym on the 4th floor is large and has everything under the sun you would want to use to work out. State-of-the-art treadmills for my morning run.If you stay here I recommend getting a room on the &quot;Mandarin Club&quot; floors. It is about $40 more expensive but you get free drinks, breakfast, and afternoon snacks You also get larger bottles of water in the room and a 50% discount on your laundry. Also get one free item pressed per day.We'll be back! "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Overpriced but Central Hotel general areas are nice but the standard rooms are quite worn out and old. The size of the room is spacious and clean but need to be refurbished. Internet surcharge is expensive and so does everything else inside the hotel!Btw, hotel booking online via Chinese travel agencies (websites), you'll get better deals.The taxi price is very cheap in Shanghai so I would recommand people to stay a bit outside the center (i.e. the bund &amp; main shopping street, Nanjing east road). "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"So many staff on duty at wrong times Ho hum.....is the best way to describe this place. There are a heap of staff behind the desk at useless times of the day and 2 on duty during the 10am - 11am check-out rush. Rooms are TIRED and have a certain dusty feeling about them. They've basically done the lobby up to look incredible then done nothing with the rooms. There are so many better places to stay like the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons or Sofitel....all onthe main street there. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,Beautiful Hotel This hotel was excellent. I spent 3 nights here while on a business trip and I have no complaints. The service was excellent and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The lobby was incredible. There's a nice coffee shop and a restaurant and both were great. Check-in took about 3 minutes and all of the employees were friendly and very helpful. 
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Great experience at the JC Mandarin I stayed here with a group of 21 Americans while on a tour of China. To a person, we were delighted with this hotel.There are some mixed reviews on this site, but I think they date back to when the hotel was in the middle of a renovation, which by 10/06 had long been completed.The rooms are very nice; almost as nice as the Ritz Carleton across the street where I stayed two years ago. Very luxurious and well-appointed. Mine was starting to show a few signs of wear in the carpet and grouting on the tub, but nothing to get upset about.The location is great for Westerners and sightseers: on one of the big shopping streets, Nanjing Lu, with many familiar retail brands all aorund; many restaurants, and night life within close proximity. Central to the French Concession, People's Square with the great Shanghai Museuma and other attractions, and on the subway line to Pudong and Jin Mao Tower in the futuristic new part of Shanghai across the river. (Subway is fully titled in English and easy to navigate.)I especially liked the 3rd Floor Wine Bar and Grille which has a great bar and the staff seems to understand American cocktails, which is a rarity in China. We had a private group dinner here that was beautifully done with wonderful Western food -- a welcome treat after having Chinese food for lunch and dinner for two weeks. The staff did an incredible job with every element of it; so I'm sure it's great if you're just dining their - intimate, modern and luxurious.The door staff was particularly good (and English fluent) in terms of flagging cabs and helping you get where you're going.The breakfast buffet downstairs at Tattler's is excellent. A caution on the little ice cream cafe in the front of the lobby: except for the ice cream, their food comes from Tattler's and takes 20-30 minutes to get there, so you're better off just going to Tattler's if you want food in the lobby. And the lobby &quot;bar&quot; seems to run out of steam early in the nite. At about 10 o'clock we were only able to get wine; no cocktails.Laundry and housekeeping were prompt. The business center was capable and efficient.Overall, a great place to stay in Shanghai (and I've stayed at 5 different hotels there.) "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Not a bad place to stay From noida , india .Stayed with my husband in sept. 2006 for 4 nights. the location of the hotel is excellent with the high profile shopping area in the close vicinity. We had booked for executive rooms and paid a high room tariff but the room was quite ordinary . Infact wondering what their standard room would be like. We always had to wait for a long time to get a taxi from the hotel lobby. Most of the staff spoke little english which is a major handicap. Served good breakfast. All in all , a satisfactory experience. However would like to try a better hotel next time. "
shanghai jc mandarin ,"Hit and Miss -- Now you've got it now you've not This is a good hotel insofar that its location is perfect for getting to Nanjing Road addresses, high-end shopping and some nice eating places in posh Shanghai. The metro station is also within walking distance and you can get to many places in Shanghai city proper via the metro.The design of the hotel is a bit dated, admittedly, but I do like some of the chinoiserie feel of the hotel, especially the lacquer panels at the lobby depicting famed Admiral Cheng Ho and his travels, and the spacious lobby and kitschy layout of the common areas in general. It has obviously undergone a renovation, but it seems to me the renovation was not all-out, with some 1980s look still apparent.The rooms look less renovated and more trapped in the 1980s mode. Which is a surprise to me, as I was told this hotel started only in 1990. The amenities of a five-star hotel are all there, but the furniture in the room I stayed in was obviously dated. There were no tears to the sofa or broken legs to the tables, of course, but the age of the furniture definitely shows. The lack of a separate shower was also a disappointment, as I'd expected one in such a supposedly posh hotel. The bed was hard and firm, which is to my liking. They provided me with a foam pillow, as per my request, and I have no problem falling into slumberland during my week-long stay there.I did not taste the food there at all during my stay, as I was out and about most days, returning only late at night. I did go see the gym and pool, and felt that it was adequate but not impressive.Service wise, this hotel is as good as any Chinese-run five-star hotel in Shanghai. Unless it's Four Seasons or the St Regis, I must say that service standard in Shanghai or for that matter in China is generally not great. So, this hotel is not dissimilar in that aspect, and I can say it's like at the Hilton in Shanghai, the Marriot Hongqiao or the Renaissance Yangtze. Nothing to rave about, they do most of the tasks and carry out most of the requests but nothing more. Speaking Mandarin or Shanghainese does help, as most of the staff hardly understand English.For the amount I paid (RMB 970), I think this hotel serves its purpose. I like its location for being so near my Shanghai office, and this matters in Shanghai because transport here is a major problem due to the perenial jams. Convenience was also there, as I have the option of getting cheap food, going to a convenience stall and doing my grocery shopping at a supermart at the Shanghai Center which is obviously catered to Westerners. There is a Starbucks near it, and lots of shopping which is found in any standard Western city.So verdict: I think I will stay here again. Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't seem to know it at all. But unless you're looking to be treated like a king, for a spa for magnificent massage, and a huge room with extras such a massage chair, big flat-screen LCD TV and designer-brand bathroom amenities, you'd be satisfied with JC Mandarin.Oh, and one point to note: for some strange reasons, this hotel attracts lots of Singapore and Malaysia-based Chinese. The brand of Mandarin they speak is vastly different from that spoken in Shanghai and most big Chinese cities. I was pleasantly tickled by this twang of theirs, and had a good time observing these folks spouting their, I'd say, patois, even as they look similar to any Chinese out there. Reminds me of my stays in Singapore, just that I didn't notice how different their Chinese is.Later, I found out that the group running this hotel is Singapore-based. Ah... is that the reason for the Admiral Cheng Ho murals for his travels to Southeast Asia, and the attraction to the Singapore and Malaysia guests? "

shanxi business hotel ,"A great Introduction to China! My family of 4 stayed at this hotel at the beginning of our 2 week holiday as part of a small group tour. Hubby &amp; I stayed in a double room that was quite small, our teenage children shared a twin room that was much larger. At the time, we all found the beds to be very hard, but further into our holiday we realised that this was nothing compared to beds in other hotels!Breakfast was a mixture of western hot food/toasts (but not much in the way of cereals) &amp; interesting local foods. The mushrooms particularly were delicious. TIP for westerners who like their cup of tea/coffee bring your own bags &amp; little sachets of UHT (long life) milk to make a cuppa in your room. Milk is usually powdered in China &amp; generally hard to come by. The tea served at breakfast was very weak &amp; the coffee almost undrinkable!There is an ATM in the hotel lobby.The surrounding neighbourhood was safe to explore at night, just a few blocks from impressive department stores with lots of interesting local stores/streets/alley ways on the way. "
shanxi business hotel ,"Great value good hotel Having previously stayed in Shanghai at the Oriental a few times , a chinese friend suggsted I try this hotel.I was assured it would be OK. It was more than OK, I thought it was great value for the price paid and was upto a good four star standard. I did book the larger room and it was worth the extra $40US per night. I saw some of the smaller rooms and they did look small. I found the room and its furnishings to be of a good standard and the room to be very clean.Check in was easy and most staff spoke good english. The breakfast was quite satisfactory and I found the food and level of service to be of a good standard. Staff were available to answer my questions and provide helpful advise about local restaurants and how to get around, always enquiring if they could do anything else to help.It was located near the financial centre and in easy walking distance to Nathan Rd and the embassies. As always, cabs being so cheap, making getting around out of peak traffic times easy. A cab from the hotel to the Maglev train airport connection cost 40RMB. The only drawback I saw was a 10 minute walk to the underground, but then walking around Shanghai is always interesting.If you are after a good hotel with quite acceptable facilities and location, this is the pace. Hotel rates for some hotels in Shanghai can be high but I found this hotel be of a good standard and a very good price. I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Shanghai. If you are on business and want a clean and comfortable place to stay, this is it. "
shanxi business hotel ,"Good hotel I went to that hotel a bit afraid after reading the only review available at the Net, but the result was a a nice surprise,I travel a lot, mainly on business and although the Shaanxi cannont compare with international chains it was quite good, so was the price. I would rate this hotel in the medium range of the 4 stars type.Many different rooms to chose, if you want to upgrade from the basic for a moderate additional, slighty noisy at night with the motorway by. Beds are a bit hard, but after a day walking in the city, you don´t mind. The service was superb, always helpful with directions and checking that you wouldnt forget anything in the taxi. Some delays checking out. Food average, could be improved with some occidental food, but you are in China after all.Located 10 minutes front the center of the city, the fare would cost just above the minimun 11 RMB (1 euro), and 155 from Pudong airport.I would repeat this hotel next time I head for Shanghai. "
shanxi business hotel ,"Who needs anything else I've worked all over the Far East and stayed in some very nice hotels. So it was important to me that the only review I could fine on this hotel was accurate, which I have to say it's not! I found the Shaanxi to be a fine hotel, OK it’s not draped in the opulence some people might be used to nor is it practically good looking compared to others. But the service is excellent, advice on where to go, what to see and how to get places is second to none.Rooms are exposed to noisy traffic, but show me somewhere in Shanghai that isn’t!If I had one criticism it would be the 3rd floor restaurant, the food at my table was not that good, and a little overpriced. But again I ask the question, what the hell are you doing sitting in a hotel restaurant when there are so many other fabulous places to see and eat in Shanghai.Although the TV’s in the rooms are mainly for the Chinese (only one American channel – CNN) its spacious, clean, new and everything works, including the mini-bar fridge!!The beds are quite hard, which suited me but may not for others who prefer something a little softer! Nice décor and matching colour schemes are also important to me, and I was not disappointed.All in all a very nice hotel, with staff who are prepared to do anything for you, even make you a hot sandwich at 04:00 in the morning, simply would not happen in the UK. You will not be disappointed with your stay here, nor the bill at the end of your stay. Happy Travels! "
shanxi business hotel ,"Basic basic basic Traveling with two Chinese colleagues, one from Hong Kong and one from Taiwan, we stayed here for three nights. Room sizes varied widely. One was tiny, one medium and one was huge. The hotel seemed new and things were still pretty fresh. Even though a newer hotel, the carpet was showing the wear of past occupants.If you stay here you might want a room on the back side of the hotel. All the rooms on the front are almost literally on the freeway.The windows do what they can to shut out the noise, but its a major freeway. Even my colleagues were not enchanted with the breakfast buffet and were ready to hit the streets looking for some place else for breakfast or dim sum after the first day. The buffet was expensive for what was offered.This is the place if you need a clean room and the basics. It offers little in the way of charm or personality.The staff was helpful and there were English speakers on the staff in most areas. Taxis are readily available. I'd look for more interesting options for the same price that are a better value next time I am in Shanghai. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"a genuine 5 star hotel My husband and I took advantage of their weekend rate, we stayed last Friday- Sunday and it was a good conclusion to our trip in Shanghai after we had an unpleasant stay at another hotel. We have been to many high class hotels and this is one of them, beautiful decor and quality furnitures throughout. Food was good and staff generally helpful and spoke good English which is an exception in China. Overall we were very happy with the Sheraton. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Need to do more to keep up to the Brand Name Sheraton is a brand who's tag line is 'belong'. Being a SPG platinum member, I have stayed in quite a few Sheraton's. All my colleague's advice me to stay at the renaissance next door which I heed to till date. But in a fit of fury i decided to stay at the Sheraton. Lobby: Good expansive lobby. Bit old. but functional. Service in the lobby was quick and I was escorted to my room( which was changed a day later due to maintenance work.)Rooms: Had what you may call a suite - a big room separated by a partition. First thing when one goes into a hotel room would notice is the smell. If the room smells good it would probably be pleasant. But it was Bad here. Did not expect this from Sheraton. I suppose it is do with the AC and the rains. The service is also pathetic. They tend to neglect basic things like replacing the toiletries. The bed was also not upto the mark. The housekeeping never even bothered to clean the carpet once in my stay i suppose as a small spill of peanuts which i made on the first day was there till i left. Room service never responded with a smile. Internet was one of the worst which i had seen at a sheraton..Overall I would say this hotel really needs to do a lot of work to change the outlook as well as how it looks inside. Checked out of the hotel and moved to the Renaissance even though its a bit expensive. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"a truly fabulous hotel with top notch service The hotel is not located in the middle of downtown but you can travel to all the major spots via metered cab ( the doorman is on standby there to get one for you esp. during rush hours, about 15 mins ) or take the metro ( 10 mins walking distance to the station and maximum 10 mins to downtown ). Two biggest exhibition centers are situated right next to the hotel – if you are traveling for any exhibitions, which will be perfect for you.Usually I don’t like to eat in the hotel’s restaurant, but since they offer some free drinks during that time, I tried the Italian restaurant on 27th floor, it turned out to be an impressive experience. The female Italian chef just arrived in town not long time and she exactly knows what she is doing and the food tastes awesome and you can have an excellent view of the city. I also had my business lunch on the 2nd floor’s Japanese restaurant, the service is again awesome and humble. The waitresses are running in the restaurant and just get what you want in a minute although it is pretty busy. The breakfast buffet again is fantastic, but if you don’t have enough time to eat there – they have a ‘grab and go’ counter right in the lobby, coffee and fresh bakeries. I really have to mention that the deli on the 2nd floor offers the most extensive selection of home made meat items – just like what I can find in Frankfurt, and lots of fresh pastries. I was told that this is the best bakery in Shanghai from one of the frequent guests I bumped into. Generally speaking, the staff is all courteous and the service is professional and humble, the front office girl wearing traditional Chinese qipao are very friendly and helpful and have a good knowledge of city happenings. The hotel room is very warm and cozy to me, it has an ‘East meets West‘ style which are very distinguished from other new hotels. The Sheraton’s signature sweet sleeper beds are very soft / fluffy and comfortable – I usually bring my own travel pillow but in here, I can sleep very well. The gym on the 5th floor has all the imported machines. If you have spare time, can also try the lovely Spa next to it.Another thing is the GM of the hotels sit in the lobby every morning during hotel’s rush hour, so if you have any problem, he is very approachable and willing to help. This is truly different from other hotels where you can never solve your problems because you can’t find the right person / decision makers.Last but not least, it is a worthy 5-star hotel and you’ve gotta try it. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"A SPECIAL LOCATION About location. This hotel is not in the centre, to the centre 15-30 minutes by taxi (about 50-70 RMB). The district is a special business district for foreigners (with girls also). There are expensive shops for local buyers, restaurants, but you have not a choice, like in the centre of city, where you can walk, go to 1000 of restaurants and see Shanghai life. The hotel. Nice, big hall. But...small rooms, WiFi is not complimentary (it is a racket!), small territory - no tennis court, no walking place, no garden (there is a garden - like a room). FOOD - at the top flour there is an Italian restaurant - expensive but not tasty! (There is a wine collection). Ground flour restaurant can make a poison - you shall not died but you shall think so. For this - the hotel is very expensive, I think.Good trip everybody!!! "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,Excellent hotel Excellent well appointed rooms with good location next to the exhibition centre 
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Exactly as expected from a Sheraton hotel Its always nice to come to a city to which you have never travelled before and feel home in a comfortable place.I have stayed at a few Sheratons before, so I knew roughly what to expect from the hotel.LOCATION:The location was perfect for me, it was not on the Bund or downtown, but more to the west side of the city. There is a Starbucks/McDonalds within 5 minutes walking distance and plenty of Chinese and other Asian restaurants around.The drive from the International airport to the hotel was about 45 minutes.CHECK IN:Smooth, professional, got the non-smoking room I requested for. Check in was quick at 17h00.ROOM:I believe I had a standard room. Nothing fancy, but a good bed. Big flatscreen with CNN and a handful of other international channels. No seperate shower (always a petty). The minibar was well stocked.BREAKFAST:Plenty of space, plenty of choice. Various Cheeses, sausages, juices, breads, etc, etc. Not the most choise Ive ever had, but again plenty of hotels I stayed in with less choice.OVERALL:A good hotel to stay if you can not afford time to get settled in a local/boutique hotel. At this hotel you know what you get and you will get it. The price you always pay with the big brand hotel is that there is very little charisma/character "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Terrific rooms and great breakfast I do not understand the negative reviews that this hotel received.I received free accommodation and breakfast as I won a competition, so I am trying to be careful that this does not overly bias my review.The lobby has two large chandeliers. Checkin was smooth with four clerks handling arivals, though I gather that occupancy was down to 60 per cent.Our 15th floor room and the accompanying hallway appeared to have been recently renovated, as had the business centre, fitness centre and admittedly small indorr swimming pool.The room was exceptionally quiet and presumably double-glazed even though it backed onto a freeway or tollway that seemed to only carry cars and motorcycles/ scotters (no noisy trucks were viewed).Beds were comfortable; the room had excellent lighting and a modern plasma television, as well as a large writing desk and trendy chair.Two complimentary bottles of tap water were provided each day, as were lotion, shampoo, conditioner and a reasonable range of teas plus plunger coffee.The bathroom had a modern glass bowl as its basin: I could not work out how to lower the plug. The bath was a reasonable size and again new, with a good sup-ply of hot water evident. There were six lights in the bathroom including one uplight, which gives some idea of the good standard of illumination.The wardrobe was a reasonable size. Breakfast on the ground floor was excellent: the only notable omissions were mango juice and cooked tomato (raw tomato was available). Everything else from breads, yoghurts, cold cuts, hot dishes and even dried mango, walnuts and cashews to place on one's cereal was available, as was the 'egg station' with two chefs to cook to order.As usual in this type of hotel, Internet through the business centre was extortionate at CNY7.5 for the first ten minutes then CNY1 per two minutes thereafter.The only other thing I found strange was that the mens' facilities near the swimming pool and fitness centre lacked showers: of course, one is able to walk up to one's room and shower. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Far Far Away Firstly i would say, Ok hotel with a very far away from almost everything. But still easy to reach if you land@Hongqiao airport. I would suggest anyone have to leave for this airport or train station(south terminal) Otherwise forget about it. IT to Far Away! Bellman and concierge very helpful. Subway is 4 block away 10 mins walk. Nothing much to see around except one shopping mall names ParkSon. Hotel is right next to Renaissance hotels. Reception also nice and helpful. Club lounge is ok but nothing to mention it. Check out process is super slow due to unprofessional staff i guess. Room ok, if you got suite pls. not take the one that similar like connecting room. Try to get room digit follow by XX01 only. that make your suite more space. Main restaurant is ok, buffet also fine. Atmosphere also fine as regular old fashion Sheraton. Only one problem so far, that Housekeeping did not do their job properly. Till night before checkout i desire to report to Duty manager. So in the morning Assistant front office manager promptly get back to me with a fantastic manner and result. I am really sincerely appreciate. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"OK but there are much better hotels for the money The Sheraton at Hongqiao is ok, and i didn't have some of the problems that previous reviewers encountered (esp the overbearing staff in the lobby, or having to pay for phone bookings via the concierge). The building is quite old and in some parts that really shows (e.g. bathrooms) At some point relatively recently they have tried to freshen the hotel up &amp; have updated the fit-out of the rooms. The location is lousy... a long way west of the city. Fine if you have a reason to stay this far west, but otherwise, you would NEVER choose to be this far away from the centre. The rooms are basic but fine. The furniture is dark wood &amp; old-fashioned but style aside, it does the job. Like other reviewers, I found the bed to be rock hard - uncomfortably so (and i like a hard bed). The air conditioning worked fine. The bathroom was a mix of new &amp; old. The shower had one of the oldest mixer taps i have ever seen, though the wash-basin and bathroom storage shelves were much newer glass (although showing scratches &amp; signs of age).The breakfast buffet was ok (incl in the room rate), although it was some of the worst coffee i have ever tasted. I didn't buy any other food or drinks from the hotel (so can't comment on other reviewers comments of high prices).All in all, it's a typical older Sheraton in a terrible location... and in Shanghai where there are so many other hotels, you really wouldn't choose to stay here. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Very average business hotel For the rate charged (around 1400 RMB), this is by no means a cheap alternative by Shanghai standards. The hotel staff hardly speaks English and the ones that do frequently misunderstood our orders. The room is alright, but nothing more.Beware of room service and restaurant prices, a complete rip-off and the quality of the food (at least at their Italian restaurant) is appalling. Paid over 800 RMB for a two course meal with a glass of champagne. The starter was borderline uneatable, the main course was overdone and the potatoes/sauce tasted very poor. The champagne (at 180 RMB per glass!) was poured up from an already opened bottle that was simmered and the carbon oxide nonexistent. Tasted really bad, and the waiter even tried getting away with a half full glass.The lobby is spacious but with teared seating - skip the food there and head somewhere else if you want an enjoyable dining experience.Would not recommend this hotel if a better alternative is on the table. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Sunday Brunch I didn't stay, just had Brunch there with friends and wanted to let others know about the GREAT value for money: For RMB 238 they serve literally hundreds of hot and cold dishes, from oysters to lobster to Sashimi, breakfast dishes, lunch dishes hot and cold, desserts....fantastic. In my view the best deal in town. There is also free-flow Sparkling Wine, beer and soft drinks.They have a Filippino Jazz trio entertaining from start to finish.Service is great, staff is friendly and (most) speak English :-) "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Very average for a Sheraton Stayed for work for a week. Hotel staff are all friendly and courteous. Ran meetings in the ball room for a week, function rooms are quite good. Food however is very sub par and expensive. Breakfast buffet is very expensive for what you get. Function package we had for morning/afternoon tea and lunch was horrible. Same bad food every day. Business center is also expensive for printing. Wouldn't really recommend it. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Excellent Business Hotel Stay in this hotel for 2 days in Jan 2008. Things I like: The hotel is new, room is well equiped. The staffs are well trained, courteous and very helpful. I felt the overall services is great and well ahead of most hotel in China. Things I dislike: Except for the below average breakfast and the pricey rate, there is no other weak link that I can pick on. However, maybe due to the focus to cater for bussiness traveller, everything seen so &quot;by the book&quot; that it lack the surprise element to really leave an impression.I will recommend the hotel to those who have to be in Shangahi because the job call for but not to those who are there for holiday. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Superb blend of east and west I spent 6 nights here on business. I was on the Starwood Preferred Guests Floor which was 19th out of 26. I can't speak for other floors, but my room was spacious, comfortable and thoroughly immaculate. Bathroom was completely new and modern. Seating and desk area was comfortable. The hotel in general is opulent and well staffed. It has wonderful Chinese styling so you don't feel like you are at home, but don't feel out of place either. There are attendants everywhere ready to help. It is a major ex pat hotel so English is pervasive. No language difficulties. They cater to English speakers and greatly helped directing taxi drivers and making reservations. I thought the room was reasonably priced, but everything else is way overpriced by local standards. Breakfast is near $30! Mini-bar items were twice what I'd expect even in NYC. This is surprising considering there were numerous local and more reasonable options available nearby. The PROS - right off of the highway makes it easy access for taxis. It is near a number of high-end department stores and numerous restaurants (including Starbucks for morning coffee and McD when you just need a french-fry fix.). Area is Westernized so you'll feel plenty comfortable exploring.The CONS - it is outside central loop, a good 20+ minutes to the Bund, and longer to Pudong. Area is Westernized so it lacks a local flavor. Not much by way of cheap local shops, most stores are higher priced (but not necessarily higher quality). It's a 15min walk to the nearest subway station so taxis are required, but they're cheap! "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Overall good but little mixed I stayed in one of the Club Rooms recently.Unfortunately, they could not give me a non smoking room, so had a smoking room, on promise 'it would not smell'. Admittedly, it did not - it was fine. However, the floor outside smelt like an ashtray! Very unpleasant everytime I walked to/from my room.The service overall was fine - if a little variable. Example in the Club room where most of the staff were prepared to help with anything - booking restaurants, booking taxis, recommending restaurants etc. However one of them (inexperienced possibly?) simply said (very nicely) to go to the concierge on the ground floor. not much help!Rooms were fine - average for a Sheraton, nothing special but clean, spacious &amp; comfortable, with Internet access, decent TV etc. as expected nowadays. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"oriental oppulence a top class hotel in the gube area which has a lot of western expats and therefore a lot of mixed restaurants in the district. This hotel offers everthing the discerning traveler would want, lovely foyer bar and restaurants, probably a touch out of the way but everything else makes up for this slight inconvenience "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Shanghai'd in Shanghai This is one of the worse run hotels I have been at in a long time. Typical Sheraton style - a lot of grandeur, but horrible service, facilities and overall experience. Food is god awful. No matter where you go or what you do in the hotel, it will cost you $$$. Ever hear of a $12 1.5 liter bottle of water? How about a $20 pizza? Better yet, $70 for coffee for four. I should have had the meeting at Starbucks.Outdated room decors, where fitted sheets seem to be unknown to the cleaning staff. Bathroom decor needs to be updated and more functional. Location is one of the hardest to get to in Shanghai. Unless you have a lot of money to spend for nothing, this is not a hotel for a business traveller. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"OK but... Like other contributors, this hotel is a mixed bag.The ground floor-lobby,bars,lounge is a mess. There are plenty of staff waiting to 'help', but there is an overbearing sensation. The piano keeps playing ad nauseum- it must drive the staff insane!Bedroom OK but smallish, staff polite, drinks too expensive, good breakfasts. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"I will never stay here again I stayed at the Sheraton Grand in Shanghai during a recent 3 week trip which included the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, the St. Regis in Beijing, the Red Capital Ranch at the Great Wall, the Peninsula in Hong Kong, and the JW Marriott in Shanghai.Our group's experience at the Sheraton was not good. As a Sheraton Grand property, I expected a hotel comparable to the others. The management of the Sheraton should visit these other properties to learn how to properly run a luxury hotel.Our first problem occured upon our arrival at the airport. We used the Sheraton's airport sedan service for our transfer from the airport to the hotel. The Sheraton touts that they use BMW sedans for this service. Yes, a BMW was provided, but when all the luggage would not fit in the trunk, the driver refused to put one of the carryon bags on the front passenger seat. We were forced to wait while a different vehicle was obtained. The driver of the Mercedes sedan at the Park Hyatt and the driver of the Rolls Royce at the Peninsula had no problem with placing a bag on the front seat.My room at the Sheraton was a suite on the club/executive floor. The suite was somewhat small, but adequate. However, there were so many unnecessary pieces of furniture and decorations in the room that it seemed tiny. The breakfast offering in the club lounge was marginal.The hotel attitude is definitely &quot;off&quot; for a luxury hotel. Five of us wanted to sit the lobby lounge while we waited for another member of our group to arrive. We sat down and 3 of the 5 ordered drinks, but 2 decided not to order anything. The waitress then informed us that everyone in the group must order something. Those not ordering are not allowed to sit in the lounge. Keep in mind tha there is not anywhere else to sit in the lobby while waiting.In the couple of days that we were at the Sheraton, there were a few similar occurances. For such a short stay we were amazed how many times our behavior conflicted with their rules. We decided to check out early and transfer the the JW Marriott (which we found to be an excellent hotel).There are signs placed around the hotel prohibiting various things. The feel is more of a military camp than a 5 star hotel.I believe these problems are probably due to management's reliance on strict enforcement of some rules, the results of which have not been fully considered. Overall, the staff was friendly and efficient, but they had to enforce &quot;the rules&quot;.During previous trips to Shanghai, I have stayed at the Jin Jiang (the old Jin Jiang, but in the new wing) and the Intercontinental. I would recommend both of these over the Sheraton and I would pick the JW Marriott as my first choice.The Sheraton property itself is very nice and convenient to conducting business on the West side of town, but this does not make up for the negatives. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"mixed feelings I have been staying 4 nights in the club executive room and I have some mixed feeling about everything, but this may possibly be said also for other chinese properties .Hotel is nicely kept though not young ,rooms are in a traditional american style (not mine definitely) bathrooms are small and a little be oldstyled .Equipments in the room is satisfying,beds confortable ,airconditioning so and so.Club room quite small and without toilets , so after the first two drinks you will need to go back to your room.Staff friendly in the chinese way (they say no more often than in any other country worldwide but probably that's how they are trained...you cannot leave your brifecase to the concierge if it contains a laptop !!! they charge you for tickets reconfirmation and restaurant boookings) .Prices of drinks in hotel is ridicolous with a beer or glass of wine close to 10 euros .Location also not primary , you are 30 minutes away from the bund without restaurants or interesting shopping malls nearby.Food at hotel is acceptable - over average if you go to the Italian restaurant.After having spent three weeks in other asian countries probably I got spoiled and the attitude found at this hotel was somehow confusing "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Great Hotel although a little overbearing This hotel is amazing. It definately deserves the five stars. I've stayed at plenty of Sheratons before but this one has got to be the best. The rooms were not only spacious but very very comfortable. Of course, that may be a reason why you chose Sheraton with their well known Heavenly bedsheets. The service is definately remarkable, botht the Concierge and other staff. There are literally 6-7 people greeting you when you enter the hotel, check in, etc... When you return to the hotel with even one tiny little bag, the staff will get it for you and bring it to your room. I've never had that service in the US, not even at W-Hotel. This may sound a bit overbearing, but hey you're getting the price you paid for. Would you rather have this service or some crappy service and room? As for the food, we didn't try the restaurants because there were so many choices outside of the hotel. The only bad thing about the hotel is that its not in the downtown area. But still, its only about $21 RMB ($3 USD) to take the taxi to the Pudong area (Downtown). I would most definately return to this Sheraton if I'm ever in Shanghai again. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Over-bearing over-attentive staff. This is a very grand-looking hotel with a lobby full of chandeliers, sculptures and marble. Got a room as a Gold Preferred Guest, it was very modern but not fully comfortable. When you first check in, Housekeeping would leave 2 rubber ducks by the tub and a teddy bear (and yes, a stuffed animal)on the bed that all have tags that say &quot;take me home.&quot; This could seem a little spooky as the first impression of the hotel room. And if you put the teddy bear away, it would reappear on the same spot night after night. The entire staff was very nice and polite, but no doubt they are all overly attentive and can be over-bearing at times. When you walk in and out, at least over 5 people say &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;good evening&quot; to you at the same time, and when you leave the restaurants, some of them would even put the jacket on for you. The hotel bar was just so-so, and the breakfast was okay. Room service was terrible. Gym was big but the equipment choices were very scattered (different treadmills, bikes, weights, etc.).All in all, stay there for the grandness and don't expect comfort of a hotel like home. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"nice hotel bad location The hotel is most definently a five star hotel, but there is one problem.The location of the hotel is realy bad! I went outside for a walk, and there is almost nothing to see! Also, I went about five minutes and about twenty people came over to me to ask me to buy something(watches,food,massage) It was not very comfortable.Regarding the rooms, I stayed in a regular room and it was just gorgeous!The furniture that the room provides was outstanding! If you are there on business then this is for sure a room for you! The service was also very good as the people in the hotel are very nice! Overall, the hotel is worth the stay but the location is not good like other hotels in Shanghai! "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Poor service of a Concierge staff I stayed at the Sheraton Grand Tai Ping Yang for two nights in end October. The staff are generally friendly and helpful apart from one concierge staff.On the first day, the concierge staff, Wilfred have kindly made few restaurant reservations for me. However, on the second day, when I asked another concierge staff, Franklin to make further reservation, he refused by lying that his telephone can only connect internal lines. I then queried why the staff can do so the previous day. He then asked my room no. and advised the phone charge will be billed to my room. I also queried why this was not requested the day before. He then even asked me to make the reservation myself and stated it is just a phone call! After much argument, he finally agreed to make the reservation but with much reluctance. I was really astonished with such a rude service provided by a Concierge from a 5 star hotel! I am a regular business traveller but have never encounterd such a poor service from any hotels in China or the Far East. I will not consider staying at this hotel again as the quality of staff is so inconsistent. "
sheraton shanghai hongqiao hotel ,"Almost Like Being Home Arrived late on a Friday from the US. Greeted by any surrounding staff as entering the Hotel and escorted to the front desk. Service was more attentitive than the parent Westin hotels are in the States. Stayed in a Club room and surroundings were quiet and very comfortable allowing a much needed sleep. Closet was well equipped with at a dozen hangers of differnt types, small safe, extra pillow (in case 5 on the bed weren't enough), an iron and full size ironing board. Bathroom had tub/shower, glass bowl sik and vanity, soaps, gels, lotion and shampoo, nail kit, shoe cloth, combs, toothbrush, sewing kit, most anything you might need and a couple of rubber ducks. Main room had a large flat screen lcd TV, bed, desk and chair, high speed internet connection (extra fee), sitting chair with coffee table, dressers and end tables. I'd guess it was about 400 sq. ft. Controls for HVAC were mounted on the wall easy to find and set. Had to unplug something to plug in the iron but it didn't mess up the full room light, fan &amp; tv controller that sits bedside.Drank and ate barfood in the first floor bar. It was western style food and looked and tasted as espected, good but not great. Had pants dry cleaned and pressed without difficulty.Rate paid was 1488 RMB ($180) plus 15% service fee, remember that tipping is not necessary since the Hotel adds it. Might be steep for a Sheraton in many US places but this was more like a Westin, it was once badged as a Westin.Returned twice more for a night each during a week of travels around the area and looked forward to returning each time.

sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Total chaos I want my money back. Not something you would expect from a hotel branded with the &quot;Sheraton&quot; logo.Its either they are still on their way to getting up to what international travelers expect of the Sheraton, or management really doesn't care.Below are the reasons why I couldn't recommend anyone to stay at the Sheraton Pudong. - ArrivalAs I arrived at the Sheraton Complex, my driver made a mistake and took me to the &quot;Four Points by Sheraton&quot; instead of the Sheraton Pudong. The porter at the Four Points was attentive, opened my door and was quick to service. I told him I was staying at the Sheraton Pudong, he kindly directed the taxi to the correct driveway.To my surprise, the Porter at the Sheraton Pudon was too busy chatting with his colleague, I had to flag him down so that he could help me with my bags. When I asked him if this was the Sheraton Pudong, he replied &quot;I don't speak English&quot;- Check-inThe lady at the check-in counter was either having a bad day or Chinese customs is to be cold to arriving customers. No smiles or thank you's were given. A very dry check-in. She did not even explain where the porter took my bags and who/where I was supposed to ask to get it delivered to my room until I asked her about it.- RoomThe rooms were decorated in a very nice matter. However, the details of the room finish were not what I expected. A lot of things were bolted/glued on crooked (like the faucet and the showerhead); it got me worrying about the construction of the building it self. However, housekeeping and other services were up to standards except the fact that when people come to deliver things to your room, (I guess since they do not speak English) they just grunt and hand you what is supposed to be delivered.- BreakfastService is HORRIBLE. First day, I was served a GLASS of hot tea, when others were given mugs. Not is that only weird but also dangerous!! Second day, someone gave away my seat while I was at the buffet. It took the restaurant forever to find me a seat, clear the table (which they only half cleaned). I had plates in my hand, no one offered to help me while I was waiting for a seat to be made. - Check outI used the in-room internet (for a fee). However, at check out they told me that no charges were on the room... nice that I didn't have to pay for it but, worries me that the reverse could happen. - Bell serviceI was advised to reserve a taxi since I was leaving at a busy time in the morning (9:00AM). The morning I was leaving, the bell desk/ concierge was so busy that no one was available to help me to retrieve my reservation. I decided to walk to the curb and ask the porter for the taxi that I reserved. The porter just asked for a room number (he has no documents to check if I was the correct person), then he asks where I was headed.... I had already given all details of my destination when I made my reservation. I bet that no reservation information was relayed to the porter and that I was just lucky that I didn't have to wait for a taxi. The verdict: the building it self is nice but expect motel 6 style hospitality. I stayed at the Intercontinental Pudong last year and had a waaaaaaay better experience. I recommend staying there instead if you are heading for Pudong. Sheraton, you really need to work on that hotel. Its a venue with a world class name and building but with negative service. If you're like this now, whats going to happen during the Expo?? "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Good quality hotel Very good quality hotel. large room, good service, good breakfast. Just a DVD reader missing and it would be perfect. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Nice but I wouldn't choose again... Arriving in Shanghai today our group of 7 took a taxi to the Four Points by Sheraton where we had reserved 5 rooms. Upon arrival we were told that there were no rooms available. I was very surprised because we had our confirmation papers with us.The Four Points staff told us that they would put us in the Sheraton Hotel nearby. We walked to the hotel and started to check-in. I was then informed that there were no rooms with king sized beds available. As I am particular about my bed due to back issues, I had reserved a king sized bed. Through some discussion I was placed in a smoking room (25th floor) with double beds. The room was very adequate with a nice view (but small window), but the beds were small.After 4 &quot;back-n-forth&quot; phone calls I was given a room with a king bed (12 floor). However, take a look at the view (in the photo). I get to look at another hotel directly out my window. Do not book this hotel expecting a nice view... even if you ask for it (as I did).One thing that I really look for in a 5-star hotel is a super bed experience... I like to sleep well and expect the best, plush beds... this Sheraton doesn't have great beds.It is only my first day here and the room is decent. The check-in problems were frustrating as I was on a timeline for completing some work in the afternoon. I am hopeful my experience from this point will improve. So far I would suggest considering another hotel.Other comments:* No wireless internet access* Very limited snack options in minibar* There is a French Press in the room for making coffee (this is terrific!)* In-room dining choices are limited and may only be for a very specific/limited palate: Goose liver??? Mushroom &amp; Jelly Fish sald??? "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Wonderful We very much enjoyed our stay of 4 days here. The breakfast &quot;buffet&quot; has to be seen to be believed. Various stations offer Japanese, Chinese cuisine, an egg station, juices, quality breads and jams, fruit galore etc.etc. offering a great start to the day. We lucked into incredible rates for our stay but they are probaly VERY competitive for a hotel of this class - it is a Sheraton class hotel as opposed to Chinese class/designed/constructed hotel with a western branded management. Of great benefit is the metro stop being right at the door of the hotel - so although the hotel is off the beaten tourist track, the subway makes it accessible to anywhere very conveniently - and it is nice at night to land at your doorstep. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Be careful startwood points not rewarded I would like to start by saying the hotel isexcellent and the service is 1st class.This the third time I have stayed there on my business trip to Shanghai. My complaint is that I am a starwood member, and so for each stay one is awarded points depending on the amount for final bill is.On this visit I booked two rooms on the internet vai what Sheraton customers services would call a third party. This was because this time when I was doing my booking I found the rate offered by Sheraton own site were much higher than when I booked through an agent. So obviously I went for the cheaper option. I paid $1200 for my stay with them , however I was informed when I complained about not reciving the points with the excuse that I had not booked directly with them so was not entiled to recieving points. So be aware that is you do not book directly with Sheraton you do not get your points. So to gets points you have to pay there inflated prices.When I travel with Emirates as long I fly with them they give there own points , they do not look at who have I booked with, However the Sheraton loylalty shceme does not do this.They have best rate guarantee,the complint procedure in complicated , once you do find a room you have to fill in complaints form.If there own website rate were not inflated in the first place, customers would not need to bother explaining to them. I "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Will definitely come back again. Booked 3 rooms, stayed 4 nights in late-July, can't be more pleased. Many previous reviews mentioned inconvenient location; now subway line 4 is completed with a stop right in front of the hotel. Shanghai has 8 subway lines now, it can take you to almost anywhere in the city within 30 minutes for only CNY4. Taxi is also cheap, under CNY30 (USD4.5) to most PuXi areas, CNY15 and less than 10 min. to Pudong Pearl Tower.For the hotel, it's at the high-end of a 5-star hotel. Room is spacious 42sqm with 2 'queen' size beds, rare in Shanghai. Pool, fitness, breakfast are all excellent. What's better, you pay a lot less than most 5-star hotels in Shanghai. The hotel is very close to 2010 Shanghai EXPO. Will definitely come back agin. Highly recommend. "

sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Good Value for Money We stayed at Sheraton Pudong for 4 nights back in February. This was the second time staying at the hotel. Similar to other reviews, we could not find anything wrong with the hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable and had everything you need. We tried both the coffee shop and the Chinese restaurant, both were OK. The location is very close to the airport train station. All in all, this is good value for money and we have no complaints on any aspects of the hotel. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great hotel with comfortable rooms in non centralised location for tourists yet ideal for business travelers Stayed here for 6 nights in May with my parent in a twin room. The bed was very comfortable and room size was huge and spacious. Previously stayed at the Four Points next to it and realised that Sheraton has bigger rooms, bathrooms and better facilities. If price is your consideration factor, Four Points offer more value for money.Sheraton has a gigantic bathroom with separate toilet, shower, and sink area. The shower has a bathtub and a separate shower feature with a rain shower facet on the ceiling. Very nice touch. I also like how the closet has doors that can be opened from both the room and the bathroom, very convenient as one does not have to bring the clothes into the bathroom.Facilities wise, the health club is great. Pool was nice, and fitness centre was also above average. Free internet kiosk and printing available at lobby area. Highly convenient and helpful for people needing to print stuffs.Food wise, My mum and I had a few meals at the Chinese restaurant and we found it affordable with excellent food selection and offering tasty dishes. Also ordered room service once and found it to be good and affordable with wide and decent selection.Restaurants are very helpful as the hotel location is not very ideal. Taxi is cheap, though, and one will most likely be taking the cab frequently when you stay here. There is a subway station directly in front of the hotel and offers a cheap and efficient way to get to the touristy area over the river in Huang Pu. I had to take the train once as no cabs were willing to drive me into Xintiandi for a dinner appointment I had. The train ride was fast and despite having to change line twice(!) I reached Xintiandi under 30 minutes.If you are a business traveler and need to frequent Pudong, then this hotel will be great for you as cab into Pudong is under 10 minutes and will not set you more than 15 Chinese Yuan (around US$2). "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"top notch hotel Just took a quick 3-day getaway trip to Shanghai, and chose this hotel as part of the air-and-stay package. My first 2 choices were sold out so I had to &quot;settle&quot; for this hotel. I guess it's not a popular hotel because of its location (on the Pudong side, and not walkable to TV &quot;Oriental Pearl&quot; tower).The location may not be perfect for some, but the hotel is right on top of the subway station. It takes less than 45 mins to get from the Pudong airport using the Maglev highspeed train and subway (side note: the frenquency of the subway can be quite low during weekend, about every 15 mins). And the city is covered by multiple subway lines (up to 8 now). As a last resort, taxi is very affordable.What impresses me the most is the well appointed guest room. Everything you need, they have it. The rain shower is a nice touch that is not often found in others. TV with lots of channels, nice bedding, separate toilet stall, I just cannot find any faults. However, I must caution about something I found in many hotels in China. For some reasons, the materials used in renovation/furnishing get worn out pretty quickly (I already found little cracks in the stone tiles in the bathroom), so rooms may not be as impressive in a couple years.Used their gym as well, very spacious. It's set up in a long corridor style room, most equipment facing the garden, so it gives guests a very tranquil feeling while exercising. I took a peak at the pool and locker room area (which has a steam room), all very nice. And for some reasons, only few people used the facilities (I went around 6:30-7:00am), so that's great.As part of the package, the breakfast buffet is included. Lots of items to choose from. Particularly enjoyed their pastry and cold section (cereal, salad). Great service throughout, I was able to leisurely enjoy the food, while browsing the internet (free on the ground floor of the hotel).Overall service standards are very high, any inquiries and problems were answered/solved promptly. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Don't drink the water Room very good but prices for drinks and services a rip off.RMB 78 (GBP 7.50) for a bottle of water, RMB 50 for an hour on the Internet &amp; RMB 60 for a tomato juice.This is China. Does the management expect you to haggle as you have to with the other pirates in Pudong. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"No Complaints Very nice new hotel. Free internet access in lobby for your own laptop, plus they had 6 desktops (link@sheraton which is a great thing) free for use.Breakfast was included in my rate, and was good and ample.The hotel, and the Four Points next to it, are located in front of the Tang Qiao metro stop, line 4. The metro costs 4RMB per ride. To get to the maglev station, go to Long Yand Rd station on line 2. You have to change trains at Century Avenue, but it's easy enough. The maglev is 50RMB each way, or 80RMB roundtrip within 7 days. The maglev ride is 8 minutes, plus about 20-25 minutes on the metro to/from the hotel stop.The hotel is not in the heart of Pudong where the big buildings are, but it's all a metro ride away. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,Very nice hotel Stayed at Sheraton Pudong for 3 nights on business trip in December 2008. As a business hotel it was very good with free wireless internet in the lobby. Room internet was overpriced as it is in every upscale hotel (I never understand this).The breakfast buffet was varied and food tasted great. Dim Sum station also included.One complaint was the lobby bar was very impersonal and had a very abandoned feel. The hotel tries to spruce it up with live music but not a very good result. 
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Pudong in Shanghai in November 2008. The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located near a subway entrance.After a very long day of travel with our patience running low and attitudes about to take a turn for the worst, we were incredibly happy to check into our beautiful, comfortable room. I have stayed at many great hotels, but this may be one of the nicest - we actually took out our cameras and took a few photos before unpacking because it was soooooo nice. It was a really welcome surprise that changed our mood immediately.New, spacious room with an incredibly comfortable bed, chaise, lovely bathroom, fluffy robes, nice amenities. Perfect.The buffet breakfast downstairs is one of the nicest I have ever had. It became my favorite meal of the day. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great modern part of China. The hotel was very nice and the staff are helpful. Location was great, and it was walking distance to the train. It was not too far from the main attractions, just a 15-20 min cab ride. The room was comfortable. Cleanliness is not a problem. Staffs are helpful. The bed is just right, you can have a good night sleep at night. It was a good stay. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Just about a pass mark Stayed in Sheraton Pudong for three nights whilst on business to Shanghai. The hotel is about a year old and in good order.Quibbles about usual things really. Shanghai is expensive but food and drinks in this establishment do not represent good value. (Check the back of the restaurant menu and you will find set meals for 90 RMB, but no staff member will point this out)Concerned also about the cost of internet access in the rooms although this is provided free of charge in the lobby area.SPG rewards and upgrade entitlement the usual mystery with the 3 points for every $ spent simply not being credited.Location is ok next to the cheap and cheerful four points sister hotel and less expensive shopping mall which has several cheaper food outlets. And as usual in Shanghai you are only a short hair raising taxi journey away from venues on both sides of the big river... The Bund remains building site as things gear up for Expo infrastructure requirements so best avoided for now.I would stay here again, as its clean, quiet and a relative short hop in taxi from PVG via Maglev station at Longyuan. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Wow! Wow, this hotel far exceeded my expectation. The service was impeccable. The best I've experienced in China.I am surprised at the comments about the &quot;bad location&quot;. The location isn't &quot;bad&quot;. It's in Pudong, the business district, away from the tourist spots. But the subway stop is literally on the hotel plaza. In general, the subway in Shanghai is the way to go around the city because of the traffic. By subway, it's 15 - 20 minutes to downtown Shanghai, and it's really convenient to the Pudong airport, being only 10 minutes cab ride away from the Maglev. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great hotel swish rooms The Sheraton Pudong in Shanghai is a brilliant hotel.The rooms are beautifully decorated, with all items. The bathroom is immaculate with both rain shower and bath.Great wardrobe, safe etc. The breakfast is amazing.There is also a great fitness centre with a large swimming pool and a very well equipped gym.The location is not bad - but ok for business not as a tourist. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Beautiful hotel not a great tourist location Similar to others' posts, I agree that this is a very beautiful hotel, very good service howver not in an exciting location. Because it's a new hotel I had some difficulty with taxis finding it, even with the hotel's business card. The metro/subway station across the street is the Line 4/Brown/Pudong Nan Lu station and if you take a taxi from the Pudong airport to this hotel it will cost you about 125-150 RMB. It's a quick 10 minute ride from the hotel to the business district in Pudong, about 15 RMB. For business travel, I'd highly recommend staying here. For tourist travel, the location is not ideal as you'll need to take taxis or cabs everywhere. Also, there isn't much immediately around the hotel for a quick bite to eat or a quick mart to pick a few things up. I was upgraded but the rooms are the same on all levels as I had colleagues traveling with me and their rooms on lower levels were the same. Their breakfast is very big and diverse. Rooms come fully equipped with all your needs (safe, iron, hairdryer, etc.) and the beds are quite comfortable. The hotel front desk speaks English quite well and are very helpful, as my Mandarin needs help, so they can help you get to some of the major tourist sites by writing things in Mandarin for you. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great stay bad location Great stay, first class all the way. Location could be better. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great rooms great service funny location I have stayed here a couple times, and plan to come back. While it is a bit far as the crow flies from the Lujiazui central business area, the cab ride is really fast along the river. If you need to go across to Puxi, you probably want to find a place on the other side of the river. The hotel is also located at a subway stop which can access pretty much anywhere in the city within 45 minutes.The rooms are not huge, but very well executed. Cool views out over Pudong and the Yangpu bridge from upper floors. Excellent breakfast. Won't do anything for your diet, but the fresh croissants are really good. Also had a good room service dinner... Nasi Goreng. Another good food option is a small grocery in the basement of the department store next door. Fresh sushi and similar items.Concierges went above and beyond to help me with some issues (lost luggage). "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Excellent value in Shanghai I travel to China very frequently, and you cannot imagine the hotel horrors I have been through. Sheraton has done a brilliant job in Shanghai. It's very good value. For the price of the usual two - three stars, you get a close to downtown location in Pudong - very important if you're travelling on business. It means staying off from the manic traffic to and fro the Puxi side, where other hotel at same price levels are usually located. The bed is excellent with plush supportive down pillows. The bathroom is large and immaculately clean. It even comes with a 'rainforest' shower.I just had a few problems during my stay there. But these are unrelated to the staff. I've found the wardrobe that opens and closes in both the bedroom and bathroom a bit werid. Same as glass pane door for my loo, and finding the bathtub inside another glass pane designed to be the shower. (The designer had too much fun with these.The bathroom is a bit overdone in my opinion.)Also, the bedside switches only control the reading lights and the lights near the door. It's a bit annoying that I have to switch off the desk lamp and the lamp next to the sofa.Other than that, the staff are friendly and smart. It was a very quick checkin. The food is nice. The staff don't expect to be tipped. (Usual when you pay, other places return your changes with loads of coins, expecting you to leave some behind. In Sheraton, they hand you all the changes in notes with both hands.)All in all, I have enjoyed my stay in Shanghai. If Sheraton can do something similar in Beijing - that would make me very happy. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Great hotel I enjoyed it This is a new hotel located in the Pudong District. There is also a Four Points Sheraton located right next door, which is somewhat confusing to taxi drivers though mine were always able to get me to the hotel from the airport or other locations. There is a subway station located in front of the hotel. I had an Executive Room and found it to be very nice, the bed was firm but not too hard, much better than most China hotel beds. There is a large flat screen TV in the room and a nice desk work area with free internet access. My room offered a view of the Huang Pu River and while not particularly scenic, it is very interesting to watch the high volume of ship traffic. The restaurant has an excellent selection for breakfast with a buffet style selection of Asian and Western foods with fruits, cereals and pastries. The dinner menu is pretty much Western food and acceptable. Lunch can be ordered ala carte or buffet and again the buffet offered an excellent selection of food. I stayed during the snow storm of January 2008 and the attendants were helpful in getting cabs and encouraged the guests to wait indoor to stay out of the cold. There is a bar area in the lobby area. My business required me to check in, leave for travel and then check in again during a 1 week period and both check ins and check outs were efficient. Because of the snow storm, I did not walk around the area but didn’t see too much of interest in the area. The room had no problem staying warm. A taxi ride to the Standard Brand Mall and Pearl Tower area is only about 10 minutes. A taxi to Pudong Airport takes around 45 minutes. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Good Hotel Inconvenient Location A very nice, new hotel with a very helpful and friendly staff. It was still their &quot;soft opening&quot;, but everything seemed to be running like clockwork. I was upgraded to a suite that was really quite nice. The only downside is that the hotel is not convenient to the central Pudong area or to the Bund, etc. Also it is not well known yet to the taxi drivers. Even with hotel's card, with the name and map in Chinese, it was a crapshoot what would happen trying to get back in a taxi. One taxi driver took me a few blocks and dropped me at another taxi queue (without charge) because she didn't know where it was. The next one took me to the Hilton first (the pronunciation of Hilton to a native Chinese is apparently not far from Sheraton, interestingly). It was a hassle. The one advantage of the location is that it is closer to the airport than hotels that are more centrally located. And although the place is out of the way there was never a problem getting a taxi from the hotel. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Loved it I stayed in June 2007 over a weekend.Although the hotel is newly opened (and still has the &quot;new&quot; smell), the staff is just GREAT. Helpful, nothing is too much, they go out of their way to say &quot;Hello&quot; and assist guests with anything!Someone lost his mobile in a taxi and they didn't rest until the phone was returned!Great experience.Thomas "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"great hotel not good location Although this hotel is locating at Pudong area, it is a little far away from downtown pudong, around 15 mins by taxi. As a SPG plus member I was upgraded to the prefereed floor, but I didnt see any difference except the high floor. From my room I could see the beautiful skyline of pudong area, charming! The room was very clean, big and comfortable. Bathroom was big with two doors, one was opened to the corridor and another door was facing to the bed. Water pressure was ok though, the Forest Rain shower head was not as good as the one of Westin Shanghai. the only thing I didnt like was the internet was so expensive, about 7 dollar for one hour! "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"Friendly New Hotel Our group was booked at the Sheraton Hotel in Pudong last week since we had a regional meeting in Shanghai. Upon arrival at the hotel, I immediately noticed that this place is new and has elegant interiors. All the staff I met, from the bellhop to the front desk, were very courteous.The room I got was fairly large and with nice modern furnishings. I had a comfortable king size bed, a flat screen TV, and a big shower room and bath tub with a separate cubicle for the toilet. As mentioned in the previous post, I had no trouble sleeping because of the lovely bed and pillows plus I did not hear any noise coming from outside the room. Although there were different rates for internet access in the room, we were able to arrange with the hotel for our group to have free access to check our e-mail and browse the web.Breakfast buffet was not a problem since there were plenty of food to choose from. If you are not in a hurry, it is better to have your breakfast after 8am when there are less people in the restaurant. The place was a little packed when I had breakfast before 7am.There was one problem though that I encountered during my first night's stay. The door of my room had a defective lock since it can be opened from outside even without using a keycard. I called the front desk about this and they sent their engineering guys to fix it. After spending some time trying to do some repairs, they finally decided to replace the entire locking mechanism. The manager of the hotel sent me a fruit platter as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience this caused me. "
sheraton shanghai hotel residences pudong ,"New hotel - still working out the kinks Stayed here for one night in April 2007; were told at check-in that the hotel had only been open for one week. Rooms are large and comfortable, and I would recommend staying at a Sheraton hotel simply for their mattresses. They have much softer mattresses than any other hotel I've stayed at in China (most places feel like you are sleeping on a board). The sheets on our beds felt like they were brand new and never washed; they felt stiff and scratchy. There was a light in front of the door that we couldn't turn off, as it did not seem to be wired to any of the switches in the room. It was the last night of an almost 3-week long trip though, so we were too tired to be bothered by it. The pool and health club are not open yet, the minibar was not fully stocked, and they have only a limited room service menu (had to call to ask for a menu as there was not one in the room, and they made us turn it back in after we'd ordered). The location is near to attractions such as the Bund and the TV Tower (which was visible from my window), a 40 - 60 minute cab ride from the international airport, and about a 30 minute ride from the domestic airport. Staff here are all very new, and act like &quot;trainees&quot;; we were taken on a tour of our room, accompanied by two staff members when all we really wanted was a speedy check-in and some privacy. There is also still some construction work in progress on some of the guest floors. I would stay here again, but hopefully by that time they will have worked out the kinks (and washed the sheets!)

sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Don't be fooled by the pretty lobby Stayed at the Sofitel Shanghai Hyland for three days in November and was somewhat disappointed. This hotel didn't get top ratings from Trip Advisor reviews and I was somewhat reluctant to book it, but I received a great three-for-two-nights deal on hotels.com. Upon arriving, the lobby was spectacular and I began to feel better about my choice.--until I got to my room on the 10t floor. I choose not to upgrade to the Executive Level as was offered upon check-in (for about $50 a night). So I imagine the lower floors are for discount bookings and the rooms are certainly not up to the standard of this luxury chain. Nothing really bad, just pretty dated with a very small and old bathroom. Not much of a view, either. Beds were very hard, as is often the case in Asian hotels. The hallways were dark and dingy. Service was sullen and the concierge didn't even look up from his phone conversation when I stood there for at least 10 minutes. One afternoon upon returning to my room, it had been made up, but the roll of toilet paper was missing. (As a single male traveler, I was approached by prostitutes quite often right outside of the hotel, but I guess that's not the hotel's fault) I hope (and suspect) that the rooms and service on the Executive level are better. I did not eat at the hotel.On the plus side, the location is right on the main shopping street and within easy walking distance to most attractions and very close to the subway. Lots of restaurants in the area, and tons of mall-type shops. I also had free WiFi which was not supposed to be included. I suppose on the lower floors you can still access the WiFi from the lobby area. Lots of international news and entertainment channels. Overall, not a terrible experience, but also not one that lives up to the expectations of a Sofitel hotel. This would be a nice three star place, and if you understand that going in, you will likely be satisfied. Unless I got a great deal, I would not stay there again, as Shanghai has a lot of upscale hotels in the vicinity. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Thumbs up! Up to expectations! Reasonable price in a good location. Service was good and we enjoyed our stay. We would recommend this hotel. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Superb Location The lobby's a nice European iintimate feel, unlike the grand high celing entrance that most luxury hotels in China tend to favour. The same cannot be said about the basic room that we had. The carpet's dirty, the bathroom not so well furnished and generally tired looking. Upgrade yourself to a club room instead if you've come to expect what a Sofitel normally offers. The location however, is what keeps this hotel's rates up. Step outside the hotel is , you're in the middle of the Nanjing Walking Street which stretches over a km , filled with shops, shops and more shops, and very good for people watching as well, if you're sitting by their walkway cafe. There're at least two Metro stops linking to different lines along this stretch, and one can talk a leisurely stroll to the Bund. Remember to ask for their complimentary Shanghai Guide, that comes with a nice illustration of all the tourist attractions and the different metro lines, much better than the map I bought from a bookshop. Breakfast is nice, freshly squeezed juices, more European pastries than local fares, egg stations, just enough for a good hearty start for the day.Like other posters had mentioned, the Concierge seems more interested in talking to each other than serving the guests. A little more professionalism is desired. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good location - but very business focused The Sofitel has a good location within easy walking distance to People's Square and the Bund and is right next to a subway stop. The hotel has a poor bar - the other local hotel bars are much better - especially the Marriot and Radisson.The rooms were clean and fine, but the hotel is very business focused which comes as a bit of a shock after staying in a boutique hotel in Beijing, The breakfast is not included and about £20 and wireless is also charged for at around £12 a day - both included in my previous hotel.I went on a half-day trip organised by the hotel to zhouzhuang water village. The guide was terrible and rushed us round at breakneck speed. None of the other guest were very happy with it.,When next in Shanghai I think I'd pick a similer area, but probabaly a different hotel. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Our stay at your hotel made our visit to Shanghai even more enjoyable. Checking in we were greeted with a cool drink and friendly, courteous staff who inform us of the usuall details one needs to know.Our room ( suite) was spacious, beutifully furnished and the amenities were excellent so was the view of the city from our windowsThe premises were well located adjacent to a square and shopping pedestrian street (Nanjing East) not far from the Bund. The metro was within five minute walk and taxis at the hotel door.Unfornutely we spent all of our time vising place and shopping. We did get much time to enjoy the available facilities.Breakfast at the 30th floor was the best ever. Your can request your choice from menu and/or have a variety of oriental and continental choices including juices and fruit. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Superb location and very comfortable hotel - at club level The Sofitel Shanghai is in an enviable location on the pedestrianised Nanjing Road shopping street, in the heart of the city - although it has several entrance levels and is a little confusing. I started to check-in in the main lobby but was then sent up to the club level to complete it. The room was in a traditional style, comfortable and well appointed with all amenities (tissues, safe, coffee/tea, toiletries, turn-down service). It had a bedroom with separate lounge area. I had club level access, where a superb and extensive breakfast was served. Happy hour complimentary drinks and snacks were available in the early evening, together with free internet (note, no Facebook in China!) and newspapers. The staff here were very friendly and helpful. I never had to go to the other restaurants in the hotel.Being a Sofitel, the hotel had a sophisticated French ambiance about it, which added to the level of comfort and overall experience.Shanghai itself is fascinating to explore with many sights. Its also dirty, dusty, noisy, smelly and consistently overcast with pollution. I have also never encountered as much constant hassle (albeit non-threatening) from people selling watches, bags, phones and sex, which was increasingly annoying as my visit continued. Also be warned that the city is preparing for the 2010 Expo, so the Bund was completely closed for reconstruction and other locations are also vulnerable to disruption in this period.Overall, the Sofitel exceeded expectations. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"terrible Sofitel dirty and dated... When you usually book for a Sofitel, at least you expect a high standard of service and a clean place... Not only an hotel well located cause i have to admit the location of Sofitel Hyland is really good, close for shopping, sightseeing and nightlife. But are you ready to pay more than 1500 CNY minimum just for location??? I'm sure if this topic is the only one you consider as important, there are other hotels all around at a better price cause this Sofitel is really expensive for what it offers.Maybe you'll be surprised by this review when you'll get in the hotel if you decide to go. Actually, they invest everything in the lobby which is quite trendy with nice flowers arrangement but you'll understand better when you'll start your check in... First of all, the staff is not really helpful nor smily. At the reception,they treat you as a number and not as a human and it's pretty disagreable and moreover cause they're especially arrogant. However, let's say i've been unlucky and maybe some of the staff working at the front desk are nice... At least, at the restaurant, the staff is really good and the impression about the place has been good: smily and efficient staff, good presentation (very good dinner buffet), nice food, large choice...But the worst thing in this hotel is when you get into the floors... The corridors are dark and the carpet smells bad. Cleanliness is one of the most important thing in an hotel and it's unacceptable a five stars hotel can be that dirty. Same thing when you'll discover your room: dated, with old furniture, dirty carpet with a lot of spots (quite disguting...), smudge in the bathroom and around the toilets where you'll find hairs of the previous customers, very out dated equipment (shower system, bathtub, lighting, TV...)... No need to talk about the size of the room or bathroom and i hope you'll travel just by yourself cause it's not the standard of a five stars hotel not even the one of a four stars. To compare, the Novotel Peace Beijing is better, much better. The only positive point is the Sofitel &quot;My Bed&quot; very comfy but again, is it good when you wake up with insects (i prefer not to think which kind of insects...) bites on your legs...???Sincerely, i really really don't recommend this hotel and moreover cause Shanghai has so much to offer... This hotel has nothing from the standard of a Sofitel hotel and more especially cause this brand is really upgrading all the hotels of the group but why are they forgetting this one??? "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Worth the money Comfy, modern cozy hotel, smack in the middle of it all. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Top Hotel positioned perfectly to enjoy the buzz of Shanghai. Top Hotel to stay at,with an upgrade to executive level a must.You pay extra,but with free full breakfasts,finger food &amp; drinks of an evening,free internet access&amp;newspapers,it's well worth the extra.The staff are a delight to deal with &amp; with the front door leading into the mall,this is the place to stay in Shanghai.My only concern was smoking on a non smoking floor.When in Shanghai again I will definitely stay at the Sofitel Shanghai Hyland.

There were also nice books in the libary about China and free Internet stations. Breakfast fast superb, especially the Croissant - best ever!

sofitel shanghai hyland ,"The perfect location to stay in shanghai Being a middle class retired couple, we found that having our hotel in the centre of all that's happening in Shanghai could not have been better.Being in the centre of the pedestrian mall that is Nanging Road, with all its shops and restuarants etc, meant that we were able to walk to our destinations easily. On our first outing in Nanging Road mall, we took a ride on the tram/trolley that takes you from one end of the mall to the other- a great way to get a grip on the area, and as my husband has trouble walking, this was a great introduction. Cost about RMB 2 which is about 30 cents Australian each way- pay on the trolley.The Bund is being renovated for expo, and massive works means that you cannot see anything from the roadway. The best view, and the most relaxing is to take a ferry cruise on the river . Fabulous and very worthwhile.Shopping - cost of most goods seems to be about similar or a little cheaper than in Australia, but if you are looking for &quot;copy&quot; bags, watches etc in the well known brands, you will be inundated with offers to take you to these shops, by gentlemen in the street. We were a bit nervous, but agreed to accompany as long as it was within walking distance to our hotel. We were suprised to be taken only one street off Nanging road, and happily bartered down the costs of handbags fron $200 to $45. excellent leather bags and wallets.We tried the same thing a few days later in HongKong, but prices there were much higher.The best day trip was to the Water town of Zhou Zhuang. You need all day there and stay for lunch/dinner if possible. We unfortunately included this town in with a trip to the garden town of Suzhou, and were sorry we had not allowed more time at Zhou Zhuang, even though we had our own private hire car for the day.We booked it through Shanghai Eastern Taxi Service, who also picked us up at the airport on our arrival. Great service , and great to have someone meet you on arrival. Contact Shanghai Eastern Taxi Service at info@shanghai-taxi.com for reliable pricing and info prior to your departure from home. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Avoid unless you have club level rooms - total rip-off and prosititution outside. Avoid at all costs unless you have club level rooms. We had a booking for about £100 but on check in they tried to 'upgrade' us to a club level room at about £150 including breakfast. We declined the upgrade. Our room was smoky and on calling reception was told they would try and change us that evening...Then went to the tiny tiny bathroom - tiles were cracked and the toilet seat and toilet seat cover were different colours and different plastics...the whole room had a dated 1970's feel. It was not modern or fresh. The TV was not flat screen - everywhere else in China (apart from, interestingly, another 5 star hotel in Shanghai) had flat screen TVs - Chinese motel chains at £38 a night, local 'boutique' hotels in Beijing at £33 a night...so for £100 a night I was kind of hoping for all the timmings and then some that I'd been able to enjoy elsewhere!No bathrobes either or slippers (fundamental to a stay in China for various reasons - ours were replaced every day at the £33 hotel in Beijing!).The area is poor - central but very, very sleazy. Husband was approached about 5 times in the near area for sex begiinning at 6 p.m. so hardly that late!. The location around Nanjing Road East and Peoples Square is not somewhere I would stay with children (or recommend to anyone else who isn't a sex tourist). We checked out pretty quickly and moved on elsewhere. This was problematic. They were determined that we stay but after a 50 minute wait and debate we were able to finally leave. See my other reviews for where we went - that place is HIGHLY recommended. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Hotel great location great service great breakfast We stayed in a suite on the club level. The room was very comfortable with incredible views of Shanghai. We received a gift of a bottle of wine, fresh fruit and pastries. The free breakfast offered with the club level was outstanding. The buffet was great plus we could order many items off of a menu.Unfortunately, during our stay, I suffered a medical emergency. The hotel provided a wheelchair and a driver to take me to a western doctor. This service was greatly appreciated. "

sofitel shanghai hyland ,"GOOD HOTEL IN GREAT POSITION We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel in March after we had finished a month of cruising and travelling around China and Far East Asia.Upon checking in, we were upgraded to a lovely suite on a high floor which consisted of a hall, lounge room, bedroom and bathroom with views over the city. This was a very pleasant surprise.We had booked a Club Room and enjoyed the facilities provided especially the breakfast and the drinks and nibbles at night.We also ate downstairs a couple of times at the coffee shop in the hotel which had reasonable food but very slow service. The position of the Sofitel is fantastic, right in the heart of the shopping area and close to most tourist attractions. We had a very enjoyable stay at this very comfortable hotel. "

We were given a complimentary fruit juice and a platter of fruit in our room. The room was moderately sized with a very comfortable bed, lounge chair, desk with free Internet connection, TV, minibar and wardrobe. The bathroom had a separate shower and low bathtub. Bathroom products were made by L'Occitane.Breakfast is served in the club lounge on the 30th floor, which has fantastic city views and provides delicious and beautifully presented food. There is an a la carte selection of hot dishes (eggs, pancakes, waffles, Asian soups etc) and a continental buffet including fresh bread, pastries, tropical fruit, cold cuts, cheese, jams, fruit juices and more.Complimentary club level evening drinks are served in the club lounge between 6-8pm. Wine (French, Australian, Chilean and Chinese white and red), beer, softdrink and fruit juice were offered along with hot and cold canapes that were brought to the table. The other end of the club lounge has a library/lounge area with 3 free Internet terminals. Most, if not all staff spoke English and were courteous. The concierge staff were helpful in booking tickets for us and for giving instructions in Chinese for the taxis. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Fantastic hotel ~ pity about the bar The title just about sums my experience up. You could not ask for a better location, the food selection for breakfast is top class, the rooms are &quot;western size&quot;, the staff are very friendly and efficient, but the flash bar just does not cut the mustard. It is way too formal and impersonal. This is the only part of the place that lets it down ~ a very important part for a solo traveller ! Not the cheapest place I have ever stayed in, but hey ~ when you are travelling, you don't want to be eating Big Macs every day !!! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Location and service I will not be inventive when I will say that the hotel has the best location of the city right on the pedestrian Nanjing road along which you have all the shops and malls you could dream of. It is also just a 10 minutes walk away from the Bund.The hotel, although old, has been renovated. The lobby is cosy and ''small'' in a good way except if you like the usual Chinese gigantic unfriendly lobby. The bar, located on the same floor is very intimate. The coffee shop, also on the same floor is offering a very nice interactive buffet which gives a great freedom of choice. The night time gives all these locations a totally different ambiance thanks to the lighting.The executive lounge on the last floor shows a great view of the city. The service is caring, the breakfast tasty and diverse with both buffet and a la carte and the evening cocktail time friendly and warm.The rooms are nice and not shabby as I read in some previous posts. The bed is in particular very comfortable. The bathroom may be a bit small but still has separate bathtub and shower. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Right on Walking Street If you are looking for a hotel on &quot;Walking Street&quot; then look no further than Sofitel Hyland.During my stay in China I have used the hotel on numerous occassions and have never been disappointed.The hotel backs onto &quot;Walking Street&quot; but beware of young ladies who offer to take you for &quot;sexy dancing&quot; as it will be an expensive night out. If you decline their offer within a few moments you will be another service by young men. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"A great location for a stay in Shanghai This hotel is very similar to other Sofitels in China. The rooms are quite nice, although not particularly spacious. I didn't find the property at all 'old and tired.' The location is great, on the pedestrian portion of Nanjing Road. You will be accosted with the usual &quot;watches, bags, DVDs, jeans) a hundred times a day in this part of town, but 99% of them will give up on you (a) if you are wearing an iPod and pretend not to hear them or (b) you continue talking with a friend as if they weren't there. Despite the very busy location, the hotel is very quiet. The view from my room was terrific -- overlooking a bandstand and the Central Hotel. Check out the terrace on the 7th floor -- it is very peaceful and has great views of the city (day and night). at 1200 CNY/night (plus 15% taxes) it is not cheap, but is comparably priced to the other places I've stayed in town (Jin Jiang on Moaming Road and Swissotel near Jing'An Temple). The food is okay, but perhaps a bit sub-par for a 'luxury' hotel. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good hotel and staff- disgusting food No complaints about the actual hotel itself. Most of the staff are very helpful. The major let down is the disgusting food.We went for a burger in their Mosiac Restaurant. The meat was rancid. I was physically ill after 1 bite. Interestingly, the Manager did not seem to care at all.Breakfast was just as bad. Off cheese. Half cooked eggs. Just nowhere up to standard and will NOT be back "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Very good hotel in a great location The Sofitel Hyland offers a very comfortable, modern experience in amongst the hustle and bustle that is Shanghai. City centre hotels are very often compromised by space or lack of facilities, but the Sofitel Hyland manages to offer excellent facilities with bright spacious rooms and to a very high standard. This hotel is located in one of the main shopping precincts in the city, yet is located a 10 minute walk from The Bund. If the hotel restaurants don't take your fancy, there is a multitude of places right on your doorstep, or just a short taxi ride away.The hotel is modern in styling, but comfortably so, by that I mean that it has enough interest in its features without some of the quirks that other 'modern' hotels come up with. The hotel staff manage to hit the right balance of being both welcoming and efficient. Having had a couple of bad experiences with checking in on this trip, I am pleased to report that the check in/check out process was very efficient "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good location good hotel for leisure or business Surprisingly good service and friendliness for shanghai. Located right on Nanjing road but quiet and secure. French and asian style good quality food. AF/KLM affiliated. Rooms good size with good amenities, concierge quick and helpful. 15 minutes walk to Bund or shanghai Museum. Hagen Daaz beside entrance and Starbucks closeby. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Beautiful hotel Amazing location! We had the most amazing stay at the Sofitel Shanghai. We stayed for 4 nights and were upgraded to a suite as soon as we checked in! Fantastic staff. Very, very nice and helpful. What ever we needed, they helped us. The bar is great and very relaxing. There's an amazing pianist that plays popular songs all night, great when your relaxing, and enjoying a drink. It was very clean, and very spacious. The restaurant and buffet was delicious.We absolutely loved our stay here and would do it all over again, I cant think of one thing that was wrong about our time here! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"In the heart of Nanjing Pedestrian Mall This was our first trip to Shanghai and staying at this hotel made it very convenient to everything we wanted to do. You step out the door and you are right on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Mall. The room was very nice - not very big and the bathroom was a bit tired but nice just the same. The bar in the hotel was beautiful - a lovely atmosphere with seluded areas to sit and relax with a glass of champagne as you listen to the groovy background music. The buffet breakfast was ok, but nothing to write home about. We had the added bonus of being Accor Advantage members which got us up to 50% off all food and beverages in the hotel. Service was ok and most staff could speak English. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Best location in town clean and well designed rooms We stayed two nights at this hotel and could not have asked for a better location. It is in the center of the Shanghai shopping district, and we easily walked (15 minutes) to the Bund and Pearl Tower. Beautiful foyer, rooms were well designed but the layout of our room was strange- the TV had to be moved to watch from bed. My luggage got lost on the way there and the concierge called numerous times and updated me throughout the day. My luggage was found and delivered to the hotel within 24 hours thanks to his help (and Japan Airlines- so easy to deal with).The only negative was the lack of a pool, but I would definitely recommend this hotel. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Nice location ... typical Sofitel quality and service Stayed 2 nights. The hotel is centrally located in Shanghai with lots of sights and activities in the vicinity. Did not partake in much as I was on business. The shops/restaurants were closed by 10 which I did not expect.The room I stayed in was small which was not unexpected. Clean rooms and fairly modern. No issues with noise or anything like that.The breakfast lounge was typical breakfast fare and service was fine. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Right on Nanjing St near the Bund We enjoy this small and elegant hotel every time we visit (this was our 3rd visit). Great staff, nice rooms, right on Nanjing shopping street. Only negative is the street vendors that accost you as soon as you leave the front door; but you can just go out the side door and miss them all. An easy walk to the Bund, outstanding breakfast buffet, attentive staff. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Wonderful location This was our second stay at the Sofitel Hyland. Our first visit we had a room on the 20th floor which had wonderful views, on this occasion we were on the 15th floor and the room had a damp smell when you entered. We were only staying for 2 nights &amp; we were hardly ever in the room but had we been staying longer I would have asked to change rooms.The location can't be better; right on Nanjing Rd, the reception staff were very professional and check-in/check-out was very quick. the flower arrangements in the lobby are amazing and the candles make it a very relaxing place especially in the evening. We didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment on the food but we always enjoyed a drink in the bar in the evenings where service was faultless.I would stay at the Sofitel again but would request the room on our first visit. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Badly in need of a renovation Nice lobby, but rooms are badly in need of work. Bed is rock-hard. Combo shower/tub "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Stay booked a club room via hotel website - only because that was the only room available!! However we were glad we did in the end, the club benefits were excellent. Private check-in on 30th floor. Our room was on 25th floor &amp; we had the best view!! view of oriental pearl &amp; river from our room window!! hotel is well located short-walk to bund, markets &amp; corner store.club breakfast on 30th floor was terrific, selection of food was great &amp; quality was top notch. staff were very attentive.We made sure we made the free 6pm-8pm club drinks &amp; this was superb, a selection of premium beers, wine, scotch &amp; even cognac was avaiable as well as excellent finger food. Room was very good.Hotel highly recommended - spend the money for club benefits "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Room is great but the service is not I believe Sofitel is a 5 star property but the service is really not there. F &amp; B- food in the chinese restaurant &quot;Mao&quot; is expensive and the taste is average.- breakfast at the cafe is the same daily. Got tired of the food after 1 week. Quality and taste is good though. - service staff are slow and inefficient although the cafe is not crowded. They stand around talking instead of clearing plates and topping up coffee or tea. I have to ask for top up everyday. I did see a Caucasian lady who moves very fast to do clearing and service the guests but not the local staff. - I asked for a fresh hot waffle and they asked if they could heat up the cold one that has been laying there.- we had a la carte orders at the cafe one night and the food taste terrible. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff eg. to get a glass of water. The restaurant was very quiet with just a few guests but they are nowhere to be seen. I did see 3-4 of them standing at the cashier counter and entrance but is it necessary?- 1 order of sandwich through room service took 45 minutes although the staff said 25 minutes. No follow up call to say that it would be delayed.Housekeeping- took away our drinking water and did not replenish. We have to ask for it.- did not replenish the bath gel but fortunately I brought my own- nice fruit platter given on the first day but staff did not bother to clear or change the rotten fruit after that. I do not expect to be given a fruit plate daily but could at least remove the rotten fruit or remove the whole plate. - floor is not clean. Our feet turn &quot;black&quot; when we walk bare footed in the room- toilet seat cover was broken for the whole week I was there but never repaired. I assume they did not clean it for the whole week because they would have discovered that it is broken. Security- saw lots of them around the hotel which is good but never smiling. Maybe they are supposed to be more &quot;serious&quot;.Room- the room is nice and cozy with extremely comfortable beds and pillows. Even the extra bed which I slept on is great. - the lock and the handle on the sliding door at the toilet is quite difficult to handle. I was fiddling with it for 5 minutes before I could get out. - same goes to the wardrobe door. Not practical. - sufficient storage space for luggage and clothes- many tv channels to choose fromFront Desk- staff who did the check in for us were very friendly and efficientLocation is fantastic. Lots of shopping malls, shops and restaurants nearby. I would love to return to Shanghai in the future but would choose to stay in another hotel. There are many choices to choose from. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Overpriced First night in Shanghai and China. Was very impressed with the lobby. The restaurant was nice, but the location was very close to a lot of others. Found the rooms small and the cigarette smoke is very noticeable. Staff slightly aloof. Stay was nice, but on our last night stayed at the Riverside Bund and that was super. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Wonderful Staff Excellent Location Best in Shanghai I chose this hotel based on fellow reviewers' experiences and finding out more from the hotel website, where we did our booking too.It certainly gave us one of best hotel experience; here are the reasons:1.Excellent location, right into the Nanjing Pedestrian Walk (East) which close to Nanjing Rd East EXIT 1 from Metro Subway, around 5 minute walk (to right side from Hotel 1st floor)2. Surrounded by Fast Food Rest. and Department Store &amp; Various Stores which opens until 10pm3. Wonderful Staff; from their nice Security Staff (from every entrance), helpful concierge staff, friendly reception staff and efficient Housekeeping staff. For those taking Maglev train from Airport &amp; Subway to Nanjing Rd East ( 20-30 minutes trip compares to taxi of 1.5 hours), please take Exit No. 1, then turn to your Right side, walk along the road, the Hotel will be on opposite side, looked for Haagen Daaz Ice Cream Restaurant which is next to the Hotel Sofitel- Nanjing Street entrance. We filled in the online feedback and suggested more Signage to be put up around the Subway, we didn't see any prominent signage and added with difficulty of local people who seemed not too aware about name of the Hotel, the Hotel took our suggestion seriously so hopefully fellow traveller will find the hotel easier in the future. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Beautiful Hotel The Sofitel Hyland Shanghai was a great place to end our 12 day visit to China. The lobby is beautiful and the staff was efficient. The concierge was very helpful when were needed to go to addresses that were not very familiar. We got to both locations easily with his written Chinese addresses. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was wonderful. The croissants were fabulous.Our room was well appointed and had everything we needed including chocolate at bedtime. We had a view of the city. The hotel is located right on Nanjing Road and is very convenient to everything. It's walking diatance to the Bund. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good hotel with busy central location This is a good hotel, although not quite in the same class as the Sofitel in Xi'an. I think the only thing I really did not like was that the hotel opens right onto Nanjing Road which is always heaving and you get mobbed by hawkers selling $10 Rolexes and $15 Versace handbags whenever you step out - still many will like this central location.We had a Club room on a high floor with a great view over the Pudong and the Club facilities were really good (again not as great as Xi'an). Our room was large and clean with a lovely bathroom.We ate once in the restaurant on the ground floor which was a good/average buffet although they do also have a la carte. We ate one night at a bar called Five on the Bund (about 10 minutes walk), which was good fun. We also got in a cab one evening and went to the Ruijin Hotel complex in the French Concession which has lots of bars and restaurants - we had a few drinks in Face Bar and a curry in Huzara - all great. Another interesting place for dinner would be the Zintiandi area - we had a nice lunch in KABB. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Excellent hotel in Excellent Location This Hotel is superb. We stayed for 3 nights and we were not disappointed. We stayed in a Club Room and I have to say it was well worth the extra cash. Club Rooms have their own Check in on the 30th Floor. This is also where you have breakfast and this was the best breakfast we had during our trip to China. The breads etc are beautiful. As Club Room residents, you also get free internet on the 30th floor and between 6pm and 8pm each night there are free drinks and canapés which was a nice touch.The Hotel is on the main shopping street and close to the Bund. Infact it’s a great location for everything. We found it much easier to walk everywhere than get taxis. You just spend half your time in traffic if you taxi everywhere.I would truly recommend this hotel to anyone. Staff are attentive, food is good, décor is clean and modern and service is just second to none. Loved it!! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Lovely Sofitel Hyland Shanghai I recently returned from a five night stay at the Sofitel Hyland in Shanghai. A very nice hotel in the heart of the shopping district on East Nanjing Road. The staff was always polite, courteous and always willing to help. The room was rather small but very adequate. The breakfast buffet was plentiful with a nice choice in both Chinese and Western fare. And because the hotel is French owned and run, the baguettes and desserts were wonderful. I also enjoyed the dinner buffet featuring Asian and Western food. However, one can also order a la carte or dine in other restaurants in the hotel. The location of the hotel is in walking distance to the Bund, Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Grand Theater and the Urban Planning Museum. All in all, I would surely stay at the Sofitel Hyland again. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good Business Hotel Sofitel Hyland is right in the middle of the Nanjing Road shopping area. This is a high end hotel with all the western conveniences and good service. Everyone speaks English and is willing to help with taxi, airport arrangements and in-town dinners. I stay on business and have not tried to arrange any tourist stuff thru them. Meals are good, but not great. The 7th floor is a spa with a small workout room. Most of the spa business appears to be massages and grooming. Room rates are expensive, even for Shanghai, but no hassles or problems for western travelers. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Loved the Sofitel I loved the Sofitel Hyland! The location of the hotel can not be beat. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean- I would definitely recommend staying here when you visit Shanghai. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Sofitel Hyland - great location Stayed at the Sofitel Hyland for a two week business trip in Shanghai. I was expecting some fairly good things of this &quot;luxury&quot; french branded hotel, and I have to say that it didn't necessarily live up to my expectations.We were met at the airport by the hotel car, a service which is excellent for a first time visitor (although marginally overpriced) and much more comfortable than spending an hour in the ubiquitous VW Santana taxi and FAR less nerve-wracking.On first arrival at the hotel just before midnight, check in was very quick, the bellboys taking our cases off us and delivering them a moment or two after walking into my room. First impression of my room on the 18th floor was &quot;is that it?&quot;. It was certainly clean and tidy, though mildly shabby in places, just unexciting. The bed was comfortable without being exceptional, the bathroom pleasant but not luxurious and the view that I had was of the high rise under construction opposite.Breakfast the next morning (and for the next two weeks) was perfectly okay, with a wide range of choices, hot and cold, healthy and not so healthy, local and Western. The main gripes were that the tea and coffee were frequently served lukewarm, and the service often rather patchy.The bellboys were very helpful every morning in helping get a taxi, and making sure the driver knew where to take us. The concierge also helping out by writing down addresses in chinese. The main plus point of this hotel though, is it's location. It's been remarked by other reviewers that many places are within walking distance, the Bund, the Jin Mao tower (WELL worth a visit and either a drink in the bar or a meal in the restaurant) and the main Nanjing Road shopping area itself. Some may find the hawkers (selling everything from fake Rolexes to Gucci handbags, as well as &quot;personal services&quot;) a pain, but most are easily brushed off with a simple &quot;No thanks&quot;. Some of the beggars are a little more persistent though.I was quite ready to leave after two weeks, but that was no fault of the hotel. The service received was mostly efficient and mostly friendly. The facilities were mostly good, and the food was mostly decent. All in all, it was nearly a good experience, just falling a little short in several ways. Would I go back? Probably, though would be tempted to explore some of the other options in the area first. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"loved the sofitel hyland ! We stayed here in November 07 and it was an amazing hotel. The concierges and check in staff are very nice and speak very good english. It is in one of the best possible locations in Shanghai, Nanjing Road. The rooms are small, yet clean, but still nice. It`s also within minutes from the bund, and the Nanjing road metro station. The breakfast was amazing here, and i cannot wait to return. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Central Location We liked this hotel because of its location to much of Shanghai's city attractions. We could walk to the Bund, Renmin Park, Pudong, etc. The room was more than adequate. Staff very helpful regarding places to visit, suggested destinations, etc. and English was spoken and understood well Front Desk and Concierge staff. With so much dining choices in Shanghai, no need to eat in at the hotel. Breakfast buffet was great. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"A Great Location A comfortable European style hotel. I appreciated this place even more having been in Kunshan for the prevous 6 days. The room was small, clean and comfortable. The bedding was very comfortable. The lounge area was nice and I ate lightly and sampled some of the beers from the on-site brewery (A real treat). Service was good. I had to depart early (before 06:00) the next morning. I made taxi arrangements with hotel and ordered a room service breakfast for 05:30. The food was delivared on time and was delicious.The hotel fronts on a busy shopping area that is full of restaurants and night life.I definitely would stay here again when I have the opportunity. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Still a great hotel very nice club lounge A little more than a year after my last stay, I returned on business. I really like this hotel. It is very nicely decorated. I used the gym, it was adequate, and the spa, the massage was nice. I stayed in a club room which gave me access to the top floor lounge. It was very nice with a great view. The breakfast up there was very good (better than in the Horizon lounge at the China World Shangri-La in Beijing). "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great location but small rooms This hotel has one of the best locations of any hotel in Shanghai. Its right on the Nanjing pedestrian Street with countless shops and a great atmoshere at your doorstep. However, other than the hotels restaurants, you wont find much in the way of dining besides fast food close to the hotel.Our room was a little on the small side, with a combined bath/shower. However the bed was confortable and the amendities in the room were sufficient. We booked on the accor.com website and managed to get the hotel for under AUD$100 a night incl tax.Overall a great hotel and I would stay there again, just probably get an upgrade to a bigger room. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Location location location Stayed here as part of a tour around China in October 2006 for 3 nights.Room was comfortable and clean, pretty standard and a good size which is what you would expect for an international chain of this standard. What really sets this hotel apart is it's location and the breakfast!First off the breakfast is really rather good, with a good selection of pastries, breads, juices, plus chinese and western breakfast staples (the egg chef makes a really mean omlette too) to get a good start on the day. Waiting staff were typically attentive and efficient refreshing my coffee cup almost every time I turned my back!But the main selling point of this hotel is the location. If you want to be right in the heart of the action then this is the place, you are right on the Nanjing road 10 minutes walk to the Bund, there is so much life here I spent 20 minutes one morning just watching some people taking part in a dance class in the square below. For those pining for the tastes of the West there is a KFC and a McDonalds yards from the hotel (ideal for a late night snack if you don't want to pay room service prices).There may be better hotels in Shanghai in terms of comfort and luxury, but there are few that can beat the Sofitel for location and quality of staff service "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Location!!! As mentioned by previous reviews, this hotel is an a great location which is right on pedestrian street of Nanjing Rd. I had high expectations on the rooms based from the pictures on the website but the standard room is not one of them. But, it wasn't that bad and the facilities are clean. My only complaint was with the connecting room I booked for my children wherein the aircon controls where not working.The concierge was helpful in getting a taxi for us on our way back to the airport by making sure the drivers (we got 2 taxis) understood which airport we are going to since almost all cab drivers we have encountered does not understand English. With this, make sure you have the hotels/other sites address in Chinese or else you'll have a difficult time telling driver where you're headed. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Not so great if you are in a Superior Room The superior room was not that great . Yes, I know that it is the most basic room but there are still standards that apply. The carpet was very stained and the air-con was out of control. Thank goodness it was the middle of winter or we may have evaporated into a mist. Also, in the bath they had this horrible rubber mat stuck in the bathtub - made my toes curl. The website is clever and you have to be eagle-eyed to realise that the free broadband and seperate bath/shower applies to the Club Sofitel rooms and not the superior room.....I'm sure they don't mean to be misleading (sic). Paying for broadband in your room is so old school these days (120 RMB for 24 hours) but we could access the internet for free in the hotel lobby. Concierge were helpful and housekeeping kept our room neat and tidy. And, yes...the beds are VERY Comfortable. I'm sure that the great reviews about the Sofitel are from those that have stayed in the Club Sofitel rooms. Finally. Yes, the Sofitel Hyland is a great location if you are going to hang out at The Bund all day but it was winter and freezing so we found ourselves walking towards Old Town/French Concession each day where most of the cool restaurants and funky shops seem to be. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great location This is an older property and the rooms reflect this. Room size is not large, even a bit cramped. Bathroom is OK but clean.But the location is hard to beat. It's right on Nanjing Road, in the middle of the busiest shopping sections where it's pedestrian only. It's not far away from the Bund (15 mins walking). "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Nice and quiet in bustling area of Shanghai I arrived onsite to make the booking (it was late at night). It was for a business trip, and I had to stay in a single suite due to the availability). For the price, the stay was alright. It cost me 3000+ RMB/night for 2 nights. Its breakfast was great! Though I would have to say that the lobby does not justify the comfort of the rooms. Check in was fine. The people were nice and professional.Conclusion:The stay was alright given the price. Won't exactly call it worth the value. I believe the Westin Bund Center or the Royal Le Meridien would be better with the price range (in terms of the hotel rooms, that is). But the place is quiet. Good for travellers wanting a good rest. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"On Pedestrian Street The Sofitel in Shanghai has a great location. It is right in the middle of Nanjing Road, the pedestrian street. The facilities are excellent although personnel at the front desk were either totally new or not very competent. It took forever to check-in, forever to change money, forever to ask for anything. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Modern and comfortable Stayed one night in a suite. One of the most comfortable hotel beds every encountered. Both the living room and bedroom had large LCD screen TVs. As mentioned by many reviewers, the location is a big plus point as it is a short distance (10 min walk) to the Bund and right in the middle of the famous Nanjing Road pedestrian mall. Only complaint is the internet charge of RM120/day. By Chinese hotel standards, this is an outrageous price. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Highly recommend the Sofitel Hyland My wife and I have just returned from 5 nights at the Sofitel Hyland. It is a very comfortable hotel in a fantastic location with immediate access to Nanjing Road. it is within walking distance to the Metro, the Bund and to Peoples Square. The rooms were very comfortable (the bathroom was small ... but so what) and the beds were great - firm. Breakfast was excellent. The staff were helpful. A very comfortable 3 - 4 star hotel in a great location. I highly recommend it. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Loved the Sofitel Hyland Shanghai We stayed for a week at the Sofitel Hyland Shanghai. We booked it through the Accor web, where they said they guaranteed the lowest price ( and it was true!). We paid about 60 Euros plus tax and it was a really nice experience.- Hotel Lobby is renewed: very modern, very nice.- Staff is very attentive and they speak English ( not so frequent in China, so you will love this!)- the whole hotel is very clean and well decorated- rooms were large and very modern. Beds were GREAT! Sofitel has something related to their bed experience and it is really good. Our room was quite silent, even when it was just in front of a square with lots of people since very early in the morning.- the sight through our window was un believable: just in front of a square, so many lights on every building... great. - our bathroom was not one of the renewed, but was quite new, even though. Very comfortable, all in white. Nice.- Internet access was good.- the hotel has several restaurants, good level and good food.And LOCATION: is is just in the middle of everything. Excellent location. One of the entrances faces a walking street were Mardi Grass is held during February.In a few words, I could not believe we got such a good hotel for such a low price! I expected much less, I should say.You will be offered an upgrade to a renewed room, with breakfast included, just per 20 Euros more. It is a good option, bathrooms are absolutely new and room has a different decoration, more minimalist and modern. We did not take this option.If you have to stay in Shanghai, I definitely suggest you take this option (unless you plan to work in the business district, which is a little far from this hotel). "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Location I've stayed in this hotel three times and always booked Club Sofitel rooms, which have been superb. The Club lounge offers great views of the city and a decent breakfast.The location is excellent for the main sights (Nanjing Road, Peoples Square and The Bund), but the downside is the hawkers harrassing you as soon as you walk out of the door, trying to sell you watches, handbags or a &quot;lady massage&quot;.There's a metro station nearby and it's much easier and cheaper to use the Maglev train and metro to reach the hotel from the airport than using a taxi; car journeys in Shanghai are pretty terrifying until you get used to the chaotic driving - I've only seen one accident in four business trips.Just be wary of friendly locals wanting to practice their English and then offering to take you for a drink or to view a tea ceremony - they're both scams to rip you off e.g. 1000RMB for the tea ceremony or huge bar bills for vastly overpriced drinks - you have been warned! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"great hotel! did spent 3 nites at the end of sept,great hotel and location. after reading bad reviews regarding this hotel,i decided to go anyway,i upgraded my room to the &quot;sofitel club&quot; which is the top floor with their own lobby ,front desk,and complimentary breakfast and computer access for $120 a nite!! this hotel is fews minutes from the bund and pudong.i do work for 5 stars hotel resort around the world and this hotel was GREAT! the staffs spoke very well english and they were very helpful with all my needs. this hotel is great for leisure or business.enjoy your trip : ) "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"A mixed bag ! Four of us spent 5 nights at the Sofitel Hyland late August 2007. We were a family group consisting of my Mother, Daughter, Sister and myself. The booking was for 2 superior rooms with twin beds. We chose this hotel for a number of reasons, most importantly two points, location (slap bang on Nanging Rd ) and the room description on the official web site, stating separate shower. This was to make showering easier for my 70 year old Mother. Not so simple to climb into a bath to shower! We also liked the picture on the net of a superior room. On arrival at the hotel we were given rooms on the 16th floor. Avoid rooms 1622 and 1601. They are NOT renovated and very small with worn furniture. The view is of a construction site, the rooms being on the back side of the Hotel. The bathroom was quite a shock. Shower over the bath!!! Very small. Exiting the bath had to be done at the far end or you would step out into the toilet! The air conditioning in room 1601 was barely working. On raising concerns with reception we were told the hotel was very full and moving us would be very difficult. No explanation wes given for the difference in the room to the picture shown on the web site. An offer was made to send a repair man up to fix the aircon. The temperatures in Shanghai at that time were 32 to 36 degrees C. After some tinkering the aircon improved enough to keep the room reasonable as long as a door card was left in the power slot 24/7. We have sent an e-mail to the Hotel Manager relating our disappointment and concerns. At some point in the future I will report back on the reply.On the positive side breakfasts were superb in variety and quality. Wonderful value for money and set us up for the day.Location is also fantastic being on Nanging Rd and between two Metro stations. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good value! Good location, rooms have the tipical Sofitel Standard, breakfast and service are also good. All is at very good 4-star level. Yes it is not 5-star, but very good 4-star quality (and better as many so called 5-star hotels). And in addition, it is a good deal, compared to other hotels in Shanghai that are much more expensive, but not on a higher standard. You know what you get at a Sofitel! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Location PLUS! Spent 26, 27, 28 July 2007 at Sofitel Hyland on the Club floor which was definitely the way to go at a time when China was SO HOT! Days around high 30s degrees C, and nights not much better! I wouldn't recommend this time of year to travel in China though if you are looking to attend the Olympics (August 2008) I would go to Shanghai after Beijing when it might be a few degrees cooler and when sightseeing is not such an uncomfortably hot chore. Sofitel Hyland is very well located within walking distance (even with heavy backpacks) of metro. We had great views to the Pearl Tower. (if you could peer through the air pollution!) The airconditioning worked well, thankfully! Shanghai isn't cheap, but I would recommend you pay the extra and stay on their Club level; it's worth it, especially if you aren't travelling with your own laptop, as you have free access to internet (3 computers) and their &quot;happy hour&quot; showers you with nibbles aplenty. I travelled with my 18y.o. son who is studying this year at Nanjing Uni., so he had great chats with the local staff and enjoyed his days of luxury beyond his university dorm! There's an Aussie Manager (Anthony, ex Adelaide guy) on staff who is such a wag: he's terrific and his wealth of hotel experience from home, Hong Kong, and other Asian cities within the ACCOR group probably gives the hotel a bit of an edge in terms of service, though we didn't hear too many other Australian accents while we were there. This Sofitel is right at the head of Nanjing Lu, the pedestrian walk,and nearby a ridiculous number of shops selling &quot;pearl&quot; jewellery. Easy to get a taxi to and from, and plenty of buffet breakfast choice with a wide range of appealing cereals and fruits which are a blessing if one is not into cooked breakfasts! Unfortunately, no swimming pool which in high summer was something we missed, but we were too busy sightseeing to use it much anyway. Corporates will however enjoy the currently-being constructed outdoor entertaining area on the 7th floor where Anthony is overseeing huge improvements which will mean balmy nights can be spent in a brilliantly landscaped area capable of holding over 300 people. All in all, a well located and presented hotel. But do yourself a favour and buy (from the Foreign Bookstore in Fuzhou St, near Waygong Hotel) an up-to-date and easy to decipher street map. The one from Sofitel is dreadful. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Right On Nanjing Rd - Great Location! I just spent an amazing week in Shanghai and I stayed at The Sofitel Hyland for the whole duration.Location is perfect as it is right on Nanjing Road which is like the 'Las Vegas Strip' of Shanghai. Full of life and energy and the road just looks amazing at night.The room was smaller than I expected. The view was incredible, it was a great feeling waking up and seeing the Pearl Tower. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The only thing was that the sheets were not tucked in properly, so presentation was messy. I was suprised as the sheets were not changed at all. I stayed for a week and it should be standard for them to clean it, twice at least. I noticed this because I accidently spilt something on the sheets and they didn't even change it?Bathroom was good and had all the ammenties. The shower head was tricky to turn on. Just remember to pull the nozzle out from the tap for the shower to work.The restaurant was nice and the breakfast is definitly worth getting. Didn't get sick from the restaurant food! yay. Staff on some occassions weren't that attentive. Had to ask for a pot of coffee 3 times before he brought it out. There was a big buffett selection. They really should have labelling or nametag next to the foods. Didn't know what some of the chinese dishes were. The Business Centre charges 3RMB a minute! Extortion! But I had no choice as I needed to check my flights just before I was checking out. There was an internet place that my friend did find and he said that it was 10RMB an hour on Nanjing Rd. But some advice that he suggested was that you have to show your passport as they scan it and they record what websites that you use on the net. It's a goverment thing. I requested for a late check-out and that gave me till 2pm which was perfect. I was able to do some last minute shopping around Nanjing Rd and then head to the airport in the afternoon.Just keep in mind that it is really difficult to get a taxi and that wasn't just Nanjing Rd, it was all over Shanghai. Try and get the staff in the lobby on Level 2 to run down and grab one for you.This is the hotel to be at, if you want to be in the middle of all the action! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Simply Superior Sofitel My husband &amp; I spent 10 nights at the Sofitel in July. I must admit to being slightly concerned after reading so many negative reviews about it on this forum. We could not fault this Hotel in anyway what so ever, in fact I think I tried hard to find a fault with it, but to no avail. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were amazing. The staff at reception were very helpful and we ceratinly could not complain about their lack of English, in fact it was very good, and of course MUCH better than our Chinese, and we were the visitors in THEIR country. Our room was a little on the small side but nothing to worry about. It was very clean, everything worked and there were no bad smells as reported by previous travellers. Even the cleaning ladies were lovely. Breakfast was a real treat, being able to look out over Nanjing Rd, watching the Tai Chi, exercises, dancing and the locals just going about their normal everyday life. The food was excellent, a huge variety, everything one could possibly want and more. Lastly, the one thing that everyone seems to agree on, the location just cannot be beaten. You are right in the middle of Shanghai's main pedestrian street. It is an experience just to sit and people watch, especially the little trains that run up and down carrying weary tourists.We would highly recommend the Sofitel Hyland to anyone and will most certainly stay there again. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Drippy noise We were on a tour and had no trouble acquiring non-smoking rooms in our hotels, however, after leaving the group and coming to this hotel there were no nonsmoking rooms available - they would cost extra, and the window leaked when it rained. The hotel also charged us for included breakfasts and it took one hour to rectify the bill through our tour guide. Will not go back to China again. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good Location - a bit pricey This was my second stay at this Sofitel. In 2006 the lobby was being renovated and this year it was all new and shiny :-) I have to say the location of this hotel is great for walking, shopping etc. however its not great for taxis as it took about 10 minutes during busy times just to get out on to the main road. Room was nice and pleasant but nothing to write home about for club rates. Breakfast in the club lounge was tasty and the view was great. I agree with the other reviewer, the staff never told us about the additional items that could be ordered :-( A colleague stayed there with me and she had terrible problems with the temperature in her room. Mine was fine. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Sofitel Hyland is fantastic This is one of my favourite hotels in the World. Location is fantastic. The bar area on the second floor has just been refurbished and it is great. The rooms are modern and the facilities first class. I cannot understand how some people said it was disappointing. I suppose some are just hard to please.The club floor and restaurant offers a great place to work or unwind. The club breakfast is very good offering something for everyone. But the location is what sets this Hotel apart. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Disappointing We chose this hotel because of its location and we thought the rates thru the hotel website were reasonable for club facilities (free broadband in rooms).However, we were very disappointed with the club room we got as it was small and toilet was TINY! The toilet flush was extremely frustrating as it took a few flushes to clear and there is a minute waiting between each flush!!! The toilet sink plumbing was also bad.At the Lounge was even more disappointing as they only served 2 types of mini canapes 6pm onwards. Breakfast was average for some silly reason the Club staff does not inform guests that there is additional menu to their displayed breakfast buffet. We only found out when we overheard regular guests asking.Overall Shanghai is an interesting city for food lovers but the lack of taxi ques really spoiled our trip. On our last night it was raining and after shopping we literally had to fight for a taxi. Basically most tourists basically become as rude as the locals in order to survive is my conclusion on Shanghai:-( Definitely would not return to this hotel. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Nice! Breathtaking view! Stayed for 3 nites as part of a China tour. Nice facility, smallish room but adequate. Billed as being on the best shopping street in China, which could be right, but it wasn't the sort of shopping experience I was looking for in China-very western.The room we were assigned overlooked the river, Bund, and the huge TV tower, and the view was breathtaking, especially at nite. The skyscrapers were lit up like a huge Las Vegas!Room did not have an iron nor ironing board and the hairdryer blew hot air for about 3 minutes and then only cold. Had some laundry done and the prices were not as costly as in other facilities. Breakfast was lavish, with a wide variety of food and some French specialities. Staff was pleasant, bed comfortable.All in all, I would recommend this property. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Loved our stay at the Sofitel We spent 6 nights in April at the Sofitel. The location was superb -- right on the pedestrian mall and within walking distance to the Bund, various department stores, and Renmin Square. We were always within 10-15 minutes by taxi to anywhere we wanted to visit in Shanghai. The concierge/bell boys were always helpful in making sure our destinations were written in Chinese. The taxi card and maps handed out by the Soiftel were very helpful. We even used the subway to go the Shanghai Circus station to see the Chinese acrobats and the French concession.We upgraded to Club Sofitel, and it was well worth the extra money. We got a one bedroom suite: one bedroom, spacious bathroom, and a living room where we had a rollaway bed for our daughter. We checked in on the 30th floor; used the internet there and in our room for free; had cocktails/appetizers, breakfast there, although we chose to have breakfast on the 2nd floor for the wide variety of breakfast selections and the opportunity to see the tai chi and dances on Nanjing Road.We ate at two noodle shops adjacent to the Sofitel as well as a noddle place across the way. They had English menus so ordering was no problem. We also discovered the underground shopping mall at Renmin Square. A wonderful gesture: our daughter's 18th birthday occurred during our stay. The management sent up a delicious birthday cake. We didn't tell the Sofitel it was our daughter's birthday -- they must have noticed her birthday on her passport.BTW, for a short taxi ride away, we went to Dragonfly (in the French concession -- concierge has the addresses) for a wonderful Chinese massage, very reasonable price. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Five star location two and a half star hotel Great location, close to all the stuff you want to see in Shanghai, many within easy walking distance, but the hotel itself? The room amenities were quite basic (even though they were &quot;very pleased to upgrade our reservation to a suite at no extra charge&quot;) and somewhat aged and out of date. The service from the staff was average, but no better. And seriously, on top of $200 US per night for this, they have the stones to - with a straight face - announce they want 3RMB PER MINUTE for molasses-slow Internet access? Come on, this is the 21st century. From where I sit, a 5-star location and a 2-star hotel still doesn't add up to a good deal when you're paying a 4-star price. Try the Ho-Jo down the street instead. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Location Great Hotel Slightly Expensive... When arriving at 11am our room was ready. Check in lady tried to sellus a better room off the spot, but since I found my standard expensive enough already, I didn't go for it. Lucky I didn't. My standard room was great, huge, with a sofa area and a large bathroom.Due to my membership in &quot;Sofitel Privilège&quot; a got a nice orchid bouquet and some fruit beside a note from the general manager as a welcome present.Breakfast is extremely nice, great buffet and wonderful atmosphere in the restaurant. Perfect to wake up to! Overall I was very happy with Sofitel Hyland, even though there might be cheaper places to stay in Shanghai. But the location and the product makes up for that. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Club Sofitel is worth it We went to Shanghai during the national holidays in Oct 2006 - as you will see from the photos it is teeming with people at this time of the year. The Hotel is located in a very convenient and central part of the city - Nanjing road and walking distance from the famous Bund.We had a Club Sofitel suite which was very good. What we liked about the hotel: the beds were superb, brand new and tasteful bathrooms, prime location, excellent breakfast (complimentary), canapes and drinks in the evening (complimentary), free internet access. Room service was good, and I tried the spa for the massage which was very good but as others have stated probably quite expensive. Went to the gym which was quiet due to the absence of people - this was the only disappointment. For a hotel in this class, it deserves a better gym.Must do: visit the Bund and have drinks in one of the bars on top of the buildings there (I forget the name - 21 on the Bund?), visit the Shanghai museum, go to Xintiandi for drinks/dinner, and of course shopping. The concierge is very helpful and can guide you. Also make sure you pick up a tourist map from the hotel which has an excellent listing of the places to visit and things to do. I found it very useful.Overall - great hotel, but upgrade to Club class for a better experience. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Overpriced but great location for sightseeing but not shopping We were on a China packaged tour and upgraded to this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews. (Paid an extra $150 a night for our 3 nights in Shanghai).Since we are Sofitel members we were upgraded to the concierge level and glad we were since other guests were not happy with their regular rooms. Ours was nice but tiny even by NY hotel comparison. Bedding and mattress was the best in our China tour! Check-in and out and breakfast on the club level on the 30th floor which also has complimentatry alcoholic drinks and some chinese snacks at 6:30pm happy hour.Location is good for the Bund and People Square. Nanjing Road is like a little Times Squares with all the lights and stores but is no longer the ideal place to go shopping in Shanghai either for upmarket or discount items. Also gets very annoying to be approached every 50 feet by folks trying to sell fake watches and bags when walking with my wife or offers for a lady sex massage when walking alone. Would not advise going for either offers since I heard some nightmare stories. Also many obnoxious beggars with kids and toddlers in tow. Whatever you do, don't give them any money!!!Overall happy with our stay but thought it was a bit overpriced and disappointed that Nanjing Road is no longer the hub for shopping. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"A decidedly mixed experience chez Sofitel Stayed four days at the Sofitel as part of an educational tour with MBA students. Had a single room, 11th floor, that hadn't benefited from the renovation process. The carpet was stained, the bathroom fixtures were old and clunky, the closet was so shallow that I couldn't close the door with clothes hanging, the TV never did work, and the clothes I sent through the laundry came back smelling like Hangpu river water. On the up side, if you like the Nanjing Dong Lu experience the location is good. It's an easy walk to the Bund or Peoples' Square. The staff was attentive, and the breakfast buffet had a nice selection. But if location isn't your primary criteria, there are much nicer places at comparable prices (especially the Crowne Plaza Fudan). "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,What a great location I agree with the previous comments that if you stay at this hotel you have everything at your doorstep. Unbeatable! I and my friend stayed in a club Sofitel room and the check in was so smooth and effecient on the 30th floor. The room and bathroom where large and bright. The Sofitel bed concept was great and I had the best bed ever on a trip to China ( my third visit). Beds in Asian hotels can be very hard but these where excellent. The views are great if you stay on the higher floors but be aware that there is construction site on one side of the hotel and that might be disturbing if staying on a low floor.The service in the Club lounge on the 30t floor was very good. The staff was numerous and tried to help you with whatever problem you had- in my case ranging from finding a local telephonenumber to get my jackets from the tailor. Always friendly and polite. You have free drinks between 6pm and 8 pm and then soft drinks and coffee the rest of the time. Breakfast is buffet style but you also get a menu card with a list of various breakfast items to choose from. The view from the lounge is magnificant. My only disappointment was the spa. I had a manicure with a chineese lady that did not do a job that she was trained for. She could speak no English and I just gave up trying to get at least the same treatment for both my hands. The Spa is quite expensive and my friend who loves massages went to one of the numerous places just outside the hotel and got both massage and a facial for the fraction of the price that the hotel charged.But my overall judgement about this hotel is that it is a very good choice for a city stay. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"great base in shanghai Stayed 4 nights at the Sofitel Hyland. Great central location on Nanjing Rd., within walking distance to the Bund, Renming Sq., etc. Subway station's just a short walk away. The room I had was quiet and very comfortable. I found the hotel to be a great value for the price. An ideal base for looking around Shanghai. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Can't beat the Location We found some positives and negatives, which are the same as a number of other reviewers but overall recommend it. We just can't go past the location and you can often get it at a good price it seems. Other pluses were that the room was comfortable for the price --(I agree though that it sounds like the club rooms are much better --we had a basic one on a low floor without much view) -- the staff was friendly (perhaps not always efficient) and the Malaysian/Thai special buffet they put on was good as a change. Some negatives included a half hour check in while they rearranged rooms, a long time to process any payments, which seemed to need three people, a strong smell of varnish in the lobby on several days, a very basic (but clean) bathroom and, like another reviewer , airconditioning that wouldn't turn down, despite them telling us they fixed it. (It was the same for others in our family in their rooms too). That would have often put us off the hotel. But overall as long as you're not expecting a 5 star, to us the location and value for money more than made up for the negatives. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,nice hotel Stay here for three nights. The hotel is located in the middle of NanJing Rd. Easy access to buses and subway.The room was good size and bed was comfortable. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Superb hotel great rooms fantastic location! We settled on the Sofitel Hyland Shanghai after evaluating a number of options for our winter holiday vacation to China. We knew we wanted to be centrally located (it is 15 min walking distance to the Bund, in the HEART of shopping and site seeing, and very close to the subway) and also stay in a luxurious and relaxing hotel. Look no further, the Sofitel Hyland is it!You can get to the hotel from the airport via taxi for about 145 yuan (takes about an hour). This is pretty cheap (in fact taxis overall are very cheap and we recommend them) and it is probably best to arrive via taxi. Going back to the airport, however, you will want to take either a taxi or subway to the famous Maglev high speed train station in the city that gets you to the airport in about 7 minutes. It is a tourist destination of its own and actually even cheaper than a taxi.Most of the action of the city (in fact all of our trip) was West of the river. There are things to do East of the river (e.g., like the big TV tower) but we do not recommend staying over there, you can easily get there and back. There are nice hotels there, the famous one I think is the new Park Hyatt. Anyhow, the Sofitel Hyland is in the absolute center of the city, on the famous Nanjing Shopping Road. We happened to be there on 12/31 and the New Year's celebration occurs at the front door of the hotel -- this gives you an idea of it centrality.We contemplated a lot about whether to spend the extra money on a Club Sofitel level room and decided in the end to go for it -- we are glad we did! While the entire hotel has been renovated, the Club Sofitel rooms are a tad nicer and they offer you access to the lounge which was really really great! In the morning, the lounge offers a nice free breakfast buffet, in addition to a pretty broad menu that you can also order your favorite breakfast foods from (e.g., eggs, pancakes, french toast) -- these are free as well. There are 3 computers with free Internet and you have dedicated front desk staff in the lounge as well. The lounge is relaxing, you can go there any time of day. If you are jet lagged, like we were, having the lounge is great because it is a place to go early in the morning and relax. In the evening the lounge offers free appetizers and cocktails -- both were yummy and we went there every single night pre-dinner, meeting other guests and talking to the staff.The room itself was extremely comfortable. It was new, stylish, a nice size, and had all the amenities we could want (except an iron, although for Club guests you get 1 free pressing). The shower had a neat window that looked into the room (you can close the shades though). Our room was on the 24th floor and had a reasonably good view.We did not eat the hotel restaurant, so no comments there. We did find the staff to be overall very helpful and had a nice mix of locals and Sofitel managers from abroad.You can always step right outside of the hotel and be in the center of it all, even late at night. You can catch a taxi very easily with the help of the hotel staff. Always have your destination written in Mandarin, though, as most people do not speak English, particularly taxi drivers. The hotel has a very helpful card with its name/address in Mandarin in addition to the names/addresses of famous sites nearby.We highly recommend this hotel -- it is a very relaxing place, and fantastic for business or pleasure! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Great Location - Great Hotel My wife and I have stayed at the Sofitel previously (2004) and on our return to Shanghai booked another Accor property (The Panorama) based on price. We lasted three nights at the Panorama before heading back to the Sofitel. Stayed on the Club Sofitel floors where we received an upgrade to small suite. Nice touches like a welcome back note from the Genreal Manager when we returned after a stay in another city. Staff very firendly and helpful. Love Sofitel MyBeds after beds in other Chinese hotels. Breakfast and complimentary drinks in the Sofitel Club Lounge good and also fast and reliable free interent access.We loved the bathroom layout. Location is great and in the future we will not stay anywher else when in Shanghai.Only brickbat regards the air-conditioning which we could not adjust to a cool eniough level even though it was winter. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Great Location We got a good price by going online and booking direct with Sofitel fro their internet special, which was half price of travel agents or Expedia. The hotel is in a great location with the back door of the hotel opening out onto Nanjing road. Only a 10min walk from Peoples Square and Shanghai Musuem. The public areas of the hotel a very nice and represent a good quality 4star hotel. Our room was very small. It had everthing you would expect, i.e. tea/coffee, TV, safe, a/con, etc, but was very small. The bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was not the usual luxury marble affair, but was a simple white tiled room that needed upgrading. I don't think I would stay here again, but would try one of the other hotels just along fromt he Sofitel, maybe The Howard Johnson or if you have a bit more cash Le Meridien. I expected more from the Sofitel, but at least the location was good. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"very good hotel in excellent location Stayed five nights at this hotel and couldn't fault it. We had a large room plus a sitting room on the 18th floor with a good view of theNanjing Rd.Location could not have been better.Very comfortable but not as luxurious as some of the newer hotels which are of course also a lot more expensive.Service was excellent,best in China except for Victoria Cruise ship on the Yangtze. Bell boys and other staff were very helpful and efficent,much better than at the Peace Hotel in Beijing. Both hotels are part of the French Accor Group.Good value for money and they only charged us £27 which included breakfast for an extra bed to be put in our sitting area for my son to stay for one night. Breakfast was first class.If you want to splash out on an expensive meal then go to Jean Georges on the Bund for much cheaper chinese food try the Old Station Restaurant "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Average hotel in a very good location Stayed here for 3 nights and chose it for its central location. The taxi from the airport is CNY150, though we took the maglev train (&amp; a subway journey) on the way back. The hotel is on the pedestrianised Nanjing road, a 10 minute walk from the Bund, and 5 minutes to the subway station.We found the lobby and breakfast area to be clean and modern after its recent renovation, though couldn't help notice a terrible smell throughout. The room was small and rather dated but adequate for our stay. Some of the hotel staff were incredibly rude, entering lifts before we'd even got out for instance. I think this may be more a China thing rather than anything specific with the hotel. Breakfast was fine, if a little crowded if you did not get there early. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Great Hotel in a fantistic location The hotel has been going through some construction for quite a while. We took a chance and were delighted with our stay. This is a great hotel in a prime location on the walking mall. The metro is only blocks away. This location is highly recommended 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,Great location and room I have stayed in 3 different hotels in Shanghai and this was by far the best location and room. The bed was a little hard to my taste but it seems like most hotels in China have hard bed (from my 6 hotel experiences). The room was very clean and the hotel was right on Nanjin road where all the exciting action is. There are alot of restaurants to go to and from the hotel it is a 20min walk to go on the Bund. There are 2 subway lines close to the hotel and one of them is the major People Square station. I definitely recommend this place and will go back again. For 110$US it is a bargain for thelocation and quality.P.S. As for the renovations they are completed and the lobby is very nice. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Please stay here! I don't get the negative reviews of this hotel. From the moment we walked through the door ( no renovations!)we were treated like royalty. The hotel was clean, exceptionally comfortable and the breakfast had to be seen to be believed. Our room was fantastic, no smells, large, clean and with excellent views of Nanjing Road. The location was exceptional, minutes from everywhere! Taxis called by bellboys, nothing was too much trouble! This was by far the friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in throughout the world. Worth going back to Shanghai just to stay there! Our reservations were processed efficiently and by smiling friendly staff! We just loved it!! It made our trip! Every one we spoke to in the hotel loved it and were going home to recommend it to their friends! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Frustration at the Sofitel After a long international flight, we booked a night at the Sofitel Hyland Hotel through a major internet service. When we went to check in at 10pm, the lady at the front desk would not honor the rate that we'd just booked about an hour ago. We had a confirmation number and could still view the receipt online. The best rate she could offer was about US$25 more than the rate we'd booked. She finally suggested that we go find another hotel!!! We were so surprised that a major, supposedly upscale international hotel chain would offer this kind of customer service, and not honor the rate we booked even if it was a mistake. We eventually asked for the manager on duty (a good piece of advice if you have problems in China), who also would not offer us a better rate, but did give us an upgraded room. We finally took it because we were so tired! The next morning, we spoke with the day manager who apologized that the rate wasn't available last night in their computer because of the time difference with their headquarters. She did negotiate with us eventually and gave us back HALF of the money we were owed from the rate we'd booked. :Including our talk with the two hotel staff the night before and the day manager the next morning, we spent about 1.5 hours of our time in Shanghai talking with hotel staff about the problem. They still never owned up to it as their problem, saying it's neither our fault nor theirs.We were in a club room, which looked as if it had just been renovated. The furniture and decor were nice, but the bed was pretty hard (standard for hotels in China). Hotel's location was convenient, right on Nanjing Lu's major shopping area and a few blocks walk from the Bund. Free wi-fi was not included in the room rate, and the hotel's rate was expensive. Make sure to ask before you hook up your computer. Also, the main lobby entrance is being renovated right now, so expect to be rerouted when you check in.Overall, a fairly nice hotel, with very poor customer service standards for an international chain. Make sure to confirm our rate with a phone call if you stay here, and expect Chinese service standards at best. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Excellent stay in the Club Floor I stayed in a suite (#2714) in the Club floor for 1 week. My business partner stayed in a room in the Club floor.Overall, the stay was excellent:The interior of the public areas and of the Club floors rooms is attractive.Location is convenient: 5 minutes walk to Peace Square, 30 minutes walk to Xintiandi, 10 minutes walk to the Bund. The section on Nanjing Road, where the hotel is located, is a crowded pedestrian road. The only problem is the frequent number of people offering foreigners watches, or to go to tea houses (they in fact turn out to be clubs where they try to fix you with escorts and charge you 1,000 RMB for 2 drinks - be careful not to go to these places).The king size bed is really comfortable. The room size is a little small compared to many 5 stars hotels. But is it still comfortable.Service has been excellent during the entire stay. The Club floor staff in particular is excellent, friendly, smiling. It is important to know that the first dry-cleaning service is free (not the first item but the entire bag!) and extremely fast. I thought it was for 1 item only and I only gave them 1 trouser. My business partner gave them his all his clothes in his room. Both of us got our cloths back within 1-2 hours and for free.Breakfast is free in the Club floor. The buffet is very large, the quality very good, the space very pleasant. There is even a more private section.Internet access in the Club lounge is free (2 PCs, and no printer). I paid 140 RMB for 24 hours in the room. It is charged to each specific computer, and not to the room. Internet access to two computers in the same room will be charged twice the fee.The hotel charges 500 RMB for a transfer with a nice car from Pudong airport to the hotel (45 minutes). A regular taxi, requested from the hotel porter, is only 150 RMB. I tried the massage in the 4th floor. It is very expensive (between 400 and 1,000 RMB per massage). I chose a 1:30 hour massage for 8 RMB, I think. At one point, the Chinese massage girl said something to me, which I didn't really understand: I answered &quot;yes&quot; thinking she was asking if I enjoyed the massage. She said that twice. I was in fact being asked if I wanted an additional massage (facial, and feet). At the end of the session, I was charged for 3 massages, 1,800 RMB, which is really expensive. And as a bonus, the following night, the massage attendant woke me up in my bedroom to ask if I wanted new session! I have no doubts the problem comes not from the hotel but from the girl herself. I didn't complain to the hotel because I thought I had been just very naive. But be careful.In 3 years, I have stayed 3 times at this hotel. I have already been very happy with the service in the Club Floor. This year, after tyhe renovation, my stay was even better. I have no plan to change hotel for the moment. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Loved Sofitel Stayed there for 3 nights (executive floors).HK$1090 per night.My comments:Excellent location.The location is like: Times Square in New York, The Strip in Las Vegas, Dundas/Yonge in Toronto, Causeway Bay in Hong Kong. Very clean.Nice service.Most staff can communicate pretty well in English.Newly renovated.Must go for the Sofitel Club (executive floors).Highly recommended to those visiting Shanghai for the first time. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Finally at last they are renovating and refurbishing! This is the second time I've stayed at the Sofitel and my experience this time was immensly better than my last stay in 2003. They are in the midst of renovating the lobby and public areas of the hotel so there is some disruption to these areas. The rooms have been freshed up with new furniture and fittings. Service was impeccable, as to be expected from a Sofitel hotel. Location is fantastic for those keen on shopping as it is located in the heart of Nanjing Road. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"I would not return to the Sofitel Hyland I booked this hotel after positive experiences staying at the Sofitel Xiamen and Sofitel Xi'an. I booked 2 rooms, one for myself and my husband for 2 nights, 1 for my parents-in-law for 4 nights. The reservation itself was problematic - I booked through an internet travel agency and received confirmation but when I contacted the hotel on 2 occasions they reported they had no record of this reservation. To cut a long story short, the names had been sent in an unusual way, with 1st and 2nd names running together, despite this I am surprised they could not have found the names by manually checking a list of guests checking-in on the relevent date. It caused a fair bit of panic, since the rate was pre-payed, I was unable to cancel, the agency were uncontactable by phone in China and the hotel reservation department claimed never to have received a booking from the agency before. The rate was not inexpensive for China but maybe because of these difficulties we were upgraded to renovated club floor rooms and received all benefits (although the staff at first refused to let us in for breakfast in the club lounge). The newly renovated club floor rooms are small, dark and extremely stuffy - the air quality seemed very poor and the air conditioning seemed to make no difference. I live in China and am used to the conditions but have never stayed somewhere where the air quality felt worse inside than outside. The view from our room was quite good - we could see the Pearl Tower. The beds are comfortable and bathrooms small but adequate. It was actually pretty unpleasant to stay in the room at all though because of the atmosphere. There was also a chemical smell in the corridors and 2 of us suffered from headaches during the stay, although obviously I do not know if this was related. There are renovations taking place in the main lobby which means no taxis waiting, but the bellboys were helpful in hailing cabs. The location is central, walking distance to Bund but as in the rest of China, taxis are cheap, easy and honest (carry your hotel card around) and I think staying in the French Quarter or even in Pudong would be fine for tourists - and more relaxing. The hawkers on Nanjing road are persistent when walking on my own I was approached several times by men offering illegal substances. In summary, this hotel is old - very old by Chinese standards - and the renovations may help on the surface but the rooms remain small and ventilation terrible so if you want to feel energised and fresh in the mornings - stay elsewhere. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Good location but... The location of this hotel is great. However while we were there in April 2006, significant renovations were underway. The main lobby was closed, and many of the floors allocated to function/meeting rooms seemed to be under renovation.Luckily we were out of the hotel most days, as construction noise was very loud in my room on the ninth floor.Some mornings conversation at breakfast was not possible due to the noise. Staff working at the breakfast buffet were disinterested in our complaints, and offered very poor service in general.Reception staff on the other hand were very good.The rooms are quite basic and whatever you do, don't use the mini bar. A small bottle of water cost 45 yuan plus a 15% service charge. In the convenience store in the mall, it was 1 yuan! "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,"Super convenient location! I was travelling on a business trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Sofitel Hyland for a second time.This hotel is near our office but I must admit it was a bit pricey even with a corporate rate (RMB1002.80 for a nite includes 15% tax). The hotel needs renovating - the carpets are dark-colored and need to be cleaned, the curtains look dirty. The breakfast buffet was average but it got boring by the 4th day (they were serving the same thing). The air-conditioning worked fine although I recall when I stayed at the hotel in January 2005 the heat was so warm I had to switch it off at night.However, this hotel is located right on Nanjing Road, in the heart of everything. Shopping, work, taxis, train all w/i walking distance of the hotel (even on high heels the walk was fine). I got my clean sheets, clean bathroom, clean towels, etc. I would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay on Nanjing Rd. "
sofitel shanghai hyland ,I would not stay at the Sofitel Again The hotel room that was requested when the reservation was made was not available at the time of check-in. They did say they would allow for an upgrade at a higher price. I was given a second rate room that did not smell very good and was very difficult to control the temperature.They charged extra for High Speed Internet Access which was slower than dial-up.The buffet was not included with the room like at many hotels in China although is was an adequate meal.The one good thing about this hotel is it is right on the plaza within easy walking distance of many attractions. 
sofitel shanghai hyland ,despite bad reviews I loved the place I was a bit put off by the some of the bad reviews regarding the staff small rooms however it was to my relief that non of these concerns were trueThe check in staff were wonderfull and very help full the consiege also very helpful and had a great command of the English language Hotel was in great location very close to shopping and the superb underground The buffet breakfeast was great excellent range of both asian and Western food Reports of renovation noise was unfounded as I never heard any noise Look this is a great hotel in an excellent location and for the price great value indeed

sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Great building terrible service We're regular visitors to Sofitel properties in China and parts of Europe. Typically the staff is very well trained and attentive. This place was a disaster. We were transiting through Shanghai for one night, and our reservation was made by a GM from another Sofitel property. After attempting to check in on the Exec floor we were told we couldn't stay on that floor because the reservation wasn't showing as an Exec floor res. That was the highlight of the stay...The lobby staff (concierge) was dismissive and had no interest in helping us. Honestly, this place was SUCH a disappointment it's hardly worth the time to review it... "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Huge room great service Traveling with an airline friend we obtained a discount rate of $84/nite for 2 nites which seemed a great value for such a nice hotel. Our room seemed very spacious with 2 queen beds with a large center nite stand and 2 smaller ones on the outer sides, a sofa with coffee table, a desk &amp; chair, closet with drawers and hanging space, and a TV on top of a cabinet that housed a mini-bar refrigerator. The bathroom had a large glassed in shower separate from a bathtub that was about 6 ft long by 3 ft high. Free English language newspapers were available daily at the concierge desk. The lower level has a travel ctr where we booked flts to Xian (charged 4% for credit card use so we went to the ATM machine in the lobby and got cash) and a shop that sells cold bottles of Tsingtao beer. The location is across the river from most of the action but taxis are cheap and the metro/subway is even cheaper and faster. The minimum charge cab fare (11 yuan or about $1.60) gets you to the Science and Technology Museum metro station (anyone at the front desk will gladly write the names of places where you want to go in Chinese so you can show the cab driver - and don't forget to take a hotel business card so you can get back) where the escalator down takes you to a huge underground shopping mall - the metro station is down another level. This mall doesn't appear in guide books but is a bargain hunters paradise - watches, jewelery, purses, clothing, pearls, Tiffany knock offs, etc, etc.. The shop keepers, armed with hand held calculators, all seem to speak enough English for bargaining purposes. The standard procedure is is to show you the price of an item and then key in a 20-30% discount and show you the discounted price. If you're not really interested you shake your head NO and walk away. If you're interested you counter with an offer of about 1/4th the original price and then go from there. I got a pair of Ray-Ban style sun glasses for about $8 and a pair of Bose style ear buds also about $8 (the music out of my laptop now sounds pretty good). I left 3 shirts in the dresser drawer and didn't remember them until we arrived in Xian. Using our Costco intl telephone card we called the Sofitel and they had my shirts - gave them to our airline friend who brought them to me. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"nice hotel - terrible room-service!! Just back from a 2 night stay in this hotel and would like to say the rooms are nice - though a little bland. I had a few problems with the air-conditioning (I couldn't make it cold enough) though they weren't bad enough to warrant calling someone up. The lobby is fairly impressive and the staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are also nice and quiet.My biggest problem was with room-service and I may have just been unlucky but I would like to give TA members a few tips. If you order the set-breakfast, be sure to state everything you would like off the list, even if you think it should come anyway ie tea/coffee. My husband ordered the omelette and it was so runny in the middle - again this is a personal thing but to some people that would be inedible. Saves a lot of hassle if you tell them before they cook it. I ordered the Chinese breakfast but because I assumed that certain items would come as standard, seeing as they are on the list ie tea, soy milk etc and didn't tell them, I got ONE item off a list of 5!! To be fair I did tell them and they sent up the missing items promptly. To be honest, it wasn't very good!So in all, the hotel is just ok and in an ok spot but if I were paying for it, I would stay on the other side of the river in town. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Exactly what you are looking for This is the second time I am staying at this hotel and I can't be happier. The rooms are spacious and with amazing views on all sides. The roof top panorama restaurant and bar are rotating, so as you sip on your drink (rather pricey I might add) you might enjoy a 360 view of Shanghai. The Gym and Sauna are well equiped and the staff are really helpful. The location is really convenient. It takes about 30 min by taxi from the airport and about another 15-20 to reach downtown. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,Brilliant - cannot fault it I arrived here after a long hard journey - and was greeted with a very high level of professionalism. The staff were great.The hotel breakfast was perfect - no complaints here.Room was huge and homely - I had a spectacular view of Shanghai from the hotel room.I had a work related incident where I needed the hotel staff's help. And they did not disappoint - I was impressed yet again by how courteous they were.If you're going to Shanghai and have money to splash - give this place a serious consideration. 
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Loved It This was our first time in Shanghai and the Sofitel was the perfect hotel for us. It was comfortable (beds a little firm though) and had great views. The staff were helpful and polite, and the breakfast was excellent with a lot of good choices.This was the quietest hotel we had ever stayed in. In the four nights we were there we were not bothered by noise in the corridor, doors banging, or loud people in the surrounding rooms.We enjoyed our stay very much. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Rooms with great views Have stayed here on three different occasions and generally have been pleased. The rooms have all been different, some with baths overlooking Pudong and some without, but all the rooms had great views. The rooms are spacious with very firm beds and all the usual facilities. My only negative about the rooms is that they could be a little cleaner.When trying to find an electric plug socket it was very obvious that the skirtings had not been cleaned in a while and the carpets could be cleaned a little bit better. However, the bathrooms have all been very clean. Unlike other reviews, I have not had any problems with the room air conditioning or bath plugs.The lobby is very spacious and impressive but feels cold and uninviting. The staff do their job well but are not friendly. The lobby restaurant is ok. The hotel is a long one block walk from the subway and a fifteen minute walk from the Science Museum, under which is another subway station, plenty of shops and a few cafes. There is a Lotus supermarket a block away and a few cafes, convenience stores and massage parlours across the road, but otherwise the area around the hotel is of little interest. I recommend using the subway to get to the other side of the river as the traffic can be horrendous, especially if it rains.Definitely, the hotel's best attribute is its views, particularly from the club lounge floor. Otherwise, I was left feeling that the hotel feels cold and clinical, functional but unfriendly.Nice bedrooms and nice views. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"It was alright..... The Sofitel Jin Jiang was alright..The rooms were nice, spacious, and with a good view. The bathrooms are nice and large. The beds weren`t that comfy. When i went to Shanghai it was about 35c outside, and the air conditioning did not work at all. I called about 5 people to my room but they just kind of looked at me like I was nuts. All the air conditioning does is blow air. It didnt get colder than 24c in my room.The staff werent very helpful. I found them to be more rude than polite. Some barely spoke a word of english, and the concierge didnt either. The only reason I stayed at this hotel was beacuse i went all over Thailand and southern china and i stayed a few nights to connect back home. Plus your looking for something that looks fairly nice and not outragious, but stay at the sofitel hyland if your looking for more of a sofitel experience. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Great hotel with amazing facilities and service. I stayed 2 week ends in a row, due to heavy partying in Shanghai... The hotel is in Pudong about 10 minutes Taxi from the Maglev train station (get the hotel name in Chinese before your trip, so you can show it to the taxi driver). It's also 10 minutes Taxi to Jinmao, and about 15-20 minutes Taxi to the Bund, so the location is ok, even though it's not in the middle of the old or new city. I had an executive room which was fantastic; it was large, well equipped, and clean. The TV could be upgraded to Flat Screen, after all this is a 5 stars hotel. The Bathroom was amazing as well with a view on Pudong from the bathtub. There are also really good amenities, such as a great pool, fitness center and a Spa. Service was really good as well and the food too. Only negative point was the atmosphere, too quiet for young singles, but I guess appropriate for families. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"good amentities but lousy staff having been to this hotel twice this month, I experienced the consistent lousy customer service.Booking: I did it online. Among the selection of the hotels in Shanghai, I chose this hotel over its price not because of the location. They do offer attractive price for club room. Location of the hotel: it is somewhat near to PVG airport. if you take the maglev train and taxi, it will take approxmiately less than an hour to reach the hotel. 10 mins walk from the hotel takes you to Lanchun subway station. There are a few good massage parlour and eateries nearby. staff: during check-in, they never address you by name. never smile! when they speak to their staff on the phone, they speak in Shanghainese and totally ignore your existence. During my stays (twice this month), a late check-out was pre-arranged and approved by the check-in staff. Nevertheless, each time, the check-staff did not pass on the message to the staff on the next shift. As a result, miscommunicaiton happened and I was &quot;told&quot; and &quot; reminded&quot; by the assistant manager each time. No appology was offered .Conclusion: if you are looking for a cheap accommodation, this will be the place. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Sofitel Hell I have had the displeasure of staying the Shanghai (Pudong) property on more than one occasion and I still can't believe I keep going back. This property and the staff in it are a joke. Where do I begin? Maybe with the overly expensive, yet sub standard breakfast that doesn't evolve or change at all. Just the same low quality food at the same time, from the same expressionless staff. The housekeeping/engineering team aren't that much better. Shanghai is one of two temperatures. Hot and cold. And the hotel is the same way. The air conditioning doesn't work at all. Its loud air that blows but it’s not cold nor warm. You call engineering and get nothing but a team of people tapping around and then blankly staring at you. There is no point in calling anyone for help because they don't do a thing. I mean, the bathtub wouldn’t drain. Well after 3 days I finally had to drag someone by the hand to come to the room to deal with the situation. Did they fix the problem, no, they just drained it and informed me not to use it again. The beds in this hotel must be a form of Chinese torture, as they are like sleeping on steel slabs. Of course they look great with white bedding and fluffy pillows. But turn the lights up and the carpet is dirty, and then you realise you are sleeping the next few nights on the equivalent of a barn floor. Now I understand that perhaps the wait staff, housekeeping and engineering may have limited English. But the Bellmen and Concierge shouldn't. They should be pretty close to fluent. And the prices they charge for room service, laundry, etc indicates they are making a healthy profit so if the staff don't speak good English, surely the Sofitel can afford to send them to English lessons with the major markup they are making off of the dumb westeners. Now the reason I have a problem with the bell desk is, myself and two colleagues booked a sightseeing tour of the countryside. Well, it was a day to hell. The concierge happily took our 450 RMB out of our hands. . . but failed to inform us that we would be circling greater Shangahai for 2 hours and 15 mins to collect 6 other tourists!! Then we spent another 2 hours on a bus to get to the destination. Once there we were informed we had to use the allocated public toilet that was absolutely disgusting. This is not what westerners are used too, the toilets were a breeding ground for disease, and the number of people using them surely violated some sort of capacity code! Westererns don't anticipate when they are paying $64 USD for a half day tour that they are going to have to bring their own toilet paper, meals, refreshments on a half day tour! Now of course you can say this is the problem of the tour company, but tell me this. Why didn't the concierge warn us? Tell us to bring water, food, and that it was going to be 4 plus hours til we reached our destination? Huh? When we finally got back in the evening, we went straight to the bell desk/concierge to ask how come they let us go so uninformed on this awful tour, and you know what we got? Blank stares, and no commitment, or responsibility for their actions, and not even an polite acknowledgement that they should perhaps work on their communication skills!!! The Sofitel is simply unacceptable, rude and offensive - AVOID IT if you can!I am intrigued as a leading hotel brand how you are going to register these comments and complaints. I pray you Pudong staff are suffering from a lack of motivational management, and surely this is not your company policy on how to treat guests. . . or is it? "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Some improvements required. I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights on business trip to Shanghai. The hotel is clean, something of a plus in what must be the most polluted city I have visited to date. Room was well appointed and maintenance was in good order. I think the hotel falls down in the &quot;charm and comfort&quot; areas with little in the way of nice areas to break out into or external gardens to stroll round. Food ok, nothing spectacular. Not Sofitel' s best effort and I would probably avoid staying here again. A 3 star hotel. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Fabulous Hotel Stayed here for over a week and was treated like a Princess.Upgraded my room so i was on one of the highest floors in a fantastic suite with free internet access, laundry service and happy hour (which unfortunately I never had time to take advantage of) and breakfast was amazing.Really good hotel, highly recommended.Gym on the small side, but adequate and pool heavenly.Restaurant on the top floor is expensive but it's revolving views make up for it and the food is superb.Hoping to go back on business this year! "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Good stay at the Sofitel I had a good stay at the Sofitel. Here's what I liked and disliked about the hotel - Liked - 1) The overall good service and upfront approach by the staff - indicates good solid training at the Sofitel.2) Got a suite at a bargain rate - 1400RMB through the reception desk to upgrade for a small fixed cost. Always nicer to have a bigger room and that too at a good rate!!3) The very efficient concierge desk - solved our queries, made reservations, every day. 4) The temperature controlled and well maintained indoor swimming pool was a delight to use.5) Central location - A 20 RMB taxi ride away to anywhere.Disliked - 1) A suite by nature should be fully loaded with goodies...probably the barest suite I have ever come across in any hotel - in effect just a bigger room and nothing else. Strange!!2) I'm not in favour of the policy of hotels that offer 150 items for breakfast - in my opinon most people eat the same things - cereal. fruits, breads, some hot dishes and the rest either is thrown away, put into cold storage and served another day or forcibly used to cook other dishes - all unsuitable solutions as far as I'm concerned. You can do a meal with a wide variety but lets conserve resources if we canAll in all a good stay and a hotel I recommend. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,Very good hotel Great hotel. Very modern. Nice restuarants in the hotel but also plenty of options within walking distance of the hotel. Pool and gym great. Rooms were very clean and had a great view particularly from the bathroom. Staff very helpful. I would definitely stay here again. 
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Close to Airport It's good that the hotel is so close to the airport, just 5 mins taxi ride after getting off from the Maglev Train Station.but if u wanna go to the city centre, u've got to walk for 8 mins to the metro station n 15mins ride to NanJing East road!so if u gonna go shopping during the stay, it's not a good choice.The hotel itself is good, i stayed in a room with 2 single beds n i thought ok at the very beginning, but after i saw the room configuration with the one with a King bed, i knew that i was wrong...cos' it's far more bigger than the one i stayed!The check-in staff r nice n helpful (cos' they let me havean early check-in at noon)Swimming pool is clean n tidy, but the shower area ...Overall, i would say that businessman r much suitable to stay in this hotel! "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Although somewhat out of the way a real gem I offered what I thought was a very low bid on a five-star hotel in Shanghai on Priceline.com and was rewarded a room at this Sofitel. I'd stayed in another hotel operated by this French-owned chain and was quite pleased with this development. On checking in, I was offered an upgrade which, for an added Y400 per night included the standard executive package of buffet breakfast (very nice), broadband Internet, one free piece of laundry per day, an open bar happy hour with ample noshes from 6 to 8 each evening, and a very spacious suite on a non-smoking, upper floor with an incredible view of the Pudong skyline. I've stayed in hotels with rooms smaller than this suite's entrance foyer, which even had its own half-bath. Service was superb throughout. The one potential drawback is that the hotel is not in a major business, shopping or tourism district either in Pudong or in Shanghai across the river. Taxis are cheap, but the drivers invariably offer an unpleasantly thrilling race through dense traffic. Curled up in a defensive fetal position in the backseat of a taxi is not the best way to enjoy the scenery. Fortunately, the Lan Cun Road subway station is a block away down the street running perpendicular to the front of the hotel. (Unlike subways elsewhere, Shanghai's system is clean, new, efficient, well air-conditioned and has lots of signs and announcements in English. The ticket machines are even bi-lingual.) Once I became comfortable navigating myself to meetings around town by subway, I was very happy I had booked myself into this hotel for seven nights. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Not the usual ""Sofitel"" service Below average service, with a few funny soundbites and events that get on your nerves:- went down at 9:45 to have breakfast, wearing the hotel slippers, and was told rather abruptly that this was not compatible with the hotel's dress code for breakfast... Went up and down with proper shoes on, was told that shoes were ok now, but no more breakfast service as we were nearing 10:00...- checked out at 7 a.m. and had to carry my own luggage all the way to cashier, across the lobby, to the porch and into a taxi. Not a soul in sight.generally not very friendly service, + hotel location is a bit far from everything. Room OK. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Comfortable bed but not first choice We arrived in Shanghai at the end of a Typhoon and got to the hotel at around 2:00 am. Check in was efficient and we were allocated a twin room as they only had king size rooms that were smoking rooms. We went to have a look at the king size room but is stank of smoke and was very stuffy so we opted for a non smoking twin and the next day we asked for another room and were alloacted a nice corner king size non-smoking room. No free internet access which was a shame. Across China the less fancy hotels and guesthouses all have free broadband so it is a shame that the 5 star hotels really rip everyone offThe complaint about the hotel was bugs - maybe bedbugs or just bugs in the room but I got bitten all over!The bathroom shaver charger and plugs would not take our toothbrush (fisrt time evr) so we had to charge it in the room on the desk.The hotel was nice but lacked a personality and was very inpersonal. The fruit at breakfast could have been better (ripe) but the fresh watermelon juice was fantastic. Across from the hotel is a great coffee shop and restaurant called Tete a Tete. The food was delicious and menus are in english. The concierge (though very friendly) at the hotel did not know anything about the restaurant which is a shame as it was much better value and choice of foof than anything else in the hotel itself.Easy to get a taxi from the hotel and this is the best way to travel in Shanghai. Be prepared for traffic! Also have your wits about you when hailing a taxi on the street, get pushy and beat the locals at their own game.Go to Haagen Daz on the river, near the bus station and big shopping centre with Lotus supermarket (huge supermarket). Not the branch on the street but on the waterfront - you get amazing views of the Bund, especially by night from here.We had a drink in the revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel. It was very nice up there and the service was fantastic - the view was missing due to the weather.We chose the hotel as we were attending a function the hotel and it was convenient but do not think this would be the choice for another visit to Shanghai. Perhaps the Peace hotel will have finished it's rennovations by then... "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Excellent Business We stayed at the Sofitel on business. The hotel is a five star hotel and close to the convention center where we had a trade show. When we were checking in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to the executive level by adding in-room internet service, breakfast and happy hour drinks &amp; food on their executive floor 42. It was an extra $30 per night. We decided to upgrade and we were not disappointed. Our room was modern and spaceous. We had a view of downtown Shanghai. The breakfast was quite good. You could have the buffet, which was quite delicious, or have eggs made to order. In the evening after a day of work, it was nice to relax with a drink and some appetizers. The staff was quite friendly and helpful when it came to recommending sites to see or restaurants. We will definitely stay at the Sofitel again whether on business or pleasure. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Really nice hotel We stayed at this hotel while attending the Special Olympics World Games in Sep/Oct 2007. It was recomended to us by our travel agent because it was close to the Pudong Swimming Pool where our son was competing.The hotel is 46 stories high and we had a very nice room on the 26th floor with amazing views. As mentioned in other reviews it is not in the main centre of Shanghai but most places of interest are only a short distance away by Metro or Taxi, both of which are very cheap. Be warned however, driving in Shanghai is not for the faint hearted and it is best not to sit in the front seat if you don't have to. Century Park and the Shanghai Museum of Science &amp; Technology are only about a 15 or 20 minutes gentle walk away. Lancun Road Metro station on Line 4 is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Metro signs are in English as well as Chinese and the automated ticket machines convert to English at the touch of a button. The Maglev train station is a short Metro journey from Lamcun Road Station although on another line. The hotel staff are all fairly fluent in English and extremely helpful. The consierge in particular was a great help at finding good local restaurants and shops, suggesting places of interest to visit, and arranging tickets for shows etc. The main hotel restaurant and bar is very expensive in local terms but the two private (Chinese) restaurants in the basement are excellent and much more reasonably priced. We didn't visit the revolving rooftop restaurant and bar but understand from other guests that they were very nice. The buffet breakfast has European options but the coffee/tea service was dreadful and our only real complaint about the hotel.Shanghai is an amazing modern city and the Chinese people are very friendly and we would recommend this hotel as a base when visiting the city. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Lovely hotel only slightly let down by location We stayed at the Sofitel for 4 Nights in September after being allocated the hotel by priceline . Having read in previous posts we enquired about upgrading to an executive room on arrival and did so for the bargain price of 230 RMB per night . This entiltled us to a larger high floor room ,which was very clean and comfortable with a stunning view over Shanghai , access to the club lounge for breakfast and evening cocktails and canapes ,free internet access and one peice of laundry per day . This was exceptional value and I would recommend taking the offer.The hotel is located a short 5 minute walk from Lancun Rd Metro station but be warned that the service stops quite early at night (around 10pm) .I would recommend using the metro wherever possible as Shanghai traffic is HORRENDOUS . Our tour guide would not pick us up from the hotel as it would have taken over an hour to get into the centre during rush hour ,for this reason only I have taken one mark away . This is the first time I have stayed at a Sofitel and found that the level of service was above that of its other Hotel chain competitors and I would be happy to stay at the hotel again "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Its not what we expected When we checked in, we were given a superior room on the 12th floor. Carpet was faded and kinda dirty. Room smells like it has not been use for a long time. Requested a transfer to a better room. Due to misunderstanding, we were upgraded to a deluxe room no charge but not until we had a talked with the asst manager. All front desk staff are nice &amp; fluent in English. There are no shopping center or resto or a 7-11 near the hotel so the only option is to dine inside the hotel. The bfast spread was not good. Congee and some preserved veggies only but no dimsum or soybean milk for chinese guest. The fried noodles sucks. The entrees (ham, bacon, sausage, etc) were few and the wait staff was only 3. Not a good deal for a US$138/room/night/bfast/net. Location wise it sucks, F&amp;B needs a lot of improvement. The interiors, so-so, typical but definitely if this is 5 stars then Shangrila Pudong with be 7 or 8 stars, you know what I mean ?? I wished we'd stayed at Four Points Sheraton instead. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Good Place for Business Travelers I was asked by my company to move from the Four Points Sheraton in Shanghai (where I was originally planning to stay) to the Sofitel JJ Oriental in Pudong. I was hoping I hadn't made a big mistake. It turns out that I hadn't.At the airport, my flight was late and my driver had left. I sought out the Sofitel kiosk in the Pudong airport and asked for help getting to the hotel. They were efficient and effective and I was in a car (albiet for a $65 car ride) within minutes. Check in was quick (which was nice since it was late in the evening) and they asked me if I would like to upgrade to one of their Club rooms for the equivalent of about $25 per night. Of course, I said yes. The Club rooms are higher, and come with free internet (usually about $12 per day), happy hour snacks, one piece of laundry or pressing free each day, and free breakfast on the 42nd floor. $25 a day was a deal!The room itself was small and irrgularly shaped, but the view was awesome. I had a whole wall of windows overlooking the Huangpu River and Century Park. I could see the Cirque du Soliel tents being put up for their stay in Shanghai!The bellman brought my bags quickly which was greatly appreciated. Also appreciated were: free robe to use while at the hotel, cookies by my bedside every night, 2 free bottles of water per day, and free shoe polishing. The people at the Sofitel were very nice. My only complaints were the room service menu (not as nice as other 5-stars I've stayed at in Shanghai), the gym is only open from 6am-11pm, and the district where the hotel is located is not a big commercial district, but rather is residential. Not much within walking distance. Other than that, what a great place to stay! "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Helpful staff good location The staff was exceptionally helpful. I had arranged for a car to pick me up at the PuDong airport and they sent 3 people to be sure they would not miss me. The rooms are all new and the general decor is excellent. One can pay more and get more elegance, but I didn't go to Shanghai to sit in my room. I cannot report on the restaurants, but some friends reported that the first-floor place was first-rate.With the club-level rooms, there is access to the 30th floor (free breakfast, cocktail hour and free internet connections with 3 computers available. The location is good: next to the People's park and the mall, but about a 10 min walk from the Bund. Lots of beggars around, but they are not persistent or threatening. Rooms appear to cost about $180/night. I suggest dealing directly with the hotel and not the Accor web-site for the lowest proces. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"good hotel Nice hotel. Room was spacious and clean. Bed was comfortable.Located in the residiential area. 5 -10 min walk to local shops, restraunts and subway station.

sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Great Service- Beautiful Hotel I've stayed in several hotels in Shanghai but this was my first time in PuDong. It definately isn't the best location if you want to sight see but as you know if you have been there Shanghai is a very easy city to get around in with very very cheap taxis. I don't know who wrote the bad reviews of this Hotel but they are TOTALLY unfounded. This is a 5 star hotel with excellent rooms, Service, and facilties. The only think that lacked is the Gym but the Spa is great! This is a great Business hotel and I think it will become my staple when I'm in Shanghai. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Nice and comfortable but probably won't go back My husband and I have stayed at the Sofitel JJ Oriental Pudong 5 times this year. The staff is terrific, the Spring Restaurant downstairs in the basement has good food and it not too expensive. The reason we won't be going back, is because every time we go there, the air conditioning does not work and the room becomes so hot we have to go down to the lobby to cool down. It s like a sauna in the rooms. The other reason is the internet is very unreliable, hit and miss. My husband travels there on business and relies on the internet heavily. Although it has started to feel like our second home due to the great people that work there, the room temperature is unbearable. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Good average 5star The hotel is good avarage 5star, i can´t complain about something.The room was quite big and nice decorated. Everything was working . The lobby and the lobby cafe have great atmosphere.The service worked smoothly.The standart breakfast was complete, i only missed a bit more cheese.The recreation facilities were average. Standart sauna and steam-bath. The rest looked quite nice. They also offer a lot of massages, etc.It´s a good hotel for everybody who needs to stay for some days in Shanghai. Its very close to the New Intl. Expo Centre.The best thing was the great room rate. Only about 130$ a day.Couldn´t find cheaper in that class. "
sofitel shanghai jin jiang oriental pudong ,"Wonderful Experience Prior to leaving for China I read some of the negative reviews but noticed most of them had early dates. It turned out to be a very good choice for my liking, leaving me with the feeling that improvements had been made over time. When you arrive on the property the entrance raises your expectations to something grand as you first walk through the doors; and the lobby was just that. Huge, roomy and sides without walls- all around with additional views from an upper floor. This hotel has a dedicated elevator to the 46 and 47th floors where windows spanning both floors offer quite a view of Pudong. The lovely scattered seating of the 46th floor allow a carefree experience along with the view as one enjoys a favorie drink with friends. The 47th floor is a French Restraunt, but hold on to your wallet. It is pricey. It is much like a private club setting and quite nice. Appetizers and drinks only added just under RMB 1000 to my bill! As stated earlier the lobby is quite an eye catcher. It really sets the mood and expectaions for the stay. Upon checking in I upgraded to the Business Floor so that I could enjoy a private breakfast area, free internet, and comfortable accomodations.For me the bed could have been just a bit softer, but still I will not make an actual complaint as I did find mostly comfort. The layout of the room was nice and the high floor enabled the curtains to remain open so I could wake up to marvelous sunshine, or the wide jaws of a thunderstorm.. as in one day!!While I was there the Spanish Foot ball team arrived to play against China. They had a private party in one of the Chinese restraunts and the staff really worked to give the team a moment without the crowds. The team members were freely avaiable in the exercise rooms however and they seemed to enjoy posing for photos with other guests and staff. Of course, I did not recognize any of them so all I know is that they seemed very personable and smiled a great deal.I arrived the JJ Oriental with a feeling of wonderful excitement and left feeling I could have stayed a bit longer.. Next stop Hong Kong. "

st regis shanghai ,"Top Notch Convenience for Business in Pudong and Beyond The St. Regis Shanghai is very convenient to the Maglev station and PVG airport. This is a great location for doing business in Pudong, but might not be quite as good for sightseeing.The amenities and fixtures are on par with other St. Regis properties, however this hotel does not have an intimate feeling like some others. Definitely caters to business travelers and their needs. All services including checkin/out, breakfast, and the executive lounge happy hour went off without a hitch.Without repeating comments made by other travelers, the only major negative would be the bed. Although I was OK with it, this was by far the firmest bed myself and my colleague staying in another room have every encountered. If you are picky about your mattress you might not get a good night's rest. "
st regis shanghai ,"Very nice; no complaints at all Stayed 4 nights for a business trip. The rooms are cooky cutter, but finished out very nicely and stylishly. The rain shower head was particularly welcomed after 28 hour straight negotiating sessions.They were offering a deal for $25 or so more per night where you had access to the club floor, which included breakfast and free drinks and hor'd vers (sp?) at night. Worked to hard to enjoy this, but if we could have had the free drinks, this definitely would have been easy to justify. The lounge is on the top floor and has an amazing view (smog permitting) and has free internet.The hotel was also very accomodating as far as staying late for our meeting sessions and letting us use this lounge area for meetings almost all-night long. "
st regis shanghai ,"St Regis My first ever St Regis hotel stay and although its not somewhere lush, the hotel didnt disappoint me. "
st regis shanghai ,St. Regis in Shanghai has great service and wonderful rooms The St. Regis in Shanghai has plenty of super helpful staff 24x7. The rooms are exceptional with the best shower I've had in a hotel! The buffet breakfast is good. Conference facilities very good with silently helpful staff on hand the entire time. 
st regis shanghai ,"amazing hotel experience We loved this hotel - great staff, short walk to metro, large rooms and bathroom, and a gorgeous hotel. "
st regis shanghai ,"Not bad for a 4 star but not a real solid 5 star hotel - missing on the soft side I like the hotel for its hardware...really nice looking lobby, nice pool, gym...etc, but something is kind of missing for a true 5 star hotel.I ate a meal in the the chinese restaurant and was charged the snack they brought to me before I ordered my dinner...I thought it was complimentary and no body told me it is not. I also did not seem to get any butler service and as if they don't have any. And the hotel is not that old but is already showing major signs of age...especially the carpet.Overall, not a bad hotel and is better than probably 90%+ hotels in Shanghai. "
st regis shanghai ,"My 'default' pick in Shanghai I've stayed at this hotel many times, for various duration. This is my 'default' pick when traveling to Shanghai on business. It's located in a quiet but convenient area of Pudong. The room's very spacious, with very well-maintained facilities &amp; amenities. the bathroom's just great with a big tub + a shower you can actually feel the water pressure. The hotel staff's very friendly &amp; resourceful despite me being a young female chinese solo traveler who's most likely to receive maltreatment. it's a vry cozy hotel without feeling uptight like in other international brands. i like the fruit basket &amp; their breakfast too! "
st regis shanghai ,"Treated like royalty We stayed in a King Deluxe room for six nights on our trip to Shanghai. The room was nothing short of fabulous and the personal butler service was impeccable. In fact, the entire staff - at the front desk, the door, the restaurant and room service - was amazing. Our suite was very large with a spacious living room, office area and powder room. The bedroom was separated from the living room by large double doors. There was a large flat screen TV in both the living room and the bedroom. The bedroom had a walk in closet fully equipped with a large safe, iron, ironing board and plenty of cupboard and drawer room for your belongings (in addition to the dressers in the bedroom). The en suite bathroom was palatial. Clad in marble, it had a separate toilet area, huge soaker bathtub (with a little TV mounted on the wall) and large walk in shower. We had an expansive view (virtually wall to wall) of the Shanghai city lights from both the living room and bedroom. They even added extra touches like fresh lilies and roses, bottled water and chocolates. High speed internet was included in the rate of course.Although some might not appreciate the fact that this hotel is not in a more central shopping or tourist area, we enjoyed coming back to a quiet, relaxing oasis in the city. The hotel amenities were also amazing - large pool with a view and fully equipped fitness room. The quality of service was amazing. We were jetlagged and decided to give up fighting it so when we'd order coffee or tea in the middle of the night the &quot;personal butlers&quot; would bring them up promptly and insist that they set it out and pour it for you. When a nose piece on my glasses fell off, the front desk immediately located some crazy glue for me! "
st regis shanghai ,"The best service in Shanghai In this trip, I stayed at both the Four Seasons and the St Regis, and have to say the St Regis is without doubt the nicer of the two hotels. The St Regis staff were eager to please, spoke excellent English, and the hotel provided exemplary butler service, with free pressing of 2 articles of clothing, and free coffee and tea in the room. It was a very civilized experience to have some Chinese tea in the morning as I was packing up to leave China. Furthermore, the airconditioning was nice and powerful -- important during a Chinese summer! I stayed at the St Regis because I was in transit from elsewhere in China and needed to overnight in Shanghai before returning to the USA. The St Regis is closer and far quicker to PVG airport than the Four Seasons (the taxi ride from the airport at night cost only 120 RMB - less than $20), and the hotel is only 20 min and 40 RMB from the Maglev to PVG during daytime. The room was great: the rainforest shower, the generous toiletries, and the bath tub and bath salts made it so wonderful to be back in a first-world city after traveling in Tibet. The view toward Puxi was also pretty good from the 32nd floor, though Shanghai is not really one of the more picturesque cities of the world. I did not go for a swim due to lack of time, but the pool looked inviting. I did have a good late-night workout in the gym (which, unlike the pool, is open 24h) after arrival. There used to be a tennis court on the 7th floor, but the fitness center attendant said it had been closed for a while, and there was no planned reopening.I was not sure I would stay here as a base for exploring Shanghai because of its distance from Puxi, but after the exceptional service, I would be delighted to stay here again in the future.Tip: if your cabbie does not know its English name, ask for the &quot;ruiji hongta jiudian.&quot; Hongta means red tower in Chinese, and the tower really does have lights that outline it in red from top to bottom. Starwood is not good about giving Chinese names for its hotels in China, so make sure you get the name and address of this and any other hotel in China in Chinese by calling the hotel before you arrive, or have a cell phone you can hand to the cabbie. "
st regis shanghai ,"thumbs up for the executive lounge my teenager son and i had a room on the 20th floor with 2 double beds with use of the executive lounge. the size of the room is very spacious, tastefully decorated, very largebathroom with all the amenities that you need. we loved our beds because it was rather hard so if you are used to a soft mattress, then this may pose a slight problem.turn down service is great, always left slippers and chocolates for us. everyday, housekeeping also left us some fresh fruit and many bottles of water. for breakfast and evening happy hour from 5:30pm to 7pm we always went up to the executive lounge on 40th floor to enjoy a drink and nibblies plus the great skyline view of pudong. 2 particular exceptional employees made our stay that much more enjoyable..alexander and rain. they treated us like royalty and always addressed us by our last names and even remembered what we liked to drink so alexander would bring it to us. there was plenty to eat...always 2 hot appies plus many cold ones, cheeses, rolls, many desserts and fruit. we never had to go out for dinner afterwards because we were so well fed. what i liked about the st regis is that every staff member tried to accomodate every one of our needs...ex: my son and i were playing billiards on the fitness level but it was really warm so i told the pool attendant and immediately he called down and had the air condition come on full blast. if we needed this and that, they would always try their bestto accomodate with promptness and courtesy. this is what i found impressive. my only complaint is that we booked a tour to ZHOU ZHANG, water city, with the concierge and it wasn't too cheap but the tour company they used was HORRIBLE&gt;they picked us up at 8:30am then drove us to 2 other hotels to pick up 4 more passengers and by the time we got to our destination, it was over 2 1/2 hours long for our ride in this BEAT UP old mini van with very uncomfortable seats. the drive should have only been 1 1/2 hours long !!! if you are tall, like most north americans, this mini van would be awful because there isn't enough room for those long legs and the airconditioning isn't strong enough for summer heat. the tour of the water city was alsovery rushed, no time to pick up souvenirs at all. they then transported us to a so called&quot;first class chinese restaurant&quot; in ZHOU ZHANG, but the food was almost unedible !i am chinese and not a picky eater and my son and i barely touched our lunch ! for example, one dish was just scrambled eggs with onions (which wasn't bad), another dish was just fried up celery !!! we were also served some fish but it tasted like the gutter ! the restaurant was so cheap that we were only allowed ONE glass of either pop, water, or beer. this glass was no more than 150ml !!! any additional drinks, we needed to pay extra !!! afterall, we paid almost USD$200 for the two of us for this tour. I would suggest not to book with this tour company but pay a little more and book a private driver so it's a lot more comfortable and you can have more leisure time as you need it. by the end of the tour, i felt so claustrophobic and uncomfortble in this van that we got off early at another hotel stop instead of staying on for our own hotel which was another 20 min ride . by the next day, my 15 year old son was physically sick from all the heat in the van, all the traveling and the unedible lunch offered.definitely stay at the st regis shanghai but it is a little far from the center of the city which is on the other side of the river but taxis are cheap , for about $6 to 7 usd, you can get to the center of town. in addition, there is nothing much around the hotel except for a little convenient store around the side street and a few local restaurants that we never had time to try. my thumbs up for the hotel and its service but a big thumbs DOWN on the tour booked through the concierge at the hotel !!!! "
st regis shanghai ,"Great Hotel in Shanghai The St. Regis was a great hotel in Shanghai. The service was polished, the rooms were beautiful, and the food was delicious. During our stay in Shanghai, we also stayed at the Four Seasons and have to say that the St. Regis is a cut above that hotel. One minor drawback is that the St. Regis is a longer cab ride from some of the shopping and sites of Shanghai; however, this would not deter me from staying at this hotel again. This was a great property. "
st regis shanghai ,"Lived up to the Standard... We stayed three nights and as we got a 3 for 2 deal we could not fault value. The staff were attentive helpfully directing us about the city and we were glad that we changed our reservation from the more expensive Grand Hyatt which we felt to be a little stuffy. The subway is cheap and efficient and the Bund much quieter. However a trip to the Grand Hyatt (or is it the Park Hyatt...two hotels almost next door to each other..most confusing!) is worth it as the tower is indeed tall. However go up to their lounge for coffee and save the entrance fee to the public viewing gallery. Admittedly you are about 12 floors lower...but hey you are still a hell of a long way above everything else! Great pool with few people in it and the breakfast selection was not overrun with tourists as this seems to be more of a business hotel. We booked and executive package and got evening cocktails...well worth it as one one night we never made dinner as the food selection was enormous!Our Gripe......The fact that in the bedroom you are charged for the wi-fi Internet still bugs us. In the main areas it is complimentary, but why when far lesser chains offer free wi-fi do hotels still feel able to justify a charge???? "
st regis shanghai ,"A most extraordinary experience in Shanghai Had no idea what to expect of this hotel. The trip was a treat to myself, and I thought I'd go &quot;all out&quot;, so I booked the St. Regis.The exterior of the hotel is pretty plain, a tall thin dark bronze tower located in Pudong across the street from a gigantic apartment block, all very nondescript. The entry to the hotel is a large concrete drive on a busy corner with flagpoles. A bit of a turn off at first, but after the first day, the sight of those flagpoles became a comfort, like rounding the corner and catching the first sight of your house. Check in was a bit overwhelming, in a good way. I was welcomed by the door staff and escorted inside. The lobby is staggering in the restrained St Regis way with a large several-story open space finished in dark wood, stone and gold tones. The doorman handed me off to a trio of butlers and the reception staff, who organized my paperwork and introduced me to the hotel. Now, it was a long flight. I'm from Hawaii and due to some business constraints I had to fly from HNL to LAX to ORD to Shanghai. By the time I was standing at the reception desk I was a bit woozy. As the reception came to a close, the staff asked me to please wait a moment, at which point I absolutely knew that they realized I didn't belong here and were prepared to ship me out to someplace where I did. Instead, I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder, and was greeted by a tall, attractive woman who introduced herself as the general manager of the hotel! She welcomed me to Shanghai, asked me how my long flight was, asked me if there was anything I needed, thanked me for choosing the St Regis and sent me on my way. Should there ever be any doubt as to how to make a guest feel special, a GM or owner who takes the time to greet guests one on one does the trick. A butler showed me to my room. As a Starwood member (and arriving immediately after the conclusion of the Olympic Games), I was upgraded from a standard &quot;Deluxe&quot; room to a Mandarin Suite. The butler opened the door and my jaw fell to the floor. Larger than my first house with fourteen foot ceilings and a view that would not quit. Of course, I belong here now so I didn't let on to the butler how stunned I was. The entry was marble-floored and led into a living room with a couch, table and chairs, a cabinet with a flat screen TV on top, windows from waist to ceiling, and a large desk with a printer/fax, some reference books and a return. And an Aeron chair. Walk through double doors to the bedroom with a settee, king bed, armoire with a second flat screen, and further to the bathroom and the walk in closet. The bathroom has two entrances, one from the bedroom and one from the walk in closet. There is another flat screen in the bathroom, a separate shower and jacuzzi tub, and generous space. Everything was of the very best quality, and there was no doubt that I had arrived. The location was ok. The immediate area around the hotel, Pudong, is not a visitor-friendly locale. Streets are lined with walls as apartment blocks are built around very attractive courtyards that are walled and gated from the public. But it is very easy to get around to other parts of the city from here. And when you wanted to get out of the busy craziness of touristy places like the Bund, those flagpoles in front of the St Regis were welcome sight. The hotel also supplied me with a pocket card that had common translations in English and Chinese, along with common destinations and the hotel address all translated. I always felt confident that I could get in any cab (cabbies do NOT speak any English whatsoever) and find my way around, or at the least back to the hotel to start over. Food was very good, and, while I didn't try the flagship Danieli's, service was always polished and professional at the restaurant downstairs and room service. This would not be the place to stay if you're looking for action. The lounge was always quiet as was the rest of the hotel. Guests seemed to be around in the morning for breakfast, which was very busy, but then had things to do for the rest of their day and the hotel was very quiet. Very comfortable and relaxing after a days work and touring, but not exciting if you're looking to party. I loved this hotel. It was a comfortable, quiet, sumptuous respite from the polluted congestion of gorgeous Shanghai. "
st regis shanghai ,"Impeccable service at the St. Regis!! Without a doubt one of the most luxurious hotels in Shanghai. I walked into the lobby and my jaw dropped as I looked around. The staff is very formally dressed in tuxedos. Everyone is smiling and happy to greet you with a warm welcome. When we checked in I needed money. My bank has a partner bank in Shanghai. I wanted to go to that specific bank’s ATM. The concierge said it is too confusing to get there by myself. They offered to have one of their staff members accompany me so I wouldn’t get lost. I was very impressed with their offer. The St. Regis pays extra special attention to detail in trying to make your stay more comfortable. There is a fruit basket and water in the room and flowers in the bathroom. The room is spacious and the bathroom is lavish with marble floors, sink and very nice rain shower. The Italian team of the Grand Prix stayed in the hotel during our stay. The entire front end staff greeted the returning team with champagne after the race because they came in second. We got to witness the celebration. The staff went all out for the celebration. I didn’t have a lot of free time to walk around the local area because we were always on a time schedule with the tour. We did take a cab to an Italian restaurant which was about 35 minutes away from our hotel. The fare was only $6 US…amazing!! The driver didn’t speak any English but tried to show us all of the important sights on the drive to the restaurant. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I visited Shanghai in the future. "
st regis shanghai ,"Loved my stay at the St. Regis I loved my 8 night stay at the St. Regis!!! The hotel was beautiful, the food at Danieli's restaurant on the 39th floor was fabulous, the breakfast buffet was good &amp; the room was incredibly comfortable. I stayed on one of the women only floors which is a very nice feature that they offer, it makes you feel a bit safer as a woman traveller. The St Regis is everything you would expect from a five star hotel but the only thing that did not seem five star were the doormen, there just was not the same level of friendliness that I have received at other five star properties. Overall a fabulous hotel &amp; being close to a Metro station was perfect!Note: Taxi's in Shanghai are very inexpensive but the traffic is miserable the Metro is a quick way to get around. "
st regis shanghai ,"Good But Some Very Annoying Gremlins Stayed in the St Regis for 3 nights based on the reviews on tripadvisor and also as I had some Starwood points to redeem. Having previously stayed at The Shangrila and Eton Hotels in Shanghai, was looking forward to staying in the St Regis as i had read so many good tghings about it.What was GoodQuality of hotel is very good. This includes public spaces such as lobby, pool area, gym and the bedroom. All are of a high standard and no complaints.Room (not exec room) was spacious enough and bathrooms were very well fitted out with marble floors, large bath and rain shower. Bed was very comfortable and tv had a reasonable number of engllish language channels considering its China.Not so GoodSeems as though they started to charge for wireless internet access even though the inroom guide says its still free and nothing on the opening web page suggests that you will be charged for it. On checking out I noticed that they had charged me 100RMB a night and when I complained the manager stated that they had just started to introduce charges ! At the very least guys, please inform guests upfront about the change in policy !For a business hotel, hotel seemed to be dead at night. Maybe due to mid autumn holiday but the place just lacked any atmosphere. Totally different from the Shangri la which is always buzzing.If you fancy a late night drink in the bar, seems as though they shut at midnight which for a 5 star hotel in Shanghai is ridiculous.I found the service in the executive room strangely cold. Going for cocktails with a friend at 6.30 got totally ignored by the lady there and had to walk up and ask her for a drink. Also dont expect there to be much food left if you arrive late for 5.30- 7pm drinks after 6.30pm !Location isnt great for tourists although it is only a 5 min walk from the underground. You are right in the middle of Pudong which isnt the most exciting place in the world ! "
st regis shanghai ,"Everything You Want And More Everything works exactly the way it should at the St. Regis Shanghai. And, considering the service economy gap that currently exists throughout China, that's no mean feat. This hotel is a respite and an oasis from the other &quot;pretenders&quot; which are desperate for Western business but really can't provide the comfort, cleanliness and language facility required. Service and amenities match, if not exceed, the other Starwood luxury properties. And the pictures don't lie. The hotel actually looks the way it appears on the Internet glamour shots. True, the hotel is in Pudong and the trek to Puxi can be hellish in Shanghai traffic but taxis are dirt cheap -- no more than 35 yuan (5.11 USD) even in the heaviest congestion -- so your major expenditure is time (approx 40 minutes in rush hour traffic), not money. On the brightside, given the Pudong location, the airport is only 50 minutes from the hotel (fare approx 140 RMB; 20.44 USD). That's a bonus when you have an early morning flight, as I did. And some of the touristy things you'll want to do -- the Oriental Pearl TV tower and Shanghai history museum; the Jinmao tower and the restaurants and bars of the Grand Hyatt (e.g., Cloud 9); Shanghai Uncle; the Riverside Promenade along the backside of the Oriental Riverside Hotel property; the Oriental Art Center; etc. are in Pudong anyway.The St. Regis Shanghai butler service is quite swank. So, if you're more of a do-it-yourself person, it'll take some getting used to. But you'll acclimate quickly! I highly recommend butler Melannie Zhang. She was a sweet, bright, quick and accommodating young lady. Not hard or jaded at all. I'm not sure if you can ask for butlers by name, but, if possible, I'd request her assistance if I were you. "
st regis shanghai ,"Superb Hotel with Excellent Service! I stayed at St. Regis Shanghai from 14/07/08 to 18/07/08. There is only one word to describe the place - SUPERB.Distance between the hotel and Pudong Int'l Airport is about 45km (1 hr drive). Checking in was a breeze. Service is top notch with each staff greeting me whenever I am in the hotel. The room is big and clean. The bathroom has mirrors on all walls and there is a choice of using the shower cubicle or the huge bath tub. Bathroom amenities are complete - shower gel, shampoo, body lotion, talcum powder, cotton buds, etc. Internet is free and hence business travellers will find it very convenient.The hotel is located with restaurants on the opposite street. Just behind the hotel is a 24hr convenience shop and a coffee club. If you choose to walk a little further (10 minutes), try Lao Shan Road where there are many other Chinese seafood restaurants and fruit stalls. Overall experience - very satisfied. "
st regis shanghai ,Superior Service The employees of this hotel bend over backwards for their guests. Every detail is addressed. The hotel is in the business district of Shanghai but very easy to get around. Our only complaint is that beds are hard as rocks. 
st regis shanghai ,"Only 4 not 41!/2 !! Although this is a very nice hotel, I think that it has been overrated slightly. It is definitely a &quot;4&quot;, but hotels in Beijing were much nicer.Our breakfast was served to our tour as a group and was very nice, but not outstanding. Beds were comfortable and the room was very clean and had nice amenities. "
st regis shanghai ,"Loved the St. Regis The hotel car service from the airport was excellent, on arrival at the hotel we were shown straight to our room. The room was spacious and the bathroom luxurious. We found all the staff to be very attentive and friendly. We stayed for one night on our way to Beijing and wish we had stayed for longer. Our favourite hotel during our two week trip to China. "
st regis shanghai ,"Terrific Hotel I stayed at the hotel in late January to attend an investment conference taking place at the nearby Shangri-La Hotel (which was double the price at the time because of the conference). I had stayed at the hotel before when it had opened 6-7 years ago, and had expected that it might have deteriorated since then - but nothing was further from the truth. The lobby was just as grand, the rooms were incredibly plush and comfortable, and the room had a very well designed desk and a comfortable chair for work, and with excellent lighting. Bathrooms also kept in top condition, with a very pleasant rain shower.The service was also impeccable from top to bottom, and the lounge upstairs was worthy of rivalling any Starwood property.In fact, since my stay in 2001, it had become a much more convenient location as the city had built up around the hotel, and in addition to the hotel restaurants, there is an excellent Shanghainese restaurant just outside the hotel's front door (to the left on the same street). Loads of cabs hang around now.Pudong might not be everyone's cup of tea (it is still a little bit more planned and sterile than PuXi - Singapore to Hong Kong comparison west of the river, perhaps) but I thought the property itself is great. It's certainly easy to get to from the Pudong International Airport.I will definitely come back. "
st regis shanghai ,"A great Hotel for a business stay. I spent a week at the St. Regis. The staff, rooms, meals, all were first class. The staff at the St Regis is GREAT, they will make your stay a pleasure. I never had any concern for anything, from the car service to and from the airport to them adding a pillow top to my bed to make it softer.The hotel is not in a shopping district or a night club area, if you want that then stay on the other side of the river in old Shanghai, but for a great relaxing stay after work, you can't beat this place.One last thing, check out Malones American Cafe on the other side of town for a cold beer and a great burger too. "
st regis shanghai ,"Luxury in Shanghai The St. Regis Shanghai outdid itself with service when we went there for three days to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Although I had booked a discount rate (3 nights with one night free, total price $558 including fees and taxes), we were treated like royalty. The room was luxurious with wonderful beds and the softest sheets. The spotless marble bathroom was huge with a soaking tub and rainforest shower. Our room was supplied with complimentary fresh fruit and drinking water at all times. All guests are invited to the executive lounge on the 40th floor for an elaborate breakfast spread, complete with brie. Drinks and desserts are served in the evening. There is free wireless access in the room, but if you don't want to carry your laptop, you can check your email in the executive lounge, and even borrow a book to read from the library. The pool was also a pleasure. For my daughter's birthday the hotel staff went all out: cookies and her favorite fruit (kiwi) on arrival with a birthday present, a darling panda stuffed animal. When we returned to the room that evening, they had delivered a dozen red roses and a cake that said happy birthday, complete with her name. The staff was helpful in every way, and the concierge accomodated my desire to travel by ferry, subway and foot as well as taxi by writing me little notes in Chinese to use all day long. We hated to leave such a wonderful hotel! "
st regis shanghai ,"Marvellous Pudong Place The St. Regis purely is marvellous. I've never stayed in a hotel like this and I'm sure it'll take a while until I will find a compareable hotel again.I was working in Shanghai for 5 weeks and decided to call the St. Regis home for this time - not a bad decision. The staff's great, the service excellent and the rooms are really big. No matter what room, the bathroom is impressive and the rainforest shower simply one of the best ways to start your day.We enjoyed breakfast in the Executive Lounge which is free for SPG, the area around the hotel is great as well. You don't have to eat in the hotel, there are better places around where you can get authentic chinese food, even if you don't speek the language. Here's a must: leave the lobby, turn right and walk through the tiny park until you hit the next street, turn right again and sit down at one of the food places on the street - it's delicious. "
st regis shanghai ,"Great Spent 2 nights here as part of a Viking River Cruise Tour. The room was great, the service was great, the food was great, altho the only meal we ate here was breakfast. The upstairs bar makes the best cosmo I've ever had (no I didn't have one for breakfast). All-in-all, I've have to say SR was just great! "
st regis shanghai ,"Loved this place except for the location I spent a week here on business and found the St Regis to be an oasis.The room was beautiful and the bathroom was divine. The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. The executive lounge access is limited to a higher level of booking though. It is a very intimate, quiet venue with a great view of the sunset.I found the complimentary breakfast very nice. They have a great cup of coffee and feature dumplings, and Chinese food in addition to all the usual things westerners desire.The exercise amenities are simply superb. They have a more than adequate selection of eliptical, tradmill, bike and rowing machines in addition to a full set of machines and free weights. Even more, men and women enjoy separate steam, sauna, and jacuzzi amenities. And then there is the beautiful pool. And also a rooftop tennis court. It just keeps going. If you need a place to live while in Shanghai, this is a good choice since it offers such a variety of amenities. I found the Cantonese food in the on-site Chinese restaurant too bland and not surprisingly, overpriced. However, the Pudong area will demand a level of competency in Mandarin that might restrict you to the hotel venues. Once across the river, things are a bit easier for the language-challenged traveler.Only one disappointment. . .I received a &quot;visit the 2nd floor gift shop for a free gift&quot; card in my check-in package. Baloney! This is a scam based on selling reproductions of traditional art that requires buying a 300RMB silk mounting. Don't fall for it - Shanghai is full of art scams and it disappoints me that one is located in the St. Regis. I really enjoyed this hotel. And while I have no other &quot;St Regis experience&quot; to measure against, I look forward to staying there again and recommend it. "
st regis shanghai ,"Took good care of us! Having stayed in so many top-rank international hotels with hefty fees for everything, I found the St. Regis refreshing. From the start, we were welcomed, with our butler and bellboy showing us to our room. Although we were on a group tour, we were invited to the top-floor executive lounge, and given tea and hot hors d'oeuvres during happy hour at no charge. Internet terminals in the business center were a steep 90 yuan for half an hour - but both times I used them, they didn't charge. Even the laundry fees and the price of toothpaste in the lobby shop were quite reasonable. So we felt like the St Regis was really interested in taking care of us.Our basic room was comfortable and good-sized with a large bathroom, and separate tub and rainforest shower.As much as we liked the St. Regis, I wouldn't recommend it for tourists on their own, just because the Pudong location is far from anything of interest and not convenient to the metro. If you do stay there, and are a light sleeper, avoid the Dongfang Road side, where the views are nothing special and the incessant Shanghai honking is quite audible even on the 15th floor. "
st regis shanghai ,"Best hotel in China From the moment we arrived here, the experience was wonderful. The staff were so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The room was amazing with the biggest and most opulent marble bathroom ever. The bed was to die for with divine pillows that you never wanted to get up from. The butler service was excellent. The best part of the stay was the amazing pool, which we had all to ourselves one evening, and the executive lounge, with complimentary canapes and cocktails/champagne/wine. Breakfast and dinner were fabulous in the hotel - one of the restaurants is open 24hours a day. The concierge was amazing here - we were expecting delivery of a package to the hotel during our stay, but it didn't arrive. The concierge undertook to forward it to us in our home country when it arrived and this all happened without any difficulty. Quite the best place I have ever stayed. "
st regis shanghai ,"An _almost_ St. Regis Having experienced other St. Regis properties (New York, Aspen), I think this property is actually a sister Starwood brand (a Westin) gussied up to embellish the portfolio. In other words, since there already is a Westin in Shanghai, I think Starwood decided to market this property as a more upmarket St. Regis so as not to crowd its branding strategy.I say this because although the hotel features many of the amenities one might expect to find in a St. Regis, they seem to be thrown together in a &quot;let's check it off the list&quot; sort of way. Which is, I realize, a very subjective denunciation, but that was my distinct impression nevertheless. There was nothing especially wrong and I can't fault any one element of my stay in particular. The exterior of the hotel is aesthetically unremarkable and occupies an undistinguished stretch of a busy commercial road (nothing worthwhile within walking distance as far as I could see). On the other hand, my room was immaculate and in good order. The bathroom was modern and marbled. The food in the lobby restaurant was okay and the service was decent. The fitness center and pool were fine and the free, in-room wi-fi was on par. But put all together, nothing distinguished my three-night stay as anything more extraordinary than something I'd expect from a competent business-oriented hotel. I guess I'm damning this property with faint praise.One thing worth noting: for those visitors who intend to spend a majority of their time visiting old Shanghai (the Bund, Yu Gardens, Xintiandi, the Jade Buddha Temple, etc.) do note that those attractions are mainly to be found on the west bank of the Huangpu River, in Puxi. This hotel is located very much in Pudong and will necessitate some expense of cab time in order to visit many of the more interesting sites. "
st regis shanghai ,"Great hotel and service Stayed here for one night on my last trip to Shanghai, immediately after staying at Le Royal Meridien. Hotel check-in was very quick and was shown to my room (upgraded to a suite based on my Starwood status). Executive lounge is open to all guests of the hotel and the spread was a bit disappointing but similar to what I have experienced at St. Regis Beijing - I prefer spread at hotels with a closed off Executive/Club floor since food/drink selection is generally better. Anyhow, the room was nice, though I found the suite decor a bit plain (still nice). Nice, large bathroom with a TV over tub. Staff was very helpful and spoke good English, and butler service was great throughout the stay. I'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it if you are in Pudong - do be aware that if you are looking to do the more touristy attractions its a bit far from Central Shanghai - Le Royal Meridien is right in the middle of the action on the other hand. "
st regis shanghai ,Nice Hardware I actually stayed at this property for over a month. The room at the St. Regis was at that time the largest in Shanghai. The hardware of the hotel was actually the best that I have ever seen in Shanghai as many parts including the marble floors were imported from Italy.Try the Italian restaurant on the top floor or go for a swim in the large pool. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone. 
st regis shanghai ,"Top notch accomodations From the moment you walk in, excellent.Room: Spacious with large windows and excellent curtains. Everything worked (lights, tv, radio, faucets, etc.) Iron in the room, mini bar and plenty of space for luggage. Somewhat noisy due to traffic, but that's the traffic's fault.Restaurants: We only ate at the coffee shop, so we did not get a full spectrum of their restaurants, but the breakfast buffet was one of the best we have had.Bar: Expensive, but that's the way it is.Facilities: Free internet for less than 10 minutes and WiFi available for free. Business facilities are good. Exercise facilities are amazing.Location: Very close to a train station, if you're so inclined. Taxis convenient. Not very convenient to shopping locations, but if you're willing to jump in a cab, it's an easy trip.Hotel Pens: Steal one. They are great. "
st regis shanghai ,"Top score for St. Regis We had 4 nights (pay 3 get 1 free) at the St. Regis from 3-7 November. Arrived after 10pm.from Hong Kong and during the limo ride to the hotel, the driver was in contact with the hotel at least 2 times, saying when we were expected to arrive. Upon arrival, doors opened, friendly faces lined up to greet us and it just kept getting better. We had a high floor room which was very large and luxurious (silk drapes, chaise longue, executive desk with very upmarket comfortable chair). The beautiful marble bathroom was unveiled behind double sliding doors and had every amenity the weary traveller could wish for. The bed and pillows were the most comfortable ever (being part of the Sheraton group). The executive rooms have 24-hour butler service and was much appreciated. The price included a superb buffet breakfast which was vast and would satisfy any palate - hot and cold choices were too numerous to relate here. The gym was a good size and very well-equipped. The whole hotel has an opulent feel and the staff are super-friendly and helpful - talk to you each morning while waiting for taxi into Puxi. Another advantage is that the Maglev train station is nearby on the Pudong side of the river and is well worth the 10 min. taxi ride to the airport to travel at 432kph. Very exciting and the only place in the world where you can do this. Loved Shanghai, the St. Regis and can't wait to have the opportunity to return. "
st regis shanghai ,"Absolutely The Best! Stayed at the St. Regis in September for 3 nights as part of a China tour. This was without a doubt the best &quot;5 star&quot; hotel I stayed at on the entire tour. I first stepped into the lobby of the hotel and said &quot;wow!&quot;. The opulence of the rooms and other decors were equally impressive. I had a nice view of downtown from my room. The included breakfasts were wonderful. The staff was courteous and helpful. I cannot comment on the surrounding area. As part of a tour group, I never had the opportunity to venture off. "
st regis shanghai ,"A 6 (Six) Star Hotel!! We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of China with Ritz tours in September. The St. Regis in Shanghai should be rated a 6 (Six) Star Hotel! It was absolutely wonderful in every way. The complementary room service is fabulous. It is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have traveled quite a lot, on business, in major cities. "
st regis shanghai ,"Good but shy of Great Stayed at the St. Regis for 6 nights recently. 4 for business and 3 with my wife for the weekend. Overall a pretty decent experience.The room was nice and spacious with large well stocked bathroom. The matress was pretty hard and does not compare with the soft beds at other Starwood properties. Food in the hotel was very good - the buffet breakfast and lunches were super. Service during our business meetings was excellent with very attentive staff on hand at all times. Desk staff and Concierge ranged from bad to great. When I asked one Concierge to book dinner reservations for Friday and Saturday nights at restaurants I chose he booked for Saturday and Sunday night. When I explained he was unappologetic did not offer to rectify the situation and did not seem to understand that I was not going to be in Shanghai on the Sunday night. On the other hand one of the desk staff went out of her way to recomend a great place to go for drinks and upon our request arranged to have the hotel car collect us for our trip to the airport at a small cafe miles from the hotel. The car, loaded with our luggage, arrived in the right place at the right time and we made it to the airport without a hitch.The location is clearly not the best but taxis are so cheap and the trip to the other side of the river is not much of a hassle.It is possible to get a really good rate most likely because of the location. "
st regis shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel! I simply cannot understand some of the negative posts about the location of this hotel. There is a subway stop just outside! The St. Regis Shanghai is a wonderful hotel in every way. Outstanding rooms, cleanliness, fixtures and service. Excellent gym as well with 2 great billiard tables. It is easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Airport pick up was flawless, check in smooth and fast. The view from the club on the top floor is great. We stayed for one night on our way to Xian to see the warriors and I would highly recommend the hotel as one of the best 5 star hotels in Asia. Don't be put off by the location. The subway ride to Nanking Road is worth it for the extra big rooms and service. The Westin does not compare! "
st regis shanghai ,"Wow! The most beautiful hotel experience I can remember. Location is not great if you're there for a shopping trip but given it's so cheap to get a taxi, it doesn't matter so much. Every aspect of my stay from the arrival where check-in is conducted in the room to the butler service with complimentary coffee/tea (and hot chocolate if you ask nicely) delivered to your room when you want it, 24 hours a day :)Room was excellent size and beautifully decorated. Bed had pillows you could melt into. Bathroom was quality too. Buffet breakfast was sublime, best one I've ever had as quality of the food used was so good. Great hotel, would definitely recommend and stay there again. "

sun island golf hotspring resort ,"The Stall of the Golf Course very rude but this is the main reason to stay there. I am going to bullet my experience:- location is an hour plus from Shanghai downtown, one way by hotel shuttle, fees- Western restaurant on location, the western food not so good, wine selection limited.- Chinese restaurant on location, Dynasty is more like cafeteria style (food is so so), Zen Den Herbal Restaurant food is good and staffs are friendly, some authentic dishes I enjoyed. The other Chinese restaurants are consolidated to Zen Den. Korean restaurant have not tried.- Spa is clean, staffs are friendly. - Golf, I did not play because I was turned off by the staff while checking out the golf course.- The other facilities ( go kart, archery, ping pong, pool) are just average at most.- Craft studio is closed,- From location you can hire a car and driver to take you to Suzhou City, Hangzhou City, Zhouzhuang, Da Guan Yuan Garden, Zhujiajiao, Shesshan. Beware time of travel takes longer than estimate due to weather and traffic congestion. The further the destination, allow more time than estimated. The drivers are very friendly but with limited English skill. Make sure to wear the seat belt as the drive by ifself is an experience.- The staffs have limited speaking skill.B.Fu, California "
sun island golf hotspring resort ,"Loved Sun Island My husband and I traded our Tahoe Time Share for a week at the Sun Island International Resort [-]. This is located about 45 minutes west of Shanghai on an island in the River Mao. The resort occupies most of the island and includes 2 extremely nice golf courses, a spa, several restaurants, a horse riding ring, an outdoor pool/slide area (closed fall/winter), a Go-cart track and many other “activity” venues. Bicycle rental is on the island within the resort and shuttles instantaneously appear at your door whenever you want to go from one part of the resort to another. Note though – activities are seasonal and if you want a FULL experience (wave pools, etc) go in the summer.The resort was very, very nice, well kept, clean, and a wonderful place to stay. The grounds and gardens are spectacular and they have an army of gardeners to keep it so. We were there in October 2008 during National Day holidays. When we arrived, the resort (which is generally frequented by Chinese families), was empty. On National Day and through the weekend, it was full. Trading a time-share is particularly good, because Interval International (the organization one trades timeshares through) provides you with a “Guide” who takes care of any arrangements you may need or want. Our guide was a wonderful young woman named Elaine and we relied on her a great deal to arrange trips into Shanghai, getting back to the airport, etc. We had difficulty arranging things at first because the website was in the process of being rebuilt and was not accessible in English so we weren’t sure how to get there from the airport. We finally called the resort and they arranged a driver to pick us up at the PuDong airport (and hour and a half drive from the resort). Mr. Su was at the airport when we arrived and took us to the resort for a flat fee of $335 RMB and all was well. There seem to be a number of “business” meetings and often the restaurants had business groups. However, it was never over-crowded and we were always able to get a table. There are several restaurants at the resort so there is a wide variety of choices for meals. There is even a “western” restaurant where an incredible breakfast buffet is served that includes made-to-order omelets and a number of Chinese and western dishes. Restaurant will also deliver to your lodging (we even did that one night). The accommodations were great – we had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath chalet type of lodging. Many lodgings are stand-alone. It sort of has a “Tudor England” style to it. Our unit had 2 stories with a living room, kitchen, bath and bedroom downstairs and a bath/bedroom upstairs. I can’t say enough for the service, cleaning, maintenance, and shuttle. It was all really well done and reliable. The pictures on their website are recent and shows how it really looks including the furnishings, etc.Getting to Shanghai from the resort involved buying a ticket on the shuttle which is scheduled to go at 9AM and return at 9PM and costs 50RMB per person. If you (or your group) are the only people going to Shanghai, you can and go/return any time you’d like (minimum charge is for 3 people). We did that 3 days and spent the days wandering through different sections of Shanghai. It was really convenient and the drive into Shanghai city center is only about 45 minutes (traffic included). Would we recommend Sun Island? Absolutely. Especially if you are a golfer or a Spa fan. "
sun island golf hotspring resort ,"Excellent We have just returned from a week at the Shanghai Sunisland Golf Club Resort. The resort is excellent. When we reach there, we were picked up by the hotel mini van which we book earliers. The drive from Pudong Int'n Airport to Sunisland is 1hr 45 mins. We reach the resort around 9.pm and was greeted by Joyce, whom is allocated to us to attend to our needs. The check in took only 15 mins. She bring us to our chalet and the chalet is wonderful. The resort has a horse range, go-kart, spa, golf and swimming pool. All these you have to pay in order to enjoy the facilities. The weather in Shanghai at the time is ending of spring. So, is a bit cooling. As the resort is located outskirt which is near Zhang Jia Jiou, the air in the morning is so refreshing. Our resort is full of beautiful flowers and trees. All the chalet are name according to the trees and flowers that are grown around that areas. The resort come with 4 restaurants ie Korean restaurant, Chinese Restaurant, the one allocate in the main lobby and last one is the Szechuan Restaurant. The restaurant that we been to is mostly the Chinese Restaurant whereby the food is pretty good and reasonable.As for the pool, I have no comments because unable to use it because it is closed and only opened in 6/6/2008. As for the horse ride and the go-kart, both of my sons love it. Both of my sons is between the age of 13 and 6.The place that I stay is near Zhang Jia Jiou and surrounding this area there is a beautiful sight seeing place where the Mission Impossible Three has been filmed. The scenery there is beautiful. That is the place whereby we bought a lot of paintings and sourvenirs. A word of advise, must bargain.The service provided is excellent. There is one time where our burner has some short circute and we ask for room service and within 10 mins the technician came. Talking about fast service.In the resort, they also provide shuttle bas to drive you to any destination inside the resort. You only need to give room service a call.Overall I would say this is a good resort and the service is excellent.The only down part is very far from Shanghai town. "

swissotel grand shanghai ,"Found cockroach in the room - Lousy customer service Had a negative experience staying in this hotel. At first glance, the hotel seems to be good - clean spacious room &amp; bathroom, with good choices of breakfast. However, when I returned to the room on the 2nd night, I found a big cockroach running around in the bedroom. I immediately called the receptionist and they told me they will send someone up. I had to wait for 20 minutes and had to call again to remind them that I'm still waiting for someone to come. The staff did come and she expressed her disbelief. and after looking around, she finally managed to catch the cockroach. No apology was offered by the staff or by the receptionist. As it happened quite late in the night and I was already exhausted, I decided not to demand to change the room and decided to sleep. After my stay, a survey by email was sent out and I voiced out my feedback. The reply that came was addressed to someone else (A Mr XXX instead of my name) and only say the usual thing: &quot;We truly apologize for inconvenience caused and we hope you'll come back and visit us next time&quot; I will definitely NOT recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel unless the customer service is improved. It's really a disappointing &amp; unpleasant experience. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,Great Hotel Lousy Staff... i'm not sure if anyone encountered the same thing as me... As long as u are yellow and speak mandarin you get a downgraded service attitude from the chinese staff there... well... you'll be disappointed to see your double &quot;queen&quot; size beds... they are just super singles... maybe they can do something about the bathroom... i shared the room with my business partner... i can see her brushing on my bed... 
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Shanghai oct 2009 Great hotel! Nice location, good service, great room etc. Highly recommend for others. Will stay here if I'll come back! "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Its not luxurious but a good quality Hotel This was my first stay in Shanghai and for sure not my last! I wasn't sure where to stay, but was looking for a Hotel in Puxi as I was looking to explore the city also at night. I got a great deal at the Swissotel. From Pudong International I took the Maglev train and later a taxi- make sure you got directions in mandarin. If you just have light baggage you might be able to transfer from Maglev to the subway- directly to Jing An Temple. As the Hotel is next to a subway station the location is quiet good. There are some restaurants and a mall as well as the Jing An temple around the corner. I arrived early from Europe, but they haven't a room ready for me, so I took a few laps in their pool to refresh. Even afterwards they kept me waiting until a women from front office recognized that I am still around and checked me in within a few seconds. I got a standard room facing the mall- so no nice view. the room was fairly large and the bathroom comes with bathtub and a separate shower. Internet was included in the room rate and worked fine. I had breakfast twice in their restaurant which was alright, but nothing special. I guess everybody will find something but it won't thrill me to get up early. Breakfast from room service was not on par of a 5 star hotel and they charged me even so breakfast was included in the room rate. Never had this before. The pool and wellness area is well done, but the shower and restrooms are a little dirty. If you are seeking a posh luxurious hotel stay somewhere else- for a relaxed stay in Puxi the Swissotel would still be my choice. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"A good choice in Shanghai! Just came back from a trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Swissotel Grand during my six nights there. The location of the hotel is great, near the subway and there are malls and eating places close by, and you can grab a cab easily at the entrance. It's a rather touristy area though, and there is a fair amount of construction going on in the buildings around, as with many areas in the city.Had a long, tiring flight and appreciated the quick check in, the staff communicated pretty well in English and the lobby was nice and modern. Good first impression, made even better by our free upgrade to the premier room. The lift area and the corridor was elegant and of good furnishing, usually a tell-tale sigh if a hotel is worth its stars. The room was good too, not particularly large but spacious enough, with all you expect from a luxury hotel, plasma tv, very comfortable arm-chair and work desk and subtle lights everywhere. I like the clean, modern style, nothing shabby in this hotel, but then again I believe it is a fairly new one. The bathroom was impressive, although the bathtub was a little small and we didn't use it at all. Very nice amenities, and the room was cleaned well everyday. All in all a very pleasant stay at a fabulous rate (less than USD 100 a night!), and would certainly stay here again if I do visit the city again. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Very Nice Hotel-Watch the construction I agree with pretty much all that was in the last review, but my experience was the location was just fine. The subway is right around the corner so you can get to the Bund in 20 minutes.All the amenities are what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, it is very comfortable and service was very good. In my opinion the beds were quite comfortable. One thing I would watch though is, like most of Shanghai, there are some major construction projects going on around the hotel. From the looks of things they will be going for quite a while and the work goes 24/7. So if you are a light sleeper, this might be a problem. But because of this there are some really good deals out there. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Good business hotel but not as good for leisure travelers I had the opportunity to stay at the Swissotel Grand Shanghai for a few nights in mid-September for a business trip. The location of the hotel for my purposes couldn't be beat (3-5 minute walk to Park Place, an office building with various companies' offices). It's located close to several major malls (think luxury stores like Fendi, Tiffany &amp; Co, etc.) that have good restaurants and shopping. The hotel itself is nothing too special. It is pretty new, so the rooms, lobbies, restaurants, etc. have a nice, modern look and feel. High speed internet is available (for a fee, although it was included in my company's negotiated room rate) and worked without any problems during my stay. Bed was comfortable (I had 1 king bed), bathroom was a good size (with separate tub and shower), and all the typical amenities were there (kettle for tea, minibar, 2 free bottles of bottled water/night, slippers, robe, umbrella, toiletries, hairdryer). TV service in the room was pretty good too. A variety of both Chinese and international channels (including CNN, BBC, National Geographics, Discovery Channel, some German stations). Hotel does have 24 hr room service, but I didn't utilize this.Breakfast buffet as ok - not as good as the international breakfast buffets I've had at other high end Chinese hotels (such as Tianlun in Beijing). There was the typical western offerings of eggs made to order, bacon, yogurt, cereal, baked beans, and a variety of regular and sweet breads/rolls. There was also Chinese breakfast offerings including steamed buns (roast pork, sweet bean paste buns), dumplings, congee and a noodle bar (where you choose what you want in your noodles from an assortment of offerings). Beverages included the usual coffee and hot tea, as well as milk, fruit juices (apple, orange, grapefruit, etc) and both hot and cold soy bean milk. Service at the hotel was ok. Not superb, but not subpar, just ok, nothing special. Overall, had a good stay here and would definitely stay here again if I were back on another business trip to the same office. If I were vacationing in Shanghai, I'd probably choose a hotel closer to the tourist attractions (to illustrate, a taxi to Yu Yuan Gardens took about 20 minutes). "
swissotel grand shanghai ,Excellent value in a 5 star hotel Very nice suite with sitting room. Excellent service. Enjoyed the hotel and its location. The executive floor offered very nice refreshments and snacks in the afternoon. Breakfast was good too. 
swissotel grand shanghai ,"5 Star Hotel without any service! In-room dining menu is limited and it took ages for the food to be served. We ordered spaghetti bolognese - definitely the worst pasta we ever had. Club Sandwich was no where near a cafe's standard even. Hotel staff... definitely do NOT know how to smile. i paid for price to enjoy a 5 star standard, unfortunately... they were not able to deliver any. we wrote a feedback form... and NO service recovery was being done! NEVER even think of staying there! "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Great location and great room with fabulous view! I loved everything about this hotel, including high tea, the breakfast and the dinners each night weren't bad either. My room had a fabulous view, was modern and everything worked. I loved the small but efficient closets. My only complaint is why a 5 star hotel must charge for internet access when lots of less expensive hotels offer it for free. I guess just one more way to make money. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"smelly rooms gravestone mattress far away from typical swiss In a few words, the rooms smell of something weird but can give you a headache. We changed three rooms already but still the same smell. Poor room arrangement as the room is ideal for single occupancy only given that there is no privacy in the bathrooms. Poor pressure in the water and not hot water. The mattress is like a gravestone, the breakfast buffet is average quality and guess what?? the spa treatments are a joke. DEFINETELY not a SWISS experience, probably UGADA like. The location though is fantastic. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Excellent business hotel! Excellent 5* business hotel with great service.The rooms are a bit on the small side with very little storage room. The bathroom has everything you need. The bath tub is redundant as it is VERY small. Even for asian people. Could´ve been used by dwarfs though...The workstation in the room was perfect! A desk with a proper comfortable leather chair. Brett the 20 something shy bartender is very well trained and taught me a couple of things about cocktails, single malts and vodka that I didn´t know. Location is very good. Next door there´s a shopping mall, there are restaurants in the direct vecinity, and you´re about 3km from the Bund. Xian Tien Di, a restaurant and bar area visited by a mixture of expats, asian and western tourists and locals is a 10-15min taxiride away. Too bad they charge (a lot) for internet. 30 RMB per hour or 120 RMB per day. It should be complimentary in business hotels nowadays. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Excellent service clean rooms top rate accommodations I stayed here for two nights during a busy weekend. The check-in was painless with the staff putting up with my groggy mindset from the trans-pacific jet-lag. The service is impeccable, the hotel was spotless. The floors are card controlled so you don't have to worry about random people wandering the halls. The room service was professional and impeccable. Two issues with the place:1) The elevators go at a very leisurely place for a 5 star hotel2) the cost of wireless 120 RMB/night is bloody murder in a country that the average person makes 100 RMB/day "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Unexpected gem I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this hotel. It is very well apppointed and tastefully decorated. The buffet breakfast included in the price offered a vast array of different food, enough to keep us full for most of the day. The room was spotless and very comfortable and the staff was really helpful. The only problem I saw was charging 15% service fee on the bar ans restaurant bills but otherwise, the experience provided here was an unexpected gem. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Not really worth the price ... I have stayed in many hotels in the Jing An area of Shanghai, and this one isn't really worth the price. The hotel is brand new and very stylish. The rooms have virtually no storage, have easily a dozen light switches that are difficult to figure out, have no privacy in the bathroom, charge for Internet connection (that is hardly ultra fast as they describe in their website), and have too few staff at reception that arefriendly but poorly trained. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Nice modern and clean Hotel - Central to all locations in Shanghai Stayed here for 3 days in February.It was a nice hotel and amenities. The rooms are on the small side - the shower and bath area is amazing.Great spa, pool and sauna and fitness area.Great buffet and food service - very obliging concierge team and easy to get in and out of the hotel via taxis.The experience was soured by some ordinary staff at the check in point - however, a Manager soon sorted them and us out.Overall a pleasant stay.Close to subways and shops and general store for those extra supplies and food. Chemist and Burger King across the road. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"the perfect Shanghai experience Swissotel Grand Shanghai is a beautiful, spacious, new hotel in the best possible location for seeing old and new Shanghai. It's considered to have such a positive atmosphere that the Abbot from the adjacent Jing An Temple chose to do a special ceremony there during last week's Spring Festival, and this is hugely important. I experienced the staff as cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable and truly a step above staff in other 5star hotels in china. Remember, this is China, so training staff in western hospitality practices is a new field and Swissotel is getting it right. I enjoyed the lounges, fitness and spa facilities as welcome breaks from the cacaphony of Shanghai; the meals were healthy, varied, and excellent; and business comunication/tech support worked flawlessly. The concierge arranged excellent side trips and entertainment. what more can I say? "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Top notch facility in need of drastic service quality upgrade My husband and I stayed at this hotel between Xmas and New Year. We were fortunate to find a holiday package deal that was good enough that I said to Claude that I would be less critical to the service aspect of the experience.And the facility turned out to be great, with chic decor and furnishing, spacious room and an abundance of amenities. At the price we paid, this was an absolute steal.The downside of the whole experience was the service quality, though much as expected for new hotels in China. A couple areas worth pointing out for management cue are as follows: We had breakfast included in our rates, so after 7 days, we had grown from being frustrated to being amused at the lack of professionalism of the breakfast staff. Many were too inexperienced to handle the crowd, and the senior ones had a nonchalant look on their faces. We watched one man's experience ordering a cup of coffee with four different attendants and had to look for the coffee pot on his own at the end. The breakfast experience was bad enough that we didn't think it was worth having just to start the day on the wrong note.The other place I would love to have spent more time but retreated given the lack of courtesy was the fitness center, particularly the young lady in the evening shift. My husband and I were levied this sense of guilt every time we used the facilities towards the later end of the day. Unless she is related to someone of power, I would suggest beefing up her attitude.During the check out, as I expected, unless you watched each item carefully, you could easily lose a few hundred US dollars. All the items that were included in our package were charged as a la carte. Surprised? No. Intentional? Hard to say.All in, we enjoyed spending 8 days in this beautiful and new hotel that is close to many attractions in Shanghai, especially given the price we paid. Would we revisit at the published price without the service seeing a major pick-up? probably not. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Excellent Expierence I recently stayed at this hotel Nov 28-30th (15th floor city facing room, nice view) at the end of my trip through Asia. Based on other reviews I had been delaying my booking of any hotel in Shanghai as the longer I waited the cheaper the prices got and I would reccomend that others do the say in the end I saved several hundred dollars. I was rewarded with an amazing weekend deal that was less than half of the other hotels I was looking at (Shangri-La, Regis Royal Meridian, Eton, Weston) (just over $300 USD for 3 nights including breakfast) with no sacrifice for star class or location. I was actually in the process of booking the Weston when i found this deal. I was familiar with the Swissotel chain, having stayed there in Atlanta, so I jumped on it. This is a new hotel and I found the staff very attentive to our request and the hotel actually exceeded my expectations. Service was excellent, exactly what I would expect at a 5 star. I used the concierge frequently and was happy to report no problems, while i was checking in I had him book me reservations at Jean Georges which was completed before the front desk actually had a room assigned. My wife was very happy with the Chocolate Buffet and the breakfast buffet was good. I will say that of the 3 mornings we were there the breakfast buffet got worse each day. Friday was amazing, Saturday was good and I was dissapointed with Sunday but they might have been saving the big guns for the brunch which we didn't get to taste. The pool was nice as was the steam room and sauna, which was a nice way to relax before our long haul flight back to the US. The room was ultra modern (which i liked but others may have an issue with). The bathroom was lovely, marble especially the shower with the hand held and rain shower heads. As stated before the tub was too small for my large 6'3&quot; frame but its nice to have the option, we used it to dry our swim suits. I was have to agree with a prior review that the glazed glass facing the bed room was not the best design and can disturb someone sleeping if you have to get up in the night to use the restroom, the also have speaker in the bathroom with volume control so you can hear the TV, interesting to say the least. But those are minor. TV was nice large LCD, no HD channels though, which I thought was funny to have such a nice TV and no HD options but that may be China's fault. The location is central and while not walking distance from any one attraction it is central to many and with the average cab ride under $7 to get just about anywhere but the airport (airport was $15 for a 45 min ride). The business cards for the hotel had the address and &quot;Please take me to the Swissotel at the corner of...&quot; written on the back in Chinese which was very helpful. On my next trip to Shanghai I'll be looking at this hotel first instead of last as the combination of price, location, and service can't be beat. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"This is a solid 5 star hotel After staying at several 5 star hotels in our recent trip to China, my husband and I agreed that the 7 month old Swissotel Grand in Shanghai was the most outstanding. The location was perfect, within walking distance to shopping and restaurants. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the presentation simply beautiful. What made our stay better than other hotels was the attention to detail by the staff. One of the managers was from the U.S.A and really understood our requests, whereas the staff in other fine hotels just politely listened and nodded, not really understanding our questions. This hotel knows the meaning of customer service. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Form Over Function Found a great rate with breakfast for the National Holiday on Swissotel's website where not only was it not possible to book it but there was no phone number anywhere to call in the reservation ! We got it on Expedia and 4 of us spent 4 nights in 2 rooms and were overall very pleased.Beautiful contemporary design with soothing light earth tones throughout. Function takes a back seat to Design here though: -A nice oval desk is fixed sticking at an angle away from a built in credenza just like I thought I would , I walked into it in the middle of the night..... twice. Ouch. -There's only one electricity socket at the desk and virtually no other to be found. For a business hotel? Come on! -Other than the small drawer in each night stand, there was one large drawer for each bed, built in to the foot of the bed. Not convenient if you are older. The small drawer at the bottom of the closet was blocked by the sliding glass closet doors; unuseable!-With a large peek-a-boo glass panel between bath and bed rooms an OPAQUE shade would have been nice instead of the translucent &quot;modesty&quot; shade. So if you use the bathroom at night you are illuminating the sleeping area for your room mate!-Multiple light switches weren't redundant. From the left of the left bed you could turn on/off the do not disturb feature and one room light but the other entry and main lights were operable from the right side of the right bed, where there were switches for the nice designer recessed and night lights. The small halogen reading spot lights are great though!-The bathroom was very well lit with two switches but the onyx which was illuminated under sink was barely evident. Nice design idea though! No counterspace....a couple of shelves below and a drawer for all your toiletries!--There is a glass-over-water walkway to enter the restaurant in the lobby but they had to cover the big rivets running down the middle with yellow safety tape, almost certainly because people were catching the soles of their shoes on them and tripping! How about little plants instead !!!!-My other two gripes: -Twice I had to suggest to the staff at breakfast that, at least (and I love it otherwise) I didn't want to hear and compete with high energy techno music at 730 AM during breakfast !-Internet is $17 a day ..... a small perk they could extend to SwissGold members at least!Despite all this, I REALLY LIKED THE HOTEL !-Though English wasn't perfect the front desk staff was young and attentive. They have bar style stools so you can sit to check in and out. Conceirge was very good. Housekeeping was efficiently invisible, spotless ,excellent ....with turndown.-Breakfast selection was extensive, attractive and very enjoyable.-Roomy bathroom. Tub smallish but shower roomy. They replaced the used bathrobe daily ! Good amenities. -Firm but comfortable beds with a foam and a down pillow and delicious duvets/ linens which were changed daily (Is Swissotel the only chain that doesn't put out those little cards about saving the environment ????)-Good location 1 block from main subway line. Walkable to French concession, numerous restaurants and a couple of malls.-Nice pool (you need a swim cap), gym, and classy looking mens spa area: steam room and sauna (though one day one of them didn't seem to be on), a cold plunge pool, a not-hot-enough multiperson jacuzzi with two nice individual jetted tubs, good showers.My overall experience was great so I will overlook the kooky little design (and web site) flaws. With a Shangri-La about to go up catty corner and several other upscale hotels nearby, hopefully competition will keep this as such good value for the money! "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Very good option in Shanghai I stayed at the Swissotel Grand for the second time and for ten nights.As others have rightly pointed out, the position is very good and the introductory price very appealing. My experience was good: nice, new rooms with cool design. The fitness centre and the newly opened spa and pool are spotlessy clean and functional wit state-of-the-art equipment. The food could be better, but this is probably going to improve when the new restaurants will be open.I was actually quite impressed by the service. I arrived at check in at 08:00am and they didn't have a king bedroom available, only twin. When I pointed out that having a king bed was important for me, they had the hotel staff converting my room in a king one in five minutes!!! Now, this is service!I will definitely go back. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Very nice. New hotel, only recently opened. Good location, close to shopping areas. Room was pleasant to stay in, and package included breakfast and free broadband.Overall, a pleasant stay. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Disappointed... Well, well, well. I haven't tried other hotels in SH so it will not be fair to compare. However, I somehow regret not booking another 5-star hotel which I could have given the same price we paid. The hotel is located a little away from the downtown area of SH. But then, SH is so small so it doesn't make much difference to me. In this sense, I quite like the neighbourhood as it is more of a residential area, and certainly less &quot;tourisy&quot;. The mall next to the hotel seems to be quite high-end and the super market located in the basement of the mall was great. In terms of the room, it's okay but not amazing. It just didn't give me that &quot;WOW&quot; effect (unlike another 5-star hotel I stayed at in BJ). Actually, upon checking in, I asked if it would be possible for us to upgrade to a bigger room (just out of curiosity...since my friend needed to prepare for an exam). The frontdesk lady looked at us weirdly and asked &quot;do you REALLY need an upgrade?&quot; Well, I was thinking, isn't it MY decision as I am the one paying? Why question me like that?! The bathroom was alright...just like most ppl have said in their previous posts so I won't repeat. The tub was not appealing at all...just too small to even fit one person.We were fortunate as we didn't have problem with our air-con system. My friend did complain that the bed was a little too hard. Oh~ and a little side story to explain how ridiculous their business centre is. Our mobile got stolen on the last day while we toured the city. We wanted to make a call home when we got back to the hotel but since we have already checked out that morning, we asked the front desk if we could place a call through them and pay for it. We were directed to the business centre on the 2/F and was told that the phones at business centre cannot place international calls!!!! What kind of business centre is this???? We were then RE-directed back to the frontdesk...who then tried to redirect us back to the business centre until I made a fuss! We were eventually shown a pay phone somewhere at some corner of the hotel!!! Boohoo... so again, I agree that this hotel is NO way compatible with a 5-star rating...I happened to visit the Shangri-la during my stay and man, the SH one just can't go wrong...it definitely won't let you down despite my terrible experience with the BJ one. In short, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. I probably wouldn't have booked it if I knew. I am not that bitter since we got a very good deal as we were offered the trial package. I suppose I wouldn't have picked this hotel if it wasn't a new hotel. It just doesn't impress! "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Did not enjoy our stay Shanghai – Swissotel ReviewIt is really difficult to know where to begin with how terribly bad a hotel this is but having stayed there for a week I think our opinions can be relied upon;Temperature – You can control the temperature in your room if you can figure how the very difficult air con controls but as for the rest of the hotel it’s like being in a freezer. The air-conditioning is so cold that you need to put a sweater on if you go down for a drink or some food in the buffet or bar. Everyone we spoke to said the same and many people came down with colds as the contrast between the hotel temperature and the outside is so great.Business Suite – Apparently we were staying in the business suite which is ridiculously small and certainly not a suite when compared to the standards of other 5* hotels. It felt small and the desk space was very small. In addition to this the internet hardly ever worked.Internet – After two days of complaining the IT person at the hotel finally said they could increase the speed in our room, goodness knows why they didn’t do this in the first place. As we were there to attend a conference we were there on business but were hardly able to get any done.Bathroom – The bathroom has a sliding door and a big pane of glass. This means if you are sharing or have a guest not only can you see them use the toilet but because the door doesn’t seal properly you can hear them as well! Not a pleasant experience and when we described this to the hotel manager his response was just as ridiculous, first he said it was modern design. Modern design is all well and good but not if it doesn’t meet the requirements and tastes of the majority of you guests. Next the manager said “But this is China” to which we said that we live in China an the only place you can see and hear people going to the loo is in public toilets not something you’d expect in a 5* hotel.Shower – If you take a shower in this hotel, despite reading my review and my advice to go somewhere else then make sure you put the towel down in front of the door as the seals on the doors don’t work and otherwise you will have a flood in the bathroom. One of our colleagues also said that the light in his shower was hanging down with exposed wires, very dangerous.Food – The buffet has good food and is nice when it’s not being frozen by the surrounding air temperature but it’s far too expensive and you’d be much better by either catching a taxi and back to Pudong and eating somewhere with a view or eating somewhere local in the areas around the hotel where the people are friendly. I except that it’s a new hotel but since we have lived in China we have eaten at many new restaurants and never encountered the incapabilities of the waiting staff as at this hotel. It’s usually simple things which make waitresses/waitors make the difference, the staff here often took your plate away before you’d finished your meal and were actually eating and they never came round to offer drinks throughout the meal, you had to catch their attention and as there were so few of them this was difficult.Smell – Having stayed there for a week and the hotel being so new (6 weeks) we were unfortunately the test subjects for the most horrendous smell of man made chemicals that were coming from the paint, the varnish the glues to stick everything together. When we returned everything in our suitcases needed to be washed as it smelt of chemicals and also during our time there we suffered terrible headaches which must have been caused by these new made substances. The headaches disappeared when we returned home.Changing Rooms – We were unlucky enough to stay on a side of the hotel near a large shopping centre which decided to change the air-con system on their roof at 5am in the morning. Whilst this kind of construction work 24 hours a day is expected in China normally hotels make arrangements for this kind of work to either start at a more reasonable hour or fit really well sealed windows. In our case this hotel didn’t, so it felt like someone was hammering at a piece of metal in our room. Subsequently the reception staffs were helpful and arranged for us to move rooms to the other side of the hotel; this was successful in that it was quieter. However we were informed when we checked out, that we had that night free and indeed it wasn’t on the bill. We assumed this was because of the night we had to change rooms as it was that night which was not on the bill. However, subsequently the hotels finance department has receded on this offer saying there has been a mistake and they have emailed to say they have taken the money for the night we had been told was free. They still haven’t responded to my email to the hotel manager to correct this which is basically the best example of how terrible this place was in terms of quality and service. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Good... but far away from excellent Overall the hotel is good located and near to to the subway (Line 2, Jing' an temple station) and of course embedded in an nice area: very central but far away from the tourist masses at the Bund.As you can read in the other reviews the issue is that the hotel is currently not finished (May 2008): the pool is not open, unfortunately the whole staff is not enough trained for a five star hotel and with respect to the closed shops and restaurants the whole athmosphere is sometimes a little bit lifeless.Anyway, I've never worked for an hotel - maybe this could be &quot;normal&quot; for the first days of a new Hotel- life in Shanghai?! And of course, they offered us attractive low rates for a five star, so overall we had an attractive stay! "
swissotel grand shanghai ,Fantastic Stay We just stayed at the Swissotel Grand Shanghai and it was great. The Hotel Staff is great and very forthcoming. The rooms are very nice decorated and spacious. Location is great just on top of Subway station and next to a great shopping mall with all major brands. Would stay here anytime again as it is fantastic value for money. 
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Needs a lot of work This is a hotel where the location is excellent, but the hotel itself is unfinished and the staff need a great deal of training.Unlike their website, the hotel is NOT YET FINISHED. Large facilities, such as the pool, the spa, and most of the restaurants are not yet open and will not be for several weeks at least.However the rates are good, and the location excellent - from Pudong airport via Maglev and metro to Jing'an temple took less than 1 hour or so. It is less than 5 mins from the metro entrance.However the internet is appallingly slow, the rooms are already falling apart in parts and the staff know little or nothing, although they are eager (perhaps too eager) too please.If you want a cheap hotel in Shanghai with comfortable beds, hot water, and a short walk to the metro, then take it. However if you need service, internet that works, a sink that drains, a breakfast where the juice isn't diluted and where the girl can't make you pineapple juice because she doesn't know how to slice it ... then fine.The hotel has only opened the gym and not yet even the changing rooms. However they will give you a voucher for the Hilton spa and gym and arrange a car to take you for free - although it is less than 10 minutes away - and the facilities there are superb. "
swissotel grand shanghai ,"Rather a 4star hotel We just returned from a one week stay at the newly openened Swissotel Grand in Shanghai. Overall I can recommend the hotel, we got a pretty good rate for this 5 star hotel. Although, I would have expected more for a hotel this range.Pros: Convenient location close to the metro line 2, close to French connection, nice and modern rooms, lovely bathroom with tub and shower, nice view, excellent breakfastCons: spa and fitness area still under construction, use of business center is NOT free!!!, and the worst we had to complain about is service, service and service. It looks like they want to be a five star hotel, but in fact they don't deserve more than 4 stars.Especially during breakfast, the service was not good at all. You had to ask three times to get the juice or the waffles you ordered. Sometimes the staff brought it to your table but most of the time you had to get up yourself and get it. Lucky you, if they had it ready by then. Also upon checkout, we discovered it not be that easy! The whole checkout procedure took us 35 minutes because they presented us a wrong bill which was 3000 RNB over the amount we booked!! We presented them our reservation but they told us they had higher rates from Monday to Thursday. Four people finally worked on our problem behind the reception without being able to solve it. Finally, we had the manager call in and we ended up paying exactly what we booked. When we signed the bill then, the lady behind the reception told us she forget 6 RNB to charge to the bill. I don't know what to say to this after such a checkout hassle. This hotel does NOT deserve the five stars! Before the call themselves a five star hotel, they have to hire five star staff. "

the bund hotel ,"good value and location This is definitely not to be compared to international chains but the hotel is clean, efficient, and staff is very helpful. Just not used to having people smoke all around you and having 3 dedicated non smoking floors where people still smoke in the hallways...Location, quite convenient to walk 5 mins to the shopping street. If you are a single male, BE PREPARED to be solicited once you walk off the front drop off for massage by a bunch of men. Just keep walking and they get the drift.The room is smaller but then, just for sleeping and cleansing right? The washroom took up 50% of the entire room, with a separate shower and tub.I only stayed 1 night and it was acceptable but if I had to stay longer, i may have some issues with the cleanliness as I found many condom wrappers between the bed and night table and I was not looking! If you are travelling with a family, I would highly recommend a quick once over to make sure the room is G rated and the kids will not ask you why there is an end of a ketchup packet beside the bed. "
the bund hotel ,"OK but bed is hard and avoid the Chinese restaurant The room is acceptable and the bathroom is nice. However the bed is so hard, I got some back pain. What really annoyed me is the cashier from the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor, I think. It was my last night so I have only dollars with me and a credit card. All the places we went accepted credit cards so it was a big surprised when they will not accept it. So I told them that I will go down to the lobby and offered a hundred dollar bill as a security in case I do not come back. My dinner was less than $50 so I was annoyed when the cashier looked at me as if I am a thief and refused. She ordered her staff to accompanied me down the the lobby and the staff apologized to me at the elevator. I have never been treated in such a horrible way and I was so angry at the stupidity of the cashier. For this reason, I will not go back to the hotel even if it is free. Her ignorance and cluelessness is beyond my comprehension. "
the bund hotel ,"Good but not great The counter/bell/concierge service is decent, presumably due to the business clientele the hotel may be targeting. Airport transfers are somewhat expensive - avoid if you have the time to book or take public transportation. The single rooms are standard furnished but very small. The twin/double rooms are a reasonable size. In-room, wired internet access is available but chargeable. Breakfast is poor in terms of selection and quality - try the cafes and eateries in the neighborhood for better value and for an orientation of the area at the same time. In the vicinity: a mix of commercial/office buildings with accompanying banks/post offices/similar amenities. The location and the major roads servicing the area mean several visitor destinations are an affordable cab ride away. People's Square and Nanjing East Rd (shopping district/pedestrian mall) are less than 10min away by foot, with convenience stores and local sundry shops and eateries along the route. The Bund is a 15min walk away but unfortunately there were road/construction works, maybe for the expo coming up. Overall while the hotel is above par, the rates could be considered high and again this could be indicative of the segment targeted. "
the bund hotel ,"Good facilities so-so staff some annoyances... This hotel has a lot going for it, but just isn't quite managed right. The front desk staff spoke limited English and were none too friendly or accomodating. During check-in, the bellhops did not offer to help with our many bags. The concierge was great. Most annoying...expensive Internet, expensive coffee and no breakfast included. I also lost some items that I purchased...not sure if it was the hotel, but the other review about theft may be on the mark. I wish I would have spent another $20 or $25 a night and stayed at the JW Marriott (check travelocity). Location is good, but there are closer hotels to Nanking Road. "
the bund hotel ,"Great value good location but no black teabags! We are just back from a 3 night stay at this good 4 star hotel in a convenient location, a couple of blocks from East Nanjing Road and maybe 4 blocks from The Bund. For Aussies who like to eat at M on The Bund it's just a straight walk down Guangdong Lu to get there.Our non smoking room on the 16th floor was quite big with a massive bathroom. It was clean with good airconditioning and typically for China hard beds.As a non coffee drinker I was dismayed to find only coffee sachets provided to make a hot drink.House keeping could not provide any black teabags and room service did deliver one to my room. On requesting another teabag the next day I was told I would have to pay for it. I offered to exchange the coffee for a teabag but no go. Green teabags were not provided either.A small frustration in what was a good value hotel. I'm sure we were the only people on the 16th floor, business seemed incredibly quiet. We paid $A305 for the 3 nights. A special deal was offered via Expedia. We did not try the restaurants in the hotel. But we loved the Paris Baguette shop across the road. "
the bund hotel ,"Excellent Value I stayed here for 10 nights in June. Only 3 floors are non-smoking. I had booked a non-smoking room on the executive floor, which, I found out when I arrived, doesn't exist. I was immediately offered an upgrade to a suite on a non-smoking floor, with complementary internet access. A steal at $80 a night. Staff, particularly the Concierge desk, was very helpful. Breakfast buffet was not great, but filling and reasonably priced. Other great choices within easy walking distance. I didn't try the other hotel restaurants. Terrific location in an old-school neighborhood. Easy to walk everywhere. The room and bathroom were very decent: quiet, clean, spacious, modern. The bed was very hard, but fine. I'd absolutely stay here again. "
the bund hotel ,"Enjoyed our stay We stayed at the Bund in Shanghai on May 6th-7th and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We are a family with three kids (12. 9, and 8 years old). We arrived at the Bund very late at night as it was our first night in China. We had lots of questions for the employees in the lobby, and they were very helpful. The next morning we were leaving very early to catch a train to a nearby city. They made sure we made it to the correct train station and delivered a box breakfast to our room before we left. They went out of their way to help us. Housekeeping is incredible! We needed extra towels and ice, and it all was delivered promptly. The hotel is tucked away in a neighborhood but is only a 5 minute walk to Nanjing Road, a very nice pedistrian shopping area and a 10 minute walk to The Bund Pedestrian Walkway along the river. We enjoyed observing life in a Chinese neighborhood. There is also a French bakery (with free internet) and a convienent store around the corner. The room and the bathroom had plenty of space. There are two large twin beds in each room. We paid for a roll-a-way to be brought in.On the second morning of our stay, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which included Asian and Western food items.. Everything was delicious! Check-out time is 12 noon, but they let us check out at 2 p.m. without charge. We were leaving on a sleeper train to Beijing at 9:40 p.m. and they held our bags and backpacks until that evening while we shopped and ate.We would definitely stay here again. "
the bund hotel ,"Great location great value: $54 per night for four star hotel The Bund hotel in Shanghai is not on the Bund and is not to be confused with the Hyatt-on-the-Bund Hotel.The Bund Hotel is a modern four star hotel ideally located in the center of central (Huangpu area) Shanghai. The East Nanjing Road pedestrian zone (and metro stop) is a 10 minute walk north; the People’s (Renmin) Park (and major museums and metro stop) is a 10 minute walk west; the Bund waterfront is a 20 minute walk east; Yuyuan gardens (and old town tourist zone) is a 25 minute walk southeast.Unlike the new hotels in the Pudong area, which are elegant but located in an isolated tourist wasteland, the Bund hotel is on (relatively) quiet Guangdong Road in a low rise area full of small shops and local color, within reasonable walking distance of many tourist sights.The Bund hotel rooms are very nicely decorated, with rosewood paneling and furnishings. Beds are extra firm, and bed linens are excellent. My corner room had wrap around balcony windows with views in three compass directions, like the bridge of a ship. Rooms have the usual four star amenities. The only disappointment is that my TV did not work (static only) and there is no newspaper service (English language papers are available to be read in the hotel business center). Free bottled water is provided in the marble and granite bathroom, and a teapot is provided to boil water. The mini-bar and internet hook-up have the usual charges.The front desk staff is efficient, and the concierge staff is friendly and eager to please. A western style breakfast buffet is available for about $12 if it is not included in your room rate. I did not try this or any of the hotel restaurants. There are other options nearby, including a French bakery with tables and (I believe) free wi-fi half a block north of the hotel (the hotel charges $1.50 per quarter hour to use their business center internet laptop). A large modern supermarket is one block west and north of the hotel, and several mini-markets are even closer. The best part of my 6 night stay at the Bund Hotel was the price -- $54 plus tax per night for a superior single (actually a twin bed double) room booked through Travelocity. I usually bid for international hotels on the web, but this price was too good to pass up, especially since the location is ideal.Reserving hotels in China can be problematic, since location is very important -- some hotels are quite isolated and some are not in the location their names suggest. Also, non-smoking rooms can be difficult to obtain (the Bund Hotel has only 3 non-smoking of 22 floors, and the Travelocity operator even called the hotel for me to guarantee that I got one). Also, even the better hotels in China may have advertised base rates for rooms that can be tiny and even windowless, so I chose a superior rather than standard single for only $6 more than the $48 base rate. My superior single was twice the size of a standard single (320 vs. 160 square feet according to the internet description).To find the Bund Hotel from the Pudong (PVG) airport take the Maglev bullet train ($6) to the Longyang Road metro station, then line 2 (60 cents) to the East Nanjing Road station. Exit the metro station onto the pedestrian street and walk several blocks west to the Sofitel Hotel, then turn south (on Fujian Road) several blocks to Guangdong Road. The Bund Hotel is then one block west (not visible until you approach it). It is a 10 minute walk. Watch for turning traffic whenever crossing at an intersection. Street names are well marked with in English and Chinese. A taxi from the airport takes about an hour. I hope you enjoy Shanghai and the Bund Hotel as much as I did. Happy and safe travel! "
the bund hotel ,"Okay hotel but I wouldn't go back. I booked this hotel directly. This hotel isn’t as nice as the Park Plaza in Beijing and the beds were horribly hard. Our room (#1607) had city views but from the backside. We could see the nearby freeway. The room had two double beds and a very nice large bathroom. The employees were not friendly at all with the exception of William at the concierge desk, who helped us obtain our train tickets for Hangzhou. The location was great, about a 15-minute walk to the Nanjing pedestrian street. I especially loved the area around our street, as it was quite colorful with street food vendors and small shops. A grocery store is nearby, as well as a pastry/bakery. I wouldn't stay here again unless I got a great price. "
the bund hotel ,"Good 4* Hotel in downtown shanghai Booked this hotel w/ Ctrip once I arrived at HongQiao airport. Got to the hotel at 930am didn't let us check in until 11am which was ok, just walked around until 11am. Taxi from airport was 55RMB, in rush hr traffic, what a steal.Hotel located close to bund and Nanjing Road. Probably about 5-10 mins to Nanjing and 15 to the Bund Walking. Near the highway too so easy to get to from HongQiao and elsewhere.It's on a relatively quiet corner in Shanghai, Fukien Lu and Guangdong Lu. But still close to the action. The room was clean and large. Had a corner room w/ two twin beds (but seems like oversized twins.) Had a computer in the room too which was great! Free internet usage. Usual chinese amenities, toothbrushes, slippers, robes. Bathroom had a separate tub and shower which was nice. Housekeeping did an OK job, nothing to write home about. I don't think they changed the sheets/pillowcases but I only stayed two nights so I didn't care. Staff had decent english for China so that was a plus and they were friendly. "
the bund hotel ,"great accommodation - great value in Shanghai Our stay at the Bund was terrific and I'm surprised by some of the comments on Tripadvisior. The rooms are modern, spacious and spotless. Whereas the staff were modern and spotless. There are no language problems and everyone seemed committed to making our stay as pleasant as possible. Also the hotel's location (some 800 mertres from the actual Bund) is superb for visitors. And finally, while the Bund Hotel is not the most flashy in town, it represents outstanding value for money. "
the bund hotel ,"Thiefs work at this hotel I left my computer in a room here, and it was missing when I returned. The managers told me I must have misplaced it, but I am 100 percent positive it was left on the bed. They said they would look at the surrveilance tapes and see if anyone entered the room. They said they could only see the maid, but did not see her take my computer. They refused to show me the video tapes, and would not help me with filing a police report. Needless to say, DO NOT STAY here unless you want your things to be stolen from your room. "
the bund hotel ,"Okaish hotel in a good location We stayed in the bund before heading to south china and despite what have read here we found it o.k the rooms can vary from size but this is due to the floor plan of the hotel, the staff is happy to change rooms. They do the usual tricks at check in with one breakfast for a double and such, be prepared to haggle a bit. Chinese hotels are loud, thats the way they are - if you do not like it go to some international chain half the fun double the price. Breakfast is to be avoided ,if you can rather choose a better rate, and head to the Paris Croque shop on the other side of the street "
the bund hotel ,"Pass. Don't stay here as a business hotel. While this place is nice on the inside and the staff kind, it's not by any stretch a four-star business hotel. The rooms were loud, including the crappy floor that groaned with every step. Room wasn't bad for me and a buddy, though. Just, not worth the money. It was nice, though, to have a PC live to the internet in the room. I liked that, and to my knowledge I never had to pay for it.Best part of the stay was when a bellhop interpreted for me to my cab driver that I was only going to pay half of what he wanted to charge me. He was trying his best to scam me, and while I couldn't speak Mandarin, the bellhop interpreted for me that he wasn't getting the money he wanted out of me. The bellhop thought it was funny. He did his best to be very professional, though, and not laugh and the scamming cabbie and simply interpret. By the way, only use cabbies in the official cab area of Shanghai airports. Everyone else is basically a scam. There is a reason I'll never stay here again, though. My clothes were on the bathroom floor while I was showering. I didn't know it at the time but the shower leaked as fast as I could lather up me head. My clothes for the day were soaked. Not a little wet, they were freaking SOAKED!! So, I had to find another outfit to wear for the day. This was near the end of my vacation to China and I had already shipped some dirty clothes back to the States to make room for souvenirs, etc. I did have clothes, but wanted my now completely wet clothes, of course, cleaned and dried. (Or at least dry.) The bathroom floor flooded every time we showered. We had to get extra towels and basically build a small wall and take short showers. I asked multiple people around the hotel to waive the drycleaning charges. No one would. It was 100% the hotel's fault that the bathroom flooded and that my clothes had to be laundered, but that didn't matter to any 'manager' I spoke with at the hotel. This was a joke. No one would waive my laundry charges and no one even offered to change our rooms. Business hotel? They won't have any of my business. "
the bund hotel ,"Average at best The Bund Hotel is a hotel with significant aspirations...looking at it from the outside it looks a contender for a 4+ star hotel at least but as we all know don't judge a book by it's cover.We probably didn't arrive at this hotel in ideal condition, sweaty and smelly off the train from the 10+ hour journey from HK...but still something about this hotel when i walked in said it looks good but is there some problems behind the scenes...The foyer/restaurant area is particularly grand when you walk in and trys to impress on the same level as the Royal Park in HK but somehow fails...i don't know how to describe it but it appears now as if they maybe were trying too hard with too much gold etc. making the place look tacky as the days went by in our weeks stay in the hotel.The two best things about this hotel are the Room and the location. The room was particularly good as it was almost double/triple the size of the room in HK although granted it didn't have the same level of amenities with no LCD TV, no spacious bathroom/shower area etc. and the TV was in a cupboard (which is one of my pet hates)...but apart from that the room was superb.The next best thing was the location as it was literally a short stroll to the Bund and the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel which is a good way of getting across to Pudong.The worst things about this hotel and what keeps it from even getting three stars is the quality of the restaurants, the quality of the breakfast , the cleanliness of the hotel overall and the attentiveness of the staff. The restaurants in the hotel aren't amazing you've got the European option that does Pizzas, pastas, steak, burgers etc. the Chinese restaurant which was actually pretty good but the interior needs a good refurbishment as this looked a bit run down also, and then you've got the Russian restaurant which to be perfectly honest we didn't fancy at all.Breakfast wasn't too bad but just felt a bit &quot;meh&quot; after the fantastic breakfast buffet in the Royal Park in HK. Cleanliness is not a high priority as the hallways and corridoors which lead to the rooms aren't kept in tip-top condition atall...they're quite dirty with dust/cobwebs on lights and ground in dirt on the faded carpets. The staff just top this hotel off as they weren't very attentive atall and tended to just chat to each other whilst we were waiting to be served our food/tea/coffee etc. at breakfast or for Lunch/Dinner.To Summarise the Bund Hotel could be an excellent hotel if it just cleaned up its act a little, with a refurbishment and a little extra staff training...investing in some better restaurants and slightly better amenities but at the moment unfortunately this holds the hotel back from being average. On our Month holiday in China this was the worst hotel we stayed at (eclipsed even by the New World Xi'an at £30 a night!) "
the bund hotel ,"Small but Nice Just came back from China. Stayed at The Bund Hotel for 4 nights. Location of hotel is great, walking distance to Nanjing Rd, People square &amp; even Xantiandi. We were upgraded to an excutive room, nice decor. The surrounding of the hotel is quite run down but it actually is quite charming. You can see some really interesting aspects of life of the Shanghainese. Only thing is not a lot of people working there speak English. The front deck &amp; the concierge are good though. "
the bund hotel ,"Not again Have stayed twice in November for business. First time in a standard room, last time in an executive room. Still can't understand why I paid more for a smaller room!Breakfast is better and more options in the main restaurant, the &quot;Executive&quot; benefits are a joke. Housekeeping leaves alot to be desired, did not replace coffee sugar for 2 days. Had to keep phoning for the little extras that make life bearable away from home.I would not stay here again. "
the bund hotel ,"Noisy and rude I thought the room looked nice; quite spacious, fairly new, big tub, good view from a massive window. And the location was pretty good for tourist purposes, despite not actually being anywhere near the Bund at all. This concludes anything positive I have to say about the place.I completely agree with a previous poster that this hotel is a bad choice if you want to get any sleep. The bed was not comfortable. The heating didn't work, although you could control how hard you wanted cold air blasted at you. The walls appeared to conduct sound rather than insulate against it. And there seemed to be a lot of sound: from other bathrooms, other guests coming back late and having a shout in the hallways, cleaning staff shouting at each other first thing in the morning, etc. On top of that, I found the staff to be cold and brusque and completely unsympathetic to complaints. This hotel did not contribute positively to my Shanghai visit and I left feeling tired and frustrated. Maybe I was just unlucky this time but I wouldn't risk it again, and wouldn't recommend anyone else risk it either. I hesitate slightly to say so, but I think perhaps a hotel with western management would be a better choice. "
the bund hotel ,"Terrible if you want to sleep Positive reviews by other travelers may be justified in some respects.In my case, the experience has been terrible. On my floor, I had during several nights groups of Chinese laughing, shouting, meeting around the elevators until 2 or 3 am. The last 2 nights, I had only 3 or 4 hours of sleep.If you do not consider that the central point to be judged for a hotel is the quality of calm and sleep you get, you may enjoy other points mentioned in the reviews.Good luck "
the bund hotel ,"Bad service dirty decent location Location was close to major attractions but immediate surroundings old and dirty. Front desk unpleasant., unhelpful, and plain rude. Concierge friendly but a little too greedy--tried to be helpful only with a fee attached. Bathroom dirty. Overall, would not stay again or recommend unless one is desperate for a reasonably low price in Shanghai during peak season. Would recommend paying a little more and staying at a slightly farther foreign-/American-based chain like Holiday Inn rather than Chinese-owned one. "
the bund hotel ,"Dont get too excited with an upgrade Location of the hotel is very convenient - easy walking distance to The Bund and Nanking Road. Hotel is a bit dated in decor. Staff are generally friendly and speak good English, especially the Concierge staff who are also very helpful.If you ever get upgraded to an Executive Room like we did, dont get too excited as it is not as glorious as it may sound. It simply means you'll get : - exclusive checkin on Level 22 (instead of ground floor) ;- free access to internet service (not free internet access). They have a PC you can use on L22 but you'll need to pay 40 Yuan for 1 hr of interneT access or 80 Yuan for 24hrs.;- breakfast on Level 22 (instead of Level 2 with the masses). However, food selection on Level 22 is so very limited. One is better off having breakfast on L2 with the masses. There is no difference in the level of service here. - free happy hour around 6pm (not sure what drinks they serve as we were never back in time to try)We found a bit of toe nail on the carpet in our room when we first checked in. This was an Executive room! "
the bund hotel ,"Ruined by noise and rude staff The Bund is overall a fairly nice hotel, but thanks to the service I really do regret staying there. The rooms are quite attractive for the price - I for one don't really mind hard beds. They seem to have cut a few corners (e.g. air con, tv and shower all a bit unreliable) but the view was great and the location not bad at all. However, when we turned up the staff on front desk barely looked at us, and didn't smile at all. Didn't think much of it at the time, but on the second day we were woken very early in the morning by shouting. This carried on for about an hour until there was no point trying to sleep any more, and I got up, exhausted. Went downstairs to complain (very politely), and had to try really hard just to get the guy at reception to look at me, which he did with a mixture of boredom and hostility. Told him about the noise, and he just carried on staring at me, then said &quot;Well what do you want me to do about it?&quot;. Was so stunned that I muttered something about thinking he might want to know, before the person next to me lost patience and snapped &quot;maybe you could ask them to stop!!!&quot;. To which reception guy gave sarcastic laugh and said &quot;OK&quot; (i.e. &quot;whatever, go away&quot;). I've stayed in a number of hotels in China, so I don't expect too much; I don't need the kind of grovelling customer service that is now considered necessary in much of the west. But I do think, at a basic, that a hotel should have an interest in providing somewhere that people can actually sleep, and in speaking to them like respected human beings. The Bund failed to come close in either of these regards. I was only in Shanghai for a couple of days, and was totally sleep deprived for one of them. I guess there was some back luck involved - maybe the staff don't shout at each other every morning - but if you care about getting some sleep than I'd say definitely go elsewhere. The Bund hotel needs to replace or retrain it's front desk very quickly (and some soundproofing would be good as well). Otherwise I hope they go bust. "
the bund hotel ,"A1 location Stayed for 4 nights.Paid a little bit extra (but well worth it) for a executive room which are located on the top 2 floors of the hotel. Staying in a executive room you had exclusive check-in on level 22 rather than reception on ground.Free internet usage and the best bit was happy hour every night between 6:30pm and 8pm on level 22 which was free drinks. The bed was very comfortable, the bedroom and bathroom were quite big and both very clean.The staff spoke very good english and were very helpful.The location is great, 20min walk to the bund, 15min walk to subway (Nanjing East station) 10 min walk to Nanjing st.Would stay here again, really enjoyed it. "
the bund hotel ,"Great location OK quality The Bund Hotel is well located within walking distance of the Bund, Nanking Road etc. The room was more spacious than others we had in China which was useful as we had our daughter with us and required an extra bed. The bathroom was enormous. Furnishing was OK, beds are hard as they are all over China. A good value for money hotel without being great. "
the bund hotel ,"Good Tourist Hotel We stayed at the Hotel on the seventh floor for 8 nights in October. We found the hotel to be well situated with The Bund, Peoples Square and shopping with 10 to 15 minutes walk of the hotel. The hotel was quite, service reasonable and the concierge extremely helpful with directions and tourist information. Pitfalls, beds were harder than most in places we have stayed in China. Buffet breakfast was satisfactory, drinks in the hotel bar were expensive. An average of 10 dollars Australian for a glass of beer or spirits. The security in the hotel was good "
the bund hotel ,"functional adequate hotel This hotel was fine. Nothing was great, nothing was horrible. Nearest subway was about 6 blocks away. The bund itself was about 10 blocks away. Breakfast was mediocre. Coffee was not great and hard to get. The omelet guy was pretty good. There was a large selection of mediocre food.Room was spacious. Room had 180 degree view, on the 16th floor. Nice to just look out the window at the city below. Of course there were plenty of much taller buildings in this city. The bed was extremely hard, and I prefer a firm bed. TV remote was missing, but I never bothered to complain. room safe was provided. bathroom was fine, not too small.Concierge was great. They really tried to helped me find a method to get some laundry done... All round, the hotel was fine. "
the bund hotel ,"Good location good value The Bund is in a great location for walking to the Bund (10 minutes), the Yu Gardens and Nanjing Rd. The immediately surrounding streets are slightly down-at-heel but nothing sinister. Good value for money, clean well-appointed room (go for a Deluxe to be above the noise). Definitely not a 5-star in that lobby was slighly worn and air-conditioning not fabulous, but it was fine and we'd stay there again. Staff (contrary to other reports) were very helpful including booking theater tickets and writing place names etc down in Chinese. Restaurant was appalling and only went there once in an emergency! French-style bakery was useful. Get the name of the hotel in chinese characters for taxi from airport. The Westin just up the road has a great breakfast - expensive but worth it for a splurge! "
the bund hotel ,Good hotel in Shanghai NB: This isn't actually on the BundBut the hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to the Nanjing Road and Bund. Lots of stuff to do close-by.The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was fine 
the bund hotel ,"Great Location and great price Paid $120NZ (cheap off expedia) to stay here a night and was definitely worth it. Was half way between the Bund, museum and the main shopping st Nanjing St. Was a nice hotel, very clean and large room. Only problem we had was that just outside the bathroom there was a water leak that was making a wet patch on the floor. We had no problems checking in, although they did make us wait till the require 12pm time to check in, but we just stored our luggage and took off for the shops.Cost us 150yen from the airport to get too.Would recommend staying here for a 4 star place. "
the bund hotel ,"Recommeded to all Stayed here for 4 nights last month and would definately recommend it to others. We paid a little extra to upgrade to the executive level which was worth it if just for the free internet access in the executive lounge. Our room was a good size, immaculate and nicely furnished. The bathroom was also large and well appointed, and had a bath as well as a separate shower. We were nice and high up so we had an impressive view of the night skyline. Hotel staff were helpful if not overly friendly. We only ate in the hotel resturant once (there were 3) which was satisfactory but a bit souless as the hotel was relatively empty.The Bund is smack bang in the middle of everywhere you want to go so we had no problems sightseeing or going out to eat. In fact just across the road is a nice frech style bakery if you fancy a little bit of western indulgence. "
the bund hotel ,"Great location Good experience overall. I would definitely return.PROS:Location - Ideal for sightseeing, as most interesting sites (East Nanjin Road, People's Square, Huangpu River, even the Old City &amp; the YuYuan Garden) are within walking distance. Very convenient as well if you are to take the underground, only 5 minutes walk to line no 1.Room - Nothing spectacular but it was quite all right. A/C, SafeBox, etc. Unlimited access to high-speed internet included in the Executive room price. Nice bathroom. The mattress was ok.CONTRAS:- English level of the staff (which is not very friendly, by the way) is pathetic.- Breakfast is rather disappointing - what a pity to get this awful Lipton tea in China! - And if THIS is orange juice, then I am a cupboard.- Due to its central location, if you are not Chinese you are very likely to be harassed by people offering you watches, sunglasses, IPods... as well as girls (there is a red-light district nearby).- I had a little problem with the computer in my room, which I could not fix myself since the OS is in Chinese. But I called the front desk and they came within minutes.- AVOID THEIR CHINESE RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
the bund hotel ,"No air conditioning at night This is my third stay at The Bund as it's a convenient location, with good value for the price, but an ongoing irritant is management's &quot;energy saving&quot; practice of turning off the air conditioning after midnight until 6:00 a.m. Waking at 3:00 a.m. to a warming room is unpleasant. "
the bund hotel ,"Comfortable slightly old fashioned hotel The Bund Hotel is very comfortable. My rooms was very pleasant, although elsewhere in the hotel you do feel that the decor is a little dated and maybe a lick of paint was in order. The breakfast selection was good, although I had dinner on the first night in the restaurant which wasn't so great....would recommend eating outside the hotel in the evening. The concierge are helpful and all speak good English. Its is worth pointing out that the hotel is now quite 5 mins walk from The Bund and Nanjing Shopping street as the website points out - much more like a 10-15min walk, and as a single traveller I felt (perhaps uneccessarily) safer in a taxi, which costs about 50p (UK) to these destinations. I had a few meetings further afield, and it perphaps worth noting that where ever they were, the concierge assured me to journey would only be 10mins which was usually something of a underestimation! "
the bund hotel ,"Nothing special I stayed at the Bund for 5 nights in May. Overall, it's a good standard of hotel. It's nothing exceptional, but it's very pleasant to stay in. The location is good (close to the main shopping road, and 15/20 min walk to the Bund, and 20/25 mins walk to the old town) The room was clean, the bed large, and the bathroom goodies of good quality. No problem with it at all. Just felt like an average international 4* hotel... "
the bund hotel ,"Not too fussed with the Bund Hotel My wife and I recently returned from Shanghai after our first visit to China. (23 -28 May 2008) We might have been spoilt after staying at the Holiday Inn Central Plaza in Beijing which was a comparable price with discounts for booking early.The Bund Hotel is a cheap hotel with everything you need for a comfortable stay. There is a lot of roadwork going on out the front at the moment so there is a bit of noise.The best thing we found was great meals to be had in Shandong Road. When you come out of the hotel turn right and head down toward the Bund and Shandong Road is about 100 metres on the left. For breakfast we ate 'Jianbing' which is like a pancake cooked on a hot circular griddle and is topped with egg then covered in shallots and coriander, a dollop of chili then folded, cut into two and placed in a bag. All this for 2 1/2 yuan and it gets you through to lunch time.For lunch or dinner there is a another place two doors down from where you get the Jianbing where you hand pick the vegetables, tofu, etc you want and they are boiled in a large pot with a delicious soup. Buy a Tsingtao beer across the road for 4.40 yuan and they will set up a table on the side of the road outside the cafe and you have a feast. About 4 yuan for the meal and you can eat like a king for next to nothing.Can also recommend the foot massage at Wei Jun on the Bund side of the Westin Bund Hotel (about 400 metres from the Bund Hotel) for about $7 it is absolute heaven. Take along a Tsingtao with you if you really want to be decadent.Enjoy!!! "
the bund hotel ,"Really Liked the Bund Hotel We arrived in Shanghai on a Sunday afternoon and took a taxi from the bus station to the Bund Hotel. Check-in was smooth (as it was at every hotel at which we stayed in China) and we were soon in our room which we liked very much. I was very surprised to find that in addition to CNN, they had ESPN and a YES broadcast of a Yankees baseball game was on (from a few days before, but still it was the first Yankee game of the season I had been able to see and I was in heaven). The room was extremely comfortable (aside from the hard bed, but in China we knew to expect that and found all beds firm... didn't stop us from sleeping fine, though.) We had booked a Superior Room for 830 RMB, and were given a room on a high floor, looking out on the street and local buildings.We liked the control panel next to the bed, which controlled all the room lights and the television and found the bathroom to be in perfect order with everything you could need and all plumbing working fine).As has been noted, this hotel is in the middle of everything and you can walk to many areas or take one of the multitude of taxis available (except when it's pouring down rain when getting a taxi is the problem you might expect). The doorman was always helpful in flagging a cab for us and the one we requested for our ride to the airport was waiting on schedule. We did walk around at night and didn't have any problems whatsoever. We also got used to walking from the hotel to the Metro entrance at People's Square, which was great because so many lines stop there... about a 10 minute brisk walk. We also enjoyed walking on the streets around the hotel and checking out the local shops and businesses.I used the Helen Huang Spa in the hotel and found the people to be friendly and the foot massage I had was excellent. I also used the computer in the Business Office, which was reasonably priced (but not as cheap as an internet place outside the hotel would have been). The young women working there were very helpful and pleasant. When the connection was very slow, I complained and they gave me extra time. (Note: This is the hotel's connection speed. Later in our trip we went to Beijing and used a free-standing internet place where the connections were much quicker than those in this hotel!)As has been noted, the branch of Paris Baguette, a bakery chain, is right across the street and we picked up goodies for breakfast each evening. On our first day I received a message from our prospective dinner companion (given to us at the desk on check-in and delivered to the room a second time, but both contained the wrong telephone number). The Concierge Desk was able to make a reservation for us at our restaurant of choice, but directions were sometimes unclear and their English wasn't terrific (that's why the number was wrong in the message). They were very nice and tried hard to please... just be aware that this would be an issue if you are very dependent on Concierge service and don't speak Mandarin.On the whole, we liked the Bund Hotel and aside from the long walk to the Metro, I would recommend this hotel. "
the bund hotel ,"Executive Room beats all My wife and I spent two weeks in China staying at various hotels in various cities. This hotel was the best. In Shanghai we pre-booked 2 nights at the Bund and 2 nights at the Radisson New World, thinking that the Bund might not live up to the reviews on this site. We should have stayed the whole time at the Bund, the Radisson was a good hotel and did have a view but the room was more expensive and smaller.The Executive Rooms are on the top (14th) floor only so it is probably best to book early during the busy season. They are a good size (for China) and include a desk. The decor in the room was excellent, the room had dark wood panelling which gave it a very warm homely feel, much better than some of the sterile modern hotels we stayed in later on the trip. The bathroom was immaculate - well designed with a big bath, separate shower and everything kept very clean.The hotel is not actually on the Bund, but it is easy walking distance to the tourist areas of Nanjing Rd and the Bund. This turned out to be a good thing - we were not chased by beggars and people trying to sell us watches etc as soon as we left the hotel. We didn't have the hotel breakfast but there was an excellent French bakery just across the road from the hotel and a few breakfast places that the locals used nearby which were very cheap.The only minor complaint was that the internet (free) was a little slow, but still OK.If we go back to Shanghai again we won't need to check out the hotels on offer, we'll just go straight here. "
the bund hotel ,"Above average for what we paid... just minor quirks For what we paid (approx CAD $100/night), what we got was a decent hotel for Shanghai. Check-in was smooth. I didn't expect staff English to be great but that's okay with me, although the bellhop's English was quite good and even gave us some pointers as we rode the elevator up with him. People have been saying staff are rude... people, this is part of Chinese culture. They are not rude, this is how it is. In North America, we are considered overly polite and fake. But I digress.The room with two doubles was quite large and we were on the 12th floor. Bathroom was nice, all marble with a tub and shower. From afar, the bathroom looked spotless but when you are &quot;sitting&quot; around, you notice they could've done a better job, although was decent enough.I was pleasantly surprised to see the electrical outlets accomodated North American plugs, except two by the tv were not functioning (not a big deal, there were plenty others).I checked out the gym on the 3rd floor and there are only a few items like a treadmill and cycle.The restaurants on the lower floors looked quite busy as a lot of foreigners seemed to like to dine there rather than go out.Noise: I can't remember reading this anywhere but on the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, the restaurant on the 3rd floor turns into a club-like setting with pounding bass-throbbing music. We were on the 12th floor and interestingly enough, we could hear the sound through the washroom, but not in our main room. All I can say is, try to get a floor as high as you can because I can't imagine what they could hear down in the lower floors. It was loud.My other gripe was the internet. I know China blocks out 10% of internet sites so I wasn't sure if half the time the internet was blocked or the connection was flaky. I think it was both. The internet was 80 RMB/24 hours, and if you are going to charge that much, then it better be flawless, blocked sites, or not. One time it went down for a good hour and I had to call someone up to help, which they resolved.Location: ok every review I read said this hotel was central. This is true. It's right in the centre of all the attractions. Meaning, that it's not particular close to everything... just right smack dab in the middle. Can't really complain about that because again, for the price paid, it was fine. Just don't expect to be at the doorstep of main attractions: The Bund, Nanjing Road, People's Square/Shanghai Museum. Although Nanjing Road would be the closest one of the three, about a 7 minute fast walk away (4 blocks). Also, the location is slightly seedy. Keep aware of your surroundings walking around after 9pm walking around the area, although it's still not scary like any major US city.Check-out was also quite smooth. "
the bund hotel ,"Great Hotel I stayed on the executive level, which given that it provides free (reasonably high speed) internet is a small bump in price, and I'm sure afforded a better level of service.Room had chairs that could actually be used for reading, and a nice firm bed that was very welcome after my flight from Chicago.The location was good: I found that pretty much anywhere I wanted to go was in walking distance.My only &quot;suggestion for improvement&quot; is that they should have a Chinese version of their location printable on their website so that cabs could find it more easily from the airport. "
the bund hotel ,"Good Service beds could be better We arrived at the Bund Hotel on the recommendations of fellow Tripadvisor members. This is a great hotel a mere 15 minute walk from the Bund and 5 minutes from Nanjing Road. The service was very good, especially the concierges and bellboys. When we asked for a good Chinese restaurant, they were candid and told to us to go to another restaurant(despite the hotels own Chinese restaurant); since we didn't know the area at the time, the bellboy walked us all the way there (great pick, btw). Like another member said, the nearby French bakery is great and convenient. With that said, the beds were much harder than any other beds we had while in China (and we went to Beijing and Xian). Nevertheless, overall, the hotel has great amenities and services, and its location is top-notch. "
the bund hotel ,"Great Location but concierge needs improvement My husband and I stayed on the &quot;executive floor&quot; at The Bund for two nights in mid-March 2008. We knew little about the hotel because we booked our stay in a rush. Indeed, because of its very reasonable price, we were not expecting very much by way of accommodations and service. Boy were we pleasantly surprised! The hotel's large and airy lobby houses a small concierge stand, a souvenir shop and a small bar area. Because we had an executive floor reservation, however, we didn't check in on the ground level lobby; instead, we were sent to the 20th (or was it 22nd?) Executive floor lobby for check in. The reservation clerk spoke English and was quite courteous and professional. Unfortunately, because we had just arrived from Beijing via the night train, it was 10 am when we attempted to checked in. The clerk told us he could give us our room right away, but it would cost us an additional amount equal to 1/2 day's stay. Alternatively, he offered to let us hang out in the Executive floor lobby until 11 am. We opted for the latter, and were offered coffee, tea and free email access from their computer while we waited. It wasn't so bad.We were very happy with our executive level room - the price for executive level was less than $15 more than a regular room, and well worth the small extra fee. The room was spacious (about 400 square feet), the bathroom was big too, with a separate tub and shower. One complaint about the bathroom is that it could've incorporated more counter space around the bathroom sink for our toiletries, but really, No biggie.We were happy with the cleaning staff as well. Our cleaning lady was efficient and unobtrusive. She picked up our laundry at 11 am, and it was back, hanging in our closet just a few short hours later - and it was very cheap. I'm talking less than $2 (USD) for a pair of shorts - excellent prices!The hotel also houses a few restaurants and a salon that performs massages. We visited the Russian restaurant for a late night dinner (11:30 pm), and were very pleased with the food and the entertainment. The menu included western and Chinese meals - the food was prepared quickly and was very tasty. The entertainment consisted of a singing duo, with the male playing keyboard background music, while his female counterpart sang lead vocals in Russian, English and Chinese tunes. It was cute. A few patrons were dancing, so it was a fun.As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel's location is very good for the price. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to The Bund and the Pudong skyline, and 5 to 10 minute walk to Nanjing Road. The only downside about the location is that it has no interesting view from the hotel room windows - but this can be forgiven in exchange for the bargain price. Lastly, the concierge is not very impressive. On the three days of my visit, it was staffed by only two employees, neither of whom spoke fluent English. They made no recommendations for restaurants or attractions and were generally not helpful in hailing taxis or speaking on our behalf with our Chinese taxi drivers. Concierge staff play a crucial role for travelers, especially when language barriers exist; therefore, this aspect of the hotel’s customer service really needs improvement. Nevertheless, because it is a good value and service was otherwise good, I would stay at this hotel again. "
the bund hotel ,"B E A Utiful Bund! We had 2 superior rooms, one queen and one twin. The twin was an excellent size, the queen was &quot;cosy&quot; but we did not go to Shanghai to tour our room, so this was not a big issue. The bathrooms were immaculate, service excellent and the hotel was quiet at night.We requested no smoking rooms and was pleased to find they have no smoking floors and our request to be on here had been met.Check in and Check out were very quick and simple and I was thrilled that, although I speak Chinese everyone spoke English, even the door attendant.The staff were friendly and very helpful, the door chap was great for directions, advice and getting cabs. Breakfast was pricey by Chinese standards 80Rmb but was varied and very plentiful. We enjoyed the breakfast as it was also quick and easy and we found it suited our need very well i.e eat a hearty meal and get on with the sight seeing. As a paying guest for breakfast (not on our room rate) they did seem keen for us to pay each morning and not run off, we found it quite funny, but this could be annoying to some.All in all we would recommend this hotel as a great place especially as it is really well located, we could walk to Nanjing Road in 5 mins and the tube in 10. Also there is a great Italian restaurant called &quot;Tartufo&quot; 5 mins walk away if Chinese food gets too much.It is worth noting we booked this hotel solely on the great reviews it had received and we were not disappointed. A Great Find! "
the bund hotel ,"Very good locaion It is a very nice hotel in a good location, especially if you enjoy short walks. I actually walked from the hotel to the various tourist spots with no problem. The french bakery across the street is perfect for breakfest and coffee unless you prefer the huge Western and Chinese style buffet breakfest at the hotel.Overall, good experience. "
the bund hotel ,"Loved the Bund! Really liked this hotel. We booked an executive room and it was perfect size - bathroom was good too although the shower could have been a bit more powerful but that's just my opinion! Staff were great, really helped out with directions etc. Location good - walking distance of most things which was great. Breakfast was good - although staff could be a little over attentive, which is not a bad thing but something that took a bit of getting used to!! "
the bund hotel ,"Decent enough hotel...but some problems This hotel was decent enough, with a good location about 15 minutes walking distance from the Bund and Nanjing street, Hunagpu Park, People's Square, etc., but the service needs to be improved. My first night at this hotel, I was ready to take anice, relaxing bath and go to sleep, but after my bath, I couldn't get the tub to drain. Then, when I tried to call downstairs and tell them about the tub, the phone wouldn't work. So, I had to throw my clothes back on and run downstairs and tell them about the tub AND the phone. The lady from the fornt desk came up to my room and then a maintenance guy came. The tub was fixed in maybe 5 minutes. They showed me how to turn the knob to drain the water. But it was hard to turn. So, later, I just used a wash cloth to plug the drain for my baths. I didn't want to take another chance. These people left my room, and I decided to shower after my bath. Well, while I am in the shower, the engineer guy came to check the phone. I had to jump out of the shower and let him in, dripping wet with a towel around me. Pretty embarassing, to say the least.He left within three minutes I'd say. The next day, even though I was up and getting ready to leave, I had my do not disturb button on, so I could get ready and go out for the day. The maid still knocked on my door and pestered me while I was trying to get ready. I told her I had the do not disturb button on, but she said sorry and came in and cleaned anyways, with me having to walk around her while I was getting ready to leave. She left and just a few minutes later, another maid knocked and pestered me. I told her the room had just been cleaned by the other maid. Then the engineer guy came to see about the phone again. I was just on my way out the door and he mumbled something and left his tool box in my room. I was ready to leave and was not about to stand around waiting on him. So, I just left and when I came back later that evening, his tool box was gone and my phone was working. The next day...same story...the maid pestered me again when I had the do not disturb sign on. Overall, good experience, but I probably wouldn't stay here again, unless there was nowhere else available to stay. There is a Westin right down the street, and on the other side of the Bund near Pearl Tower is The Grand Hyatt. I have never had any complaints when I have stayed at a Hyatt. I say go there or to some other hotel. "
the bund hotel ,"Shhhhh.... Don't tell anyone A 4+ star hotel in the heart of the Bund for about USD $120 per night for the concierge level... WOW!.The location was great [10 minute walk to People's Square and 15 minutes to Nanjing Rd shopping (not my cup-o-tea, but very popular for you shoppers)], my room was large, clean and well appointed. I will definitely stay here again.The only negative about this hotel was the downstairs concierge. Very amateurish for a hotel of this good quality. Oh, and I could not figure out how to turn on the TV, but not turn on the light on top of the tv... I had to take out the buld.. Hmmm.. Not a big problem really.Some very good local places to eat nearby or a short taxi ride to anything the Bund has to offer. 10 minute walk to the subway.Definitely a good business travelers hotel. "
the bund hotel ,"Very good location service and room We were in our honeymoon visiting large cities in Asia. I let them know so when booked. We were upgraded to an amazing suite!The Bund is very well located, with a great shopping and walking area next to it.Staff is very kind and helpful.Breakfast buffet is good, although it is not outstanding.We will gladly stay at The Bund again. "
the bund hotel ,"Excellent value I wasn't sure what to expect as I booked this hotel in a rush. We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The room was very big, clean and brilliant value. We were only in Shanghai for a few days so it's central location was very handy. "
the bund hotel ,"Great location at moderate expense On my last trip to Shanghai, my agent booked me into this centrally located hotel in Shanghai. While the name is a bit misleading, I must say the location is brilliant. A short 10 minute walk will take you to both The Bund area, or Nanjing Road.The rooms are nice, well appointed, with CNN as the only english speaking channel. Service is good, breakfast acceptable. Diagonally across the street however is a fantastic alternative to get breakfast, a french influenced bakery with very good coffee and fresh pressed orange juice. "
the bund hotel ,"Great Service This was my first trip to China and I travelled solo ... felt very safe and had no problems getting to hotel or about town. The hotel is centrally located but at least a 10 - 15 min walk from The Bund itself and about 5 - 10 mins from museum and People's Square. The staff and concierege especially were very helpful, and all spoke fairly good English so no problems with communication. Had lunch and dinner on the restaurant on 2nd floor and both were very good. Close to ATM machines and usual fast food conveniences, and also small mom&amp;pop local cuisine. Room &amp; bathroom very roomy - I had a non-smoking room/double on 15th floor ,,,only complaint is carpet needed a thorough steam cleaning. But service was great and I would stay there again. "
the bund hotel ,"Loved the Bund Hotel The Bund Hotel in Shanghai was the last stop on our 5 city tour of China. We were very impressed by the size and decor of the rooms. It is like a boutique hotel, a real gem in a country where top price or 5 star rating can mean a much lesser accomodation than expected.The Bund is a lovely hotel, we felt very at home in the room and enjoyed the large marble bathroom, with tub and glass shower stall. Our other &quot;4 and 5&quot; star hotels in China had the smallest bathrooms I've ever seen. The breakfast buffet was very good with a wide variety of western and chinese choices. It is 3 blocks walk to Nanjing Road, and only a little farther to walk to the Bund. We ran out of time, so took a Taxi from the far end of the Bund to the Hotel for only 11 Yuan. It is also only 11 Yuan to the Yu Yuan Garden and shopping bazaar in the old Chinese concession, a must-see in Shanghai.The only problem we encountered at the Bund Hotel was the hard mattresses. This seems to be a problem thoughout China. However, we mentioned it to our Guide and she requested extra comforters to be used as mattress toppers. Overall, I would recommend the Bund Hotel, and hope to stay there again in the the future. "
the bund hotel ,"Nice rooms but bad experience overall and wouldn't stay here again I had problems checking in to this hotel as they had given my room away, and they lied to me twice about whether they had rooms available. They also made me switch rooms half way through my stay and tried to make me pay more for the room than the rate agreed on reservation through the hotel's website.The staff were unhelpful and not trained to international standards (or even in the hotel's booking systems). They weren't sympathetic to my situation, and made me work to resolve their cock ups.There were other minor problems too with the hotel services, such as the room key not working.I filled out a feedback form detailing these problems, and not surprisingly I haven't heard back from them.On the plus side, the rooms were very comfortable and modern, and the location was pretty good. However, the other problems outweighed this and I definitely wouldn't stay here again.If you want my advice, stay in the Shanghai YMCA. It's 1/3 of the price, less plush but a very comfortable 3 star, and the service and location is excellent. "
the bund hotel ,Nice Staff good location and breakfast Stayed at the Bund 3 nights. The staff was polite. The breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced. 
the bund hotel ,Fantastic reasonable priced hotel in great position Our family of six stayed in three rooms at the Bund for 6 nights. Our room had two TV sets and toiled for visitors. The two young people in the family had a business suite with computer and internet. The staff were very helpful especiall Patrick and Leo who got us a taxi and wrote our destination in Chinese. We were very pleased with the Bund. 
the bund hotel ,"Great stay in Centre of Shanghai The Bund is new and well equiped in terms of facilities. Rooms are large, and bathroom was massive and marble, and modern and clean. The Bund was our first stay in China and compared favourably with similar business type places in UK and US for 4****. Location was great for us, walking distance to The Bund (but no view so dont be fooled by the name as it is set back about 10 mins from it) and the museum, and short cab rides to the rest. I would recommed it for those who want something close to the centre at reasonable cost. "
the bund hotel ,"Excellent rooms Very comfortable and well equipped room although the carpets had seen better days. Excellent buffet breakfast for Y85. Downsides: immediate area around the hotel is not the best and it is a good 15 minute walk to the Bund, Peoples Square and the nearest underground station. "
the bund hotel ,"Recommend the Bund This hotel was very clean and convenient, a good jumping off point for exploring Shanghai. It is good value for its price. We had a non-smoking double room with free Internet that was exactly as advertised. We were really happy with the service as well. It was easy to get taxis in front of the hotel and it is a short 10 minute walk to the Bund and you can easily walk around the river and then head back to the hotel at night.The front desk was very friendly and recommended several local restaurants to us.Would recommend this as a good, cheaper alternative to American chain hotels like the Westin, which is down the street. "
the bund hotel ,Nice hotel great value Even my friend from Shanghai commented that this hotel was a steal given the location (literally a 5 minute walk from Nanjing Road) and quality of rooms (the Deluxe room I had on the 4th floor was more like a suite). I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Shanghai - it is a beautiful hotel and a great value. 
the bund hotel ,"Pleasantly surprised great rooms We were surprised to see a PC with a free internet connection when we arrived at our room at the Bund Hotel. We were given a smoking room which fortunately did not smell like smoke. Very nice marble bathrooms and elevators, clean room, and quiet location. Average food at the Western restaurant. Unfortunately, the Chinese restaurant was missing most of the items on the menu and gave us cold, undercooked rice with barely lukewarm tea. Walking distance to both People’s Park and Nanjing East train stations. "

the bund riverside hotel ,Felt cheated on extras The location is good but has lot of construction going on. Watch out for what is being charged extra in this hotel. A laundry bag could cost you USD$ 7/-. 
the bund riverside hotel ,solid not opulent but clean and comfy and GREAT location very solid hotel in good location - walking to hi-end shops and close to city central. Very safe. Beds a little hard but that is common in China. This place was solid without any real red flags. We got it as part of tour package so not sure of pricing but this is a solid cant go wrong business class hotel that was more than fine for tourists. Comparable to a Four Points or a Courtyard. 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Pick a different place. Nasty neighborhood, near auto repair and machine parts shops. Under construction. Rooms lacking some basic amenities, like dresser drawers. Lots of better choices in Shanghai. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Disaster Don't ever consider staying at The Bund Riverside Hotel. It is disgusting.The lobby looked OK with the obligitory chandelier but beyond that it was a disaster.Rooms small and very tired. Toilet did not flush, rooms lights flickered and made a zapping sound, the airconditioner was noisy, the curtains were dirty. Once varnished timber trim painted brown. The dining room where breakfast was served was disgusting. Curtains hanging off hooks and not clean. Walls water stained. Utensels for tea/coffee/congee/cereal and toaster were not clean. Staff uniforms not clean. No conception of service. Little comprehension of English. Reception and housekeeping was no better. No conception of service and little understanding of English. (They actually asked us if we spoke English). The only thing going for it - close to Nanjing Walking Street. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Terrible!!! The rooms are dirty, the service is terrible. The price is much higher then what the hotel give you. The breakfast (that cost 90 RMB!!!) is ridiculous.There are many many hotels in Shanghai, don't choose this one! "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Nice furniture comfortable bed lovely bathroom...but find something in the French Concession For the price, the place was great. Definitely skip the overpriced restaurant and bar...but the rooms are tastefully decorated and nice (the carpet was the only thing showing age). The staff was alright, good by Chinese standards (meaning if you expect people to be fluent in English or be overly polite, maybe China isn't the right place for you...the staff speak English well here and were much more professional than any other place we stayed in China). The location is okay, however almost all of the Bund is destroyed due to Expo 2010 construction, but this affects all hotels in the area. One bonus is the windows are thick and if you can get up room on the upper floors, there is no noise. If you are wanting to stay in this area, the hotel is great, although I would suggest finding a hotel in the much nicer French Concession. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"great choice good value We booked this hotel in Shanghai as last stay in China on our honeymoon. We were quite worried about the type of hotel we had booked, as it doesn't belong to any international chain of hotels available in the centre of Shanghai and we were aware that you never know what to expect when you're so far away from home. We have been very much surprised to see that the hotel is located in a strategic position, perfect I dare say, for those who don't want to spend too much but still whish to stay in the centre, just behind Nanjin Road. Many attractions could be reached on foot! We had been given a fantastic room on top floor with a panoramic view on the skyscrapers. Wonderful. This is the best hotel we could ever choose in Shanghai, we have had a great time. Of course there are many other hotels that can offer you 5 stars service but as already said, this is a good choiche at non expensive rates. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Not bad if you get a good rate. We stayed for 6 nights on the 12th floor in a Superior City View room. Overall, the hotel was good but the main reason was that we got a rate of 53USD through Travelocity. Except for the carpet, the room was clean with a big bathroom and comfortable bed. The view wasn't particularly good, but not an issue. Outside noise was low and not bothersome.PROS: After the rate, the second strong point is the location. It's a 10 minute walk to Nanjing road and the metro station and maybe 20 minutes to the Bund.CONS: As some others have noted, the carpet was stained and very unattractive. However, it wasn't &quot;dirty&quot; and that was the only cleanliness issue we encountered. Second, in spite of listing it as a PRO, the location could have been better. We used the metro a lot, and would have liked to be closer, especially when it was raining. Also, the hotel is located in a industrial supply neighborhood so there aren't as many food vendors/shops and restaurants as we'd like. And, it just makes for an unattractive area for walking. Breakfast, which wasn't included in our rate, was okay but very expensive at about 14USD. Internet, at 1 yuan per minute, was pricey. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Good value great location amazing Pudong views We chose a superior room with Pudong view. It was very comfortable, had two queen size beds, safe, coffee/tea making facilities, bathrobes...at affordable price. Had breakfast the first day but found it not quite good and pricey. Just five minutes walking from Naning Rd. and metro station.Reception staff was helpful but some of them didn´t speak much english.I recommend it for a fee nights in Shanghai with a good view if your budget is not too high. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great hotel - value Please ignore all other bad reviews of this hotel as I was amazed what a great vale hotel it was. My wife &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and only booked a week before so paid NZ$85 per night with no breakfast. We were surpirswed how modern the hotel was and for a Chinese 4 star wasn't expecting much. But it is clean and centrally located to both the Bund &amp; Nanjing Rd (max 10 mins walk). Ok some of the back roads to the hotel from Nanjing Rd are dirty but THIS is China so what do people expect!!! We walked everywhere &amp; late at night and NEVER felt remotely threatened so no issue there. The location is fantastic and for the price I paid great value. Put it in perspective &amp; if you want a clean, central hotel for no cost then go here. If you want a Hyatt style hotel then forget it but realise you get what you pay for in this life so if you want a modern hotel then expect to pay Hyatt prices.Recommended for all visitors. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Disappointing The hotel was clean and with great facilities, but the staff are not very helpful. Room service breakfast was mostly cold and congealed, despite inflated price.Unbelievable charge for internet use of 30 Yuan (approx GB£3.00) PER MINUTE! It was also quite slow, presumably in order to be able to charge more money. "
the bund riverside hotel ,OK Great Things about this hotel:- Very roomy- $50/night- Location is a 5 min to Nanjing Rd which was a pedestrian mall. Pretty cool..- 10 min walk to the nearest subway station.- Helpful staffNegative things:- Bathroom stunk. Something really needed to be replaced - like the curtains.- Carpet was is poor condition- Don't eat at the Hotel. It's gross and expensive.- I'm not usually picky with beds but this hotel has really really hard beds. I always woke up feeling pain in my shoulders. 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Clean quiet well priced brilliant location.. I stopped in and stayed here for one night, on a business trip.If a clean , quiet, easy to get to Hotel is what you seek, then look no further! The Bund Riverside is well priced ($70USD a night on WOTIF), and I will use it again next time I pass through ShanghaiReally really close to the underground station of Nanjing Road East (Number 2 exit)..Only a 3-5 minute walk through a (dirty) little lane, you will be at Nanjing Road!!Bugger that they charge for Internet connection (1 Yuan per minute, or 100 Yuan for 24 hours). .....the breakfast was 50 yuan for the usual array of food associated with China...hence I gave it a wide nerth and ate elsewhere. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"If you want only a room Yes it's near the famed Nanjing Donglu (Nanjing Road East), but it's not a pleasant walk. It's an inspiring walk to the station only if you're interested in seeing the place for real - chaotic traffic, non -stop horning, touts outside rather depressing eateries, hardware stores, construction sites, vegetable peddlers, locals who suddenly turn, spit or litter as they talk. Not making a judgement about the locals (they're regular people like everyone everywhere else) but it's a snapshot of the scene I've encountered 4 days in the neighbourhood. Nothing green, nothing retail along the way to the station.Buildings under construction line the various routes to the hotel. What this means is that the usual pedestrian walkways are blocked (they do not carve out alternatives under such buildings) and pedestrians are forced to negotiate the road with bikes, motorbikes and cars, all of which don't give way even if lights are in your favour. It's especially difficult if it's raining (frequent in the summer).There are 2 or 3 dusty convenience stores along the various routes to the hotel where you can pick up water and snacks, but if you're expecting the clean, fresh, mouthwatering snacks or bento like those you get in such stores in Taipei or Tokyo, forget it. Got a grand view room, it looks out to other buildings. It's spacious but everything is aging. Old TV but you get star movies, BBC and CNN, no HBO. Turn it off for a while if it goes quiet, the sound comes back on the next time. The carpet is stained in some parts but the bathroom is clean enough, just a little rusty. The horning from the streets can be heard even from the room on the 9th floor. They will ask for a 600 yuan deposit at check in, no matter what your online agent says about prepaid bookings, so just prepare the money. Good value if you just want a room and some breakfast. But if your idea of Shanghai is the Nanjing Road East for shopping and the Bund, it's probably better to stick to those on Nanjing Road if you can pay for them. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"good value for money we stayed fr. 20th to 27th may. the first impression was not good. the carpet was badly stained. we asked to switch room, and they offered an upgrade but the room was much smaller, so we opted to stay in the same room as the front desk said they're running full occupancy. we checked out for on the 3rd day for an overnite stay at hangzhou but left our luggage with them and when we came back, they gave us an upgrade room (we didn't ask for it, so it was a very pleasant surprise), carpet was clean, room was even bigger than the one we had stayed in. for what we paid, i think its very good value. the staff were very helpful and tried their best to assist. there're a lot of constructions going on outside the hotel, but this is due to the Expo. the hotel is within walking distance to most attractions and cabs are easy to get and cheap. breakfast was very very boring. same thing for the entire stay. we had free internet and it was working well.in gist, its very good value for what we paid &amp; we had a very pleasant stay.

the bund riverside hotel ,Dont go to this hotel...EVER Horriable is not the word if i need to mention about my experience...first time visit to Shanghai and heard a lot about the Bund area as such so when i saw the hotel listing where in it mentioned that it is located at the bund and at a great price i grabed the deal not knowing that this stupid hotel was in this commercial horriable area few blocks away from the bund and the view from my SUITE in this hotel was of the slums....Dont go in this hotel EVER 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great hotel great location great value Stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to boarding a cruise ship. The location was great for exploring the Bund area. Quick and inexpensive taxi rides got us to the other major attractions. Hotel was very nice as was the staff. We had a few snacks in the lobby coffee shop and had some room service (average), but there were several restaurants in the hotel. The spa was convenient and open until 2AM for late massages after long days. One small warning for disabled travelers: the entrance to the hotel is up a long flight of stairs from the street. There is also a lot of construction in the area (and all of Shanghai) due to the upcoming Expo. "
the bund riverside hotel ,Good value for money This hotel is clean and well located. A block away from Najin street to the north and a very short walking distance from the Bund. Rooms are clean and bright and everything worked just fine. 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Good hotel near Nanjing Road The hotel is very close to Bund and Nanjing Road, in fact within walking distance. The area surrounding is bit dirty with construction and repair going on on nearby buildings. The hotel is clean and rooms with twin beds and window facing are good. However some rooms with queen bed is small. Rooms are clean. Breakfast menu is same everyday and never changes which I dont like. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"More of a 3 star hotel!!! I stayed at this hotel for a quick trip into Shanghai. It was a four night stay and overall it was a pleasant experience. I booked through Travelocity and they has this hotel pegged as a four star hotel. I beg to say even though this hotel has a nice lobby and the rooms are spacious this hotel is not a 4 star. The room it self was clean and spacious and the bed well, as everyone on here can tell you it was hard as a rock. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but some might. The downside of this hotel was the ac unit itself was not really working, I had it full blast and it barely got cool in the room. My friend who had another room, his ac unit was not working at all. He called and talked to the front desk about it several times to no avial. Luckily it was not that hot and survived with opening the windows. I had a room with a city view, needless to say the view was not that great. The breakfast was the same the four days we were there, no change at all. I would not recommend paying extra for breakfast if its not included. You can get better off site. There is a lot of construction going on in the areas, specifically next to the hotel. They usually start kind of early so get ready to hear metal banging. The internet is the room was included but I had issues with the download speed. It seemed to take forever, while my buddy said he has no problems. There is no WIFI signal. The TV in the room sucked. There were only maybe 3 English channels and the reception was horrible. I do have a trick, the tv itself is only a monitor and you can hook up the monitor to your laptop and you can play dvds from your laptop onto the big screen or even surf from there. All you have to do is disconnect the monitor cable from the cable box from the back of the tv and connect it to your laptop and to get sound disconnect the green audio cable and connect it to the headphone jack on your laptop. The location is pretty good. The main shopping street is about 5 mins away and you can find a lot of places to eat or shop at. There is a 24 McD's close by and I would recommend a restaurant called CW or CB Coffe house. they serve food in a coffee house enviornment. The food was good, the steak did not have a funny taste like most foreign countries do. I would only stay here again if the price was right. I would definetly try to find something with a pool next time. The hotel is a good base hotel and just for laying your head at night time. Don't expect grand things from this place. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Very Pleasantly Surprised After a lot of debating as to whether to stay here, The Manhattan Business Hotel, or Charms, I was won over by this one. I wanted a great view so I asked for a digital queen on the 16th floor on my booking form (Riverside) which they honoured. The 17th is just below the restaurant and noisy as a previous reviewer pointed out and the view from the 16th is just as good. The room was not very big but there was a King bed with a desk, free internet, flat screen TV with CNN International and a few other news stations. There was also a great bathroom with stand alone shower which I really enjoyed the rainwater effect. Best of all, there was a bench in front of the window which protruded and you could sit there, chill and enjoy the city lights. As a solo traveller it was fine, but might have been a bit cramped had 2 people been in there.Service was good and began with a prompt reply to my email giving me the name of the hotel in Chinese and the address. This is essential if you are arriving by cab as the driver will not recognise the name. The staff and bell boys were very helpful but as I decided to stay an extra night, they could not give me a better rate than the one I found on expedia so I secured it that way and there was no problem. I read previous reviews of dirty windows obscuring the view, but as luck would have it, the window cleaners were there during my stay, see enclosed photo. :)Breakfast was in the restaurant on the top floor with very helpful staff and great views. They really can't do enough to help you there.I was a bit worried about the location, but it's about a 5 minute walk to Nanjing Road and the metro station. The neighbourhood was great with convenience stores everywhere and a relief from the tinsel and pestering on the Nanjing Road. I can understand it looking shady, but it was not at all. I was glad it was in an authentic area and best of all, there is a bank next door, too.Overall, I'd say, that you could have a great time in a central location without spending a fortune and relax in comfort at the end of a hard day of walking and sightseeing. Remember to get a Riverside view, though. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Excellent location once you get your bearings We had 5 nights here in March and where very impressed for the price we paid, only slight downside was the beds being very hard but that seems to be a chinese staple.Would definately stay here again. Rooms spacious, breakfast quite good, and staff very helpfull. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Bund River side hotel - Good choice for business Bund river side hotel is located in very near of Nanjing Road. Easy to access shopping streets and other amenities. Hotel will provide internet connection, which is rather expensive (100 RMB / day). Nice and friendly staff. The girls at lobby bar were very friendly. Maybe because i'm blond, 30'ish young man? Bund River Side Hotel is for you, if you are looking for basic accommodation. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"5 star excellent service We have booked for 4 nights stay with Bund Riverside for a Grand View Room 1615. Grand view room are very spacious with a King size bed. The bathroom is very new and spacious with separate bathtub, bathing and toilet section. No funny smell as mentioned by other reviewers.The best deal is to book through the hotel own website and registered as a member will entitled you for some freebies. Highly recommended for their hotel service - 5 star standard, fast and efficient. Initially we got a twin bed room and I've called to change to another room with king size bed. In 5 minutes time, the reception immediately arranged to bring us to view and change to the higher 16th floor at no additional charges. Location is about 3 streets away from the noisy and bustle Nanjing Road, about 10 minutes walking to Line 2, Nanjing East metro. My 5 years old boy enjoyed the walk. On the way back, will pass by some covenience stalls that you can grab some snacks and drinks back to hotel.Shanghai implement &quot;bring your own bag&quot; concept, chargeable for plastic bags. Very environment friendly. Do remember to bring your own tote bag when go shopping. Also highly recomended the Marcom Manager, Eric Wong who is always so accomodating and responsive to my email requests. Also the Front Office Manager, Phillips who personally came to carry our luggages to the lobby and personally called a cab for us to the airport. He even gave us his personal number to assure us if there are any hippcups on the way to airport. Added personal and VIP treatment that I received from Bund Riverside for my family. I will definitely highly recommend to anyone who visit Shanghai. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Unfriendly and unwelcoming - would not recommend to anyone We were only in the hotel for an hour, however got a pretty good feel for the place from that. It was the third hotel we stayed at in China and had booked it because of the location and positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The staff were very unwelcoming when we arrived and the problem came with the baby cot they provided for our young son. I'd emailed and called to check they had one that was appropriate (ie safe and he couldn't fall out of) but the one they provided was totally inadequate. You'd expect that they'd try to help us out and find a solution (ie lower the cot as it was too high and our son would have fallen out/or provided another room with a larger bed/mattress on floor) - who knows - but they never even tried and seemed perfectly happy for us to leave. We had to find another hotel and whilst my husband searched on the internet I followed my son around the lobby area - it was very dirty/staff unfriendly and we were grateful to leave. Had we stayed our experience of Shanghai would not have been positive - however changing hotels meant we ended up having a wonderful end to our holiday. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Perfect Location The hotel is in a perfect place for tourist, 5 minutes walk for the most famous shopping street, nagging road, and for the riverside to see Pudong, also for qipu market where you can buy anything. Rooms are not really big, but bed and badroom are king size, river view, breakfast ok, snacks include. I will stay any time i came to shanghai for sure. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Not that great Coming from a great hotel in Beijing which was also a 4 star, I really expected more here. Staff were not friendly and were not helpful at all. I mean, a smile or saying hi to the guests doesnt hurt, and not once did I get that. Asking for help was a big issue since they didnt speak much english. Also, the hotel room was clean, except our main concern was the sewage smell coming out of the bathroom. It got to a point when my sister and I had to put orange peels in hot water to try and get rid of the smell. The location is only 5 minutes about from East Nanjing Rd so it's great to walk, but a few people have told me not to walk through the lanes at night since it's not that safe. Also, we went in Dec so alot of the area is under constrcution. There is lots of hammering starting in the morning, and do avoid getting the &quot;riverside&quot; view, since it's alot of construction men working!My other concern was getting a taxi back to the airport. Since I went with my family, 1 taxi wasnt big enough so we asked them to book a maxi taxi. The thing is, the hotel was charging us 260 RMB, where as when we came to the hotel from the airport in a maxi taxi, it costs us only 150 RMB! They kept on insisting that the maxi taxi dropped us off &quot;down town&quot; that's why it was 150 RMB, but we were dropped off in FRONT of the hotel. Phil, the man that booked us the taxi was not very friendly and seemed impatient with us when we brought up the price differences and he kept saying that we weren't dropped off at the hotel! We did take the hotels maxi taxi and unwillingly paid the 260 RMB since we couldnt find our own maxi taxi. Just a quick note, the maxi taxi provided by the hotel was very very old and didn't even have a meter. (Our maxi taxi from the airport to the hotel was new and cheaper and HAD a meter!)Overall I was really unsatisfied with the hotel and there dishonesty. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Service the best This was a great place. The rooms are huge. The food was excellent and we had our own room for lunch. The location was perfect. Sat in the bar for hours, easy to relax in the lobby. Best place we stayed in our travels. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great views helpful staff The Bund Riverside is easy to get to from East Nanjing Rd metro station - about a 5-minute walk along a road with restaurants, a great little massage place and a couple of 24-hour supermarkets stocking big bottles of Tsingtao and Reeb for under AU$2 a pop. Hotel has a modern feel, is clean (except maybe the outside of the rooms' windows), most of the staff speak some English(ish) and there's a bar in the lobby and a restaurant on the 18th floor. Best of all are the views if you book a River View room. Our room (1708) had jaw-dropping views over to Pudong. Windows were grimy (from construction work below the hotel on a bridge over the Suzhou Creek) and when it rained the dripping on the bay window's flat ceiling got a little annoying - but all in all, for the price we paid (approx $600 for the 7 nights) - an absolute bargain! OK, it's not the Four Seasons but it's nicer than most hotels you will find in Australia at the price. Our room was one of the smaller ones, but the bed was big, bathroom massive, shower huge, everything new, BIG flat screen LCD TV with 50 channels (you've got to love Chinese ads) including CNN, BBC etc, and a bay window you could throw pillows on and sit back, soak in the views, sounds and smells (the windows open) while drinking cheap, tasty beer from the shops. The mattress was hard - but been told that's standard in China. I would recommend a River View room, but maybe avoid the 17th floor. It is directly below the restaurant, so you hear noises as staff move around tables at all hours, plus being the highest floor for rooms the bay window has a flat ceiling directly below the rain overflow off the roof. A couple of floors down wouldn't ruin your view of the Pearl Tower or Pudong. And maybe negotiate for a bigger room. We sneaked a peek inside one of the suites and they look really big. The stores all along Beijing Rd below the hotel sell industrial stuff - valves, washers and assorted metal things - but you can walk to the Bund in 10 minutes, Nanjing Rd in 5 and stores are all really close. Location is excellent if you plan to walk a lot or use the metro, which is the quickest and cheapest way to get around the city (ticket machines have English translations, most trips cost 3 or 4 yuan). And it's on Metro line 2, which connects from Longyang Rd station where the Pudong airport Maglev line stops. Took us 30 minutes from the airport to get to the hotel by train, very simple. The hotel will give you a China Daily newspaper on request (in English) and can exchange most of the major currencies (slightly better rates at the hotel than we got in Australia), plus there's a Bank of China next door. And they have cards at reception with the hotel location - plus all the most popular sights - in Chinese in case you take a taxi. We didn't eat in the hotel (too many choices in Shanghai) so no idea about the food. Overall, if you are in Shanghai to explore the real Shanghai and need a cheaper hotel close to the Bund, Nanjing Rd and within walking distance of the Old Town - plus a metro stop - I'd absolutely recommend it. Pudong might have much fancier places to stay, but the real Shanghai is on this side of the Huangpu River. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Bund Riverside Hotel Shanghai I recently stayed at the Bund Riverside Hotel in Shanghai Oct. 7th through the 10th. I must say this is one of the nicest hotels for the money that I have ever stayed in. I had read some reviews prior to my trip that made me a bit uneasy but I decided to book the room anyway. The staff was always willing to help and although English skills were limited it is in China! I think alot of western travelers expect everybody to speak English in the rest of the world. I think it's nice that they speak any English at all and are eager to help. The hotel is only a short walk to Nanjing rd. and a pleasant fifteen minute walk to the Bund. Some reviews claimed that it was far from the Bund and Nanjing rd. I guess if your lazy and don't like to walk it might seem far but I found the walk through the neighborhood interesting. I do advise walking down one of the streets to the Bund other than Nanjing rd. to experince real China. As far as the Hotel is concerned the room was fabulous with a stuning view of the city. I had read in reviews complaints about dirty carpet and mold in the shower, everything in my room was spotless and seemed to be recently renovated. I enjoyed drinks on the 18th floor lounge with panoramic view of the Bund. I highly reccomend The Bund Riverside, I have stayed in four star hotels that were five times the cost and not as nice! "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great hotel incredible view I did stay three nights at the Bund Riverside in Sept 2008. Great and spacious room at 15th floor with a nice view on Pudong, close to Nanjing Road and the Bund.The room was the cleanest I ever got during my whole stay in China, and even in the small details (except the mildew around the bath, but it's quite common in all hotels in China apparently...)Only downside : the breakfast room at 18th floor is quite quickly overflowed, and breakfast itself is average (croissants have the consistancy of a spounge). "
the bund riverside hotel ,"great deal This hotel is fantastic for the price. I paid 580 for a deluxe room with a view of the Pudong. You will read some comments below where people are saying that this is not is a good area. I would absolutely disagree, it's a great area and right in the middle of all the old 30's houses along with what I call &quot;life&quot; going on around you. If you want something more sterile choose one of the more boring areas of town where the have booted all the ordinary Chinese people out in the name of progress.And by the way, those buildings behind the hotel are not a 'shanty town' as one person commented, they the traditional Chinese houses where people have lived for the past 100 years. I went for a walk in there one day and had a great few hours roaming around. (See attached pic). These will be knocked down by next year according to the few people I met who are moving out to suburbia somewhere. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Don't stay here The good: Somewhat cheap, although it was more expensive that I thought. I bet you can find cheaper hotels in a better location.The bad: Carpet was really dirty. The shower had mildew growing all over it. Hotel location is far from everything, even a metro stop. We had to walk at least 3 blocks to the nearest metro.Overall, I would not stay at this hotel. If I went to Shanghai again, I would try to stay in the French Quarter. This hotel was too dirty and far away from everything. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great Hotel! Great hotel, friendly staff with passable English and a GREAT location. While the immediate surrounding area is nothing to write home about, the hotel is only two blocks from a Metro station and the main downtown area on this side of the river. You can definitely walk to the Bund, but it's probably about 20 minutes. Great value too! "
the bund riverside hotel ,A nice hotel Leaving China I had to fly out of Shanghai so I stayed at the riverside for one night. I wish I could have stayed here longer.A nice room for a good price. 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Fine but there are better located hotels The rooms in this hotel are very nice, large and spacious with a good bathroom. No complaints whatsoever about the room. The location of the hotel however is not exactly fantastic. It is only a short walk to Nanjing Road and about 15minutes to the Bund.However, if I was staying in Shanghai again I would prefer to stay in the French Concession as it is a much nicer area with a nicer atmosphere. The Riverside Bund is somewhat on a side street with a lot of hardware shops and run down flats. The breakfast is terrible! Honestly, don't waste your money on it. Overall, we were happy with our stay in this hotel. The staff were EXTREMELY helpful and spoke decent English (do not underestimate how important this is in China). It was relatively cheap (£41 for double room) for such a nice hotel. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great location and good hotel We visited shanghai on our last leg of the china tour at the end of May 08. We've been to many 4-5 star hotels on the trip in Beijing, Xi'an, Suzhou, Guilin. This one in Shanghai is one of our favorites. The location is great -- walking distance to Nanjing Road and the Bund Riverside. There're also some interesting local streets nearby where you can find food stands, convenient stores and just local life all day long. The breakfast buffet was great, although someone on our tour claimed to have got food poison from uncooked bacon at the omelet bar. Our room on the 11th floor was really clean, probably newly remoded. It's not big, but suffient. It has a gorgeous view over the bund and the high rises on the east side. In the evening, everything's lit up and it's beautiful. The TV has many channels to choose from including a number of english channels like CNN. Overall, we'd definitely stay here again when we come back to Shanghai on our own. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Nice hotel in good location The hotel is in very good condition, room was very clean and furnished in an elegant modern style with flat-screen tv. Located close to Nanjing Road (main shopping street).Hotel staff is helpful and English speaking (more or less). Breakfast was really great with a large choise of different dishes. The panoramic window of the breakfast room offers a nice view.Whenever you go by taxi you need to have the Chinese address with you. At the reception desk you get a biz card where the address of the hotel as well as the most important tourist attractions are mentioned in Chinese. Take it with you, it's really helpful! "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Very dissapointed with the Bund Riverside Hotel.... Having stayed at the Bund Riverside hotel before, I decided to book it again for my next business trip.I hate to say that the service and hotel have really gone backward since the last time.The internet speed for a start is a joke, as is the 1RMB per minute charge.Breakfast is very poor, the croissants tasted like they had been there for 3 days, there are not enough seats for all the staying guests to have breakfast, so one has to cue until someone leaves.The noise with all the construction work going on outside is unbearable and carries on through the night.The aircon doesnt work, which trust me in Shanghai's muggy climate is a must.There was no hot water, so I had a cold shower on both mornings.The front-desk staff were not helpful when all the above problems were pointed out and are only there to check you in and check you out, dont ask for anything else.In conclusion very poor and I wont be staying at the Bund Riverside next time. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great location and pleasing stay for a first visit to China This was our first vist to China, taking in Beijing, Dalian (business part of the trip) and Shanghai. I cannot understand the negative comments from some reviewers. We have travelled many parts of the world extensively and while this is not the best hotel we've stayed in, it is far from the worst! We were fortunate to get a great room high up with super views over the Huangpu river and the skyline featuring the landmark Pearl TV tower - smog permitting. We spent part of the two evenings we were there sipping some Great Wall Merlot while gazing out from our room window over the superb views and watching all the shipping traffic on the river. The room was clean, the front desk staff friendly and extremely helpful. Cannot comment on the food as we did not eat at the hotel, there is a wide choice of resturants in nearby Nanjing Road.We would certainly stay at the Bund again. One word of advise, try and get a room high up (for the view and to minimise the traffic/construction noise) and one that overlooks the river. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Good stay in a central hotel Stayed here during an escourted trip round China in Sept 07. Overall a good hotel with nice rooms but most of all in a convenient location. Only a few mins walk from Nanjing Road which is the main shopping thoroughfare. If you like shopping this is the place to go with modern shopping centres and high quality western type shops. The hotel is also only 5 mins walk from The Bund, the famous riverside walkway.However, dont be expecting some romantic riverside view from your window ! We overlooked a tributary of the river which wasnt particularly nice too look at, mainly because of the shanty town the other side of the river ! Have to say they were demolishing it all and probably by the time you read this there is likely to be a beautiful high rise building it its place. With the speed the buildings go up in Shanghai, there was probably a high rise by the time our airplane took off from Shanghai Intl airport !Overall a very smart clean hotel located centrally. Staff (as always in China) were extremely helpful. Tip: Take one of the hotels cards. On the back it has all the main tourist sites in English &amp; Chinese. Just tick where you want to go and show the taxi driver ! Quick, easy and cheap !! (taxis are so cheap !!) "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Ok but don't bother with the breakfast! We went to this hotel as it was the one that had the best reviews within our budget and was located very centrally.And we weren't disappointed. We got a cheap online deal at U$85 a night excl. breakfast. For the money I have no complaints. The hotel rooms are located on the higher floors of the hotel (11th?-17th). The lower floors are conference rooms, popular for weddings so you will probably run into a bride.Our room was the standard double which was probably quite a small room for the hotel standards (25m2 incl bathroom). It still had a queen sized double, TV with 5 English language channels including BBC and CNN, mini bar, desk, decent sized wardrobe with sadly Chinese sized bathrobes and an ok bathroom with the usual soap, shampoo, shower cap and something you don't find usually: condoms! In 2 sizes even!!. Made us laugh! The room and bathroom were cleaned everyday.Our view was of Suzhou creek. Sounds nice, looks crap. They are tearing down the entire old neighbourhood to build more skyscrapers. (Very typical and sad, happens all over Shanghai). They start doing that at 7AM and the windows aren't double glazed so you do hear that in the background (even if you are on the 12th floor). Also the walls are not very thick so you will hear somebody's tv as a murmur too. As I always wear earplugs neither bothered me too much. Breakfast is not included and if you are smart (or on a budget) you pick up something small like yogurt from the corner shop across the road and then have a proper meal later one. Eating out is very cheap in China. If you do have breakfast in the hotel you have two options. For U$8 you can have a standard English/continental breakfast on the top floor. It is ok but not brilliant. And the coffee is not good. The downstairs lounge/cocktail bar is better, you order good club sandwiches or another snacks from their menu. Not that cheap for either Chinese or Western standards though.Staff tried to be helpful but not everybody speaks English very well, or at all. Which can be a bit tiring but is very typical for China.In the end, with some pointing at words in my dictionary or travel guide, we usually got there. What is very useful though, is that they will provide you with cards which have the hotel address in Mandarin, a number of useful phrases and will write down to whatever address you need to go in Shanghai.Location is pretty good, a 5 minute walk from East Nanjing Rd and the Bund. The shortcut alley to E Nanjing Rd looks a bit dodgy, especially at night as it has few street lights, but we were totally safe. The alley also has some corner shops which is easy for snacks. We took cabs everywhere because they are incredibly cheap and available 24/7. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Disapointing Don't believe the name of this hotel, it may be on a riverside but isn't on the Bund. Its about 10 minutes walk away. We stayed for 4 days.The room would of been ok, all the normal amenities but the carpet was stained and flithy which was very offputting. Everything else was clean.Breakfast was served on the top floor which had a fantastic view but the buffet itself was disappointing. Limited choice, which wasn't replenished and barely warm. I decided to skip the buffet and go to the egg station, big mistake! The chef had no idea how to cook an omlette and I got a pile of seperate bits of yolk and white. The fried egg was no better, burnt on the bottom but not even warm on the top. There is a cafe on the ground floor which does basic snacks which was better but at an extra cost. We skipped breakfast and ate out after trying breakfast and never tried an evening meal.The reception staff were pleasant and helpful, writing down destinations and getting taxis etc.To sumarise, this isn't a horrific hotel but I wouldn't go back, I think there are better options in Shanghai. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Would NOT stay here again Avoid this hotel at all costs!The service desk personnel, except for the trainees, were awful: I was told that last tourist street map was given to the person immediately in front of me only to witness the same map provided to another patron just two minutes later. Another woman in our party, who spoke fluent mandarin, went to the front desk to exchange currency, at first only the large bills were provided to her. She then asked about the balance and Ms Chrise Wang, the front desk attendant, said that she would provide the balance after our friend signed the receipt. Our friend signed the receipt and Ms Wang proceeded to short change her again!! Our friend summoned the day manager to correct the problem – useless: Our friend did not receive the balance due to her and Ms Wang only signed the customer receipt and conveniently did not sign the hotel copy of receipt. We checked out after the second night instead of staying for the third.Except for the lobby, our hotel room and the interior were worn far beyond its age of only four years – the graffiti on the on the hotel exterior was the first bad sign. The one public internet computer is shares a fax machine on a crowded counter behind the concierge – no privacy and it cost 1 Yuan/minute. The hotel is also quite removed from Nanjing Road and the other clean westernized hotels.Our hotel experiences really took away from our overall enjoyment of Shanghai. We regret not having to check out some of the other tripadvisor reviews of this hotel - we would not have chosen this location. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Fantastic hotel great location Great hotel, thumbs up here.This hotel is approximately 50mins from airport to hotel. Give or take the traffic can be a nightmare.Reception staff are really friendly and the service was with a smile cant fault it.The lifts were in working order, my room had a queen size bed, the bathroom was great had internet access if you needed it (must have your own notebook to do this) downstairs you had the chance to go to the business room if you needed the internet).My view out of the hotel was partial river and the other half was facing another apartment block. Push the blinds accross!! Great Location this hotel is approx 10 mins from Nanjing road shopping district. walk straight down the road and your in heaven!!So many shops !! it is seriously a shoppers paradise. One thing to be careful about is you will find many locals selling items which are either fakes or try to persuade to go down dodgy alley ways, consider this a warning whatever you do say NO. By agreeing to go with them, you are not thinking of your safety. There are many pick pockets and theives around nanjing road make sure you have a shoulder bag around the front of you. If you have a backpack make sure it is at the front of you at all times.This hotel was very handy and warned us about this problem that happens in the shanghai area. They were truely out there to help us.Breakfast is western size, a huge variety of cheeses and breads was in love with it!!!This was my favourite hotel in Shanghai, i could stay here again.I rate this hotel as an 4 star. "
the bund riverside hotel ,Great location and facilities We had been to Shanghai in the previous 12 months so were better prepared this time to select a hotel in the best location to optimise our 4 day stay. We were not disappointed with the Bund Riverside.After 15 hours travel the spacious area of our suite (Room 1218) was most welcoming. The huge king size bed had beautiful bed linen and although the mattress was very hard (it seems the norm for China) we both had a great sleep each night.The extra space was a bonus and the huge windowsills were great to dry our washing!!The bathroom was quite luxurious and the 4 bath towels in the room each day was an added bonus when you need to wash your hair. The shower nozzle was great and easy to adjust. There was plenty of room on the vanity unit to leave both sponge bags spread out. The bath was huge and there was plenty of room to soak after a hard day sightseeing.There was a good size television in both the bedroom and the sitting room. Controls were easy to work out and in addition to the Chinese channels there was also BBC World and CNN. There was a large flatscreen computer on the desk in the sitting room and it was easy to connect to broadband (after the willing assistance of 3 staff - the cord wasn't plugged in!!) Connection was 100Y for 24 hours. There was a bad stain on the carpet - it looks as if someone had spilt red wine. The whole carpet in fact looked as if it needed a good shampoo.Breakfast was included as part of our tarrif and there was an excellent selection of Asian and Western food. The egg chef cooked a great omlette while you waited. I still cant quite get used to other diners smoking while they eat at the adjoining table. We also had lunch in the cafe near reception - nice but quite expensive in comparison to other meals we had across the city.The location was what attracted us to the hotel in the first place and we were not disappointed. It was only a 5 minute walk through to the eastern end of the Nanjing Road shopping mall and the Nanjing Metro Station and a 15 minute stroll to the Bund. Although it was quite dark around the hotel at night and there was nothing open we felt very safe at all times.I would be quite happy to stay here again. Can't comment on the standard rooms and although the suite was expensive ($A245 per night bed and breakfast) it was a luxury I would be quite happy to repeat. 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Run down but cheap The location is very good and the price is OK too. However it's an old hotel and the rooms are small and run down.My room was also next to the lift and quite smelly. I found it unusual that they charge (hefty) for broadband internet use, which is usually free in China.I would probably not stay again. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Location Location Location! We concluded our 2 week sightseeing tour of China with a stay at the Riverside Bund. Our time in Shanghai included a day of leisure on our own and the hotel's location was perfect from the vantage of getting around easily (especially since the days before National Hoiday made getting a taxi impossible). Just a few minute walk to Nanjing Road, a happening 24/7 and an easy walk to People's Park (Shangahi Museum, Urban Planning Center) and the Bund, a great place for dinner), For the more adventurous, a walk across a nearby bridge, finds you in an where the locals shop. So, something for everyone a convenient walk away!We stayed in a room on the 15th floor with one of the best views of the city. Imagine our delight at seeing a fireworks display on the Bund from the comfort of our own room on two successive nights! We found the room to be very comfortable and the beds a little softer (more western style) than some of the other hotels in which we stayed. Breakfast , while a more limited buffet, included custom omelets and soft, freshly baked rolls, reminiscent of home.Overall, the hotel was a very nice end of our trip! "
the bund riverside hotel ,great location My husband and I are both travel agents and have stayed in many hotels around the world. This wasn't our favourite but it did have it's good points.The location is excellent - 5 min walk to Nanjing Road where there is plenty of shopping and underground stations. One stop on the underground to the other side of the river to get you to the TV toweretc. There are also 2 mini-marts close by to get snacks and cheap bottled water etc.The room was good as well - good size and the bathroom was a good size as well - only shower no bath.We found the beds the whole way through China to be very hard - this was not much different.Our only 2 issues were the staff. At breakfast they were not very attentive and the front counter - at concierge asked for a map and he had no idea what I had asked for - check in staff were fine though. 
the bund riverside hotel ,not good Stayed here 9th September. I had previously stayed in hotels in other areas of China and was quite impressed by the quality and standards of the hotels.First impression of this hotel was that it was grand until I reached my room which was quite small and very dull. There was no place to rest a suitcase and no room to walk about. the bathroom was practically in the bedroom.My main irk was that the room was not properly serviced dirty glasses were left and cups not taken away although the bed was made.The srevice at breakfast was no better as the staff seemed to ignore guests.The reception staff were unhelpful and kept carrying out other duties while I was trying to get help from them.If I was going to Shanghai again I would not stay here.The nicest thing about it was the glass lift which we used on a fea occasons!! 
the bund riverside hotel ,"Nice hotel We booked a superior river view no smoking double room for a total cost of 74$ a night.The room, at 11th floor, was fairly large and very clean. The bed was a bit hard but soon find out that it is a standard in China. Toilet supply was fine and there are more items you can buy for a small fee. They supply 2 free small bottles of water every day.There were construction works near the hotel but the room was very silent.We had an impressive view from the window.We took maglev from Pudong airport and then subway to East Nanjing Road. Hotel is about 200 meters from the station. The location is good for Nanjing Road and the Bund, both walking distance. We used the subway to get to the other attractions.The reception was ok, the smiling trainee who received us (supported by a more expert collegue) was very nice and spoke good English. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Sweet Suite was worth the price The Bund Riverside is a 3* hotel within an easy walk of the Bund and Nanjing Lu (pedestrian shopping street). Great location, set in a neighborhood that held no excitement (auto/machine parts) but seemed safe.My sisters and I splurged on a suite on the 17th floor for $150 per night and IT WAS SO WORTH IT. (regular rooms are OK, not large like our suite). Our view to the river and the Bund/Pearl Tower was DEAD ON from the big curved window (with a windowseat) in the bedroom. The suite was a very decent size. The living room was comfortable with a sofa, chair , TV and enough room to put a rollaway bed. (living room view was of the neighborhood).Bedroom held a king sized bed, comfortable enough (firm but not ungiving mattress), nicely decorated, and the large bathroom held a small stall shower and a big soaking tub. Breakfast ($8 per person addt'l) was OK, nothing exciting/nothing Asian, but great views from this top floor of the hotel. Airconditioning never got really cold but we didn't mind, it was cool and comfortable.All in all, a great value for great space. While the lobby is unimpressive (tiny), the staff was helpful (limited English spoken) and polite. Taxis were easy to hail and walking to Nanjing Lu took 5 minutes through the local neighborhood. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Better hotels for your money We stayed here from 7 June 07 for 4 nights. This hotel is quite central, however, you do have to walk up a dark street at night to get to the hotel. I felt perfectly safe as China is a very safe country, however, it could be very intimidating if you were alone. There was also work being carried out on the main pathway, which madeit slightly darker and dingier. The reception area is very nice, the reception staff are friendly, but their English is very poor (although in fairness, my Mandarin isn't as good as their English!) however, the English in Shanghai is very good in comparison to Beijing. Our room was 1101 and was tiny, there was no where to put one suitcase, let alone two. I had mine on the dressing table &amp; my husband had his on top of the chest of drawers as there was literallyno floor space for a suitcase to sit, there wasn't even a suitcase stand in the room. The carpet badly needed replaced, it was 50% covered in very old stains. After the first night in the room at a scorching 27C, I spoke to reception in the morning to report a fault with the air con. They said they would have it sorted for us coming back that night, however, when we returned the thermostat had been turned up to 25C, so I put it right back down again, but the room was no cooler. I went down to reception to report it again &amp; someone came up &amp; 'fixed' it. The following morning after another sleepless night I went and spoke to the manager. She claimed it was to save energy the rooms wouldn't get any cooler than the outside temperature! She agreed to allow us to move rooms as a bigger room would allow the air to circulate better. Our second room 1318, was slightly bigger, although not much cooler but their was space for at least one suitcase on the floor, however, this floor was also filthy. Other than the carpet, the room was fairly clean. The hotel also have a board up with the exchange rates, however they don't exchange travellers cheques, they will only give you Yaun from a credit card payment! Every other hotel in Shanghai exchanges travellers cheques for their guests except this one. The location was quite handy, and the hotel was cheap, however, I wouldn't stay here again. It was a 2 min walk to Nanjing Road and 5 min walk to The Bund &amp; the underground. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Good combination of price and quality We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in May 2007 . It is not cheap according to Chinese standard fares, but it is worth spending money. Great location, that allows you to reach main tourist destinations in just a few minutes, nice window view of the city (we lived on the 16th flow). Rooms are rather big, well decorated and clean. The breakfast is rather expensive and it may well be skipped, but for those who want to drink a cup of coffee overlooking the river and skyscrapes - come to breakfast room at the 18th floor. The plus is that they serve european breakfast and have nice juices.Be aware that if you haven't paid in advance for the hotel, they will ask you for the deposit (the sum of the whole payment). When you check out they give it back or change the necessary sum of them.Look carefully at the service tax. It is 15% there and is not inluded in the room fare. At least we reserved the room under this condition.On the whole, the hotel is great! Nice for business and holidays.And increadibly cheap comparing to such level of european hotels. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Value hotel This is a value hotel, you get what you paid for. Nothing fancy, just O.K. decent sized rooms,O.K. lobby, hallways are darkwood paneld, the beds are hard, The carpet had some stains on it. The soap and shampoos are not individual sized, just a built in in the shower, also there is a fee for all their amenities, the toothbrush, comb etc in the bathroom are not included, there is an addtional charge. The front desk speaks minimal English, the area is safe, not tourist shopping, this is the area for industrial supply stores. 10 minute walk to the Qipu shopping mall. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Average but inexpensive hotel Average but relatively inexpensive (for Shanghai standards) hotel a few minutes walking distance north of the East Nanjing Road. The neighbourhood of the hotel consists almost exclusively of stores selling auto parts, tools, plumbing supplies etc. These shops close early in the day, and then the streets surrounding the hotel get pretty dark and somewhat spooky. However, the streets are busy during the day, and the East Nanjing Road with its bright shopping malls is only minutes away.The staff is friendly, and our room on the 16th floor was clean but somewhat small. The bathroom was large with a huge shower cabin. We were upgraded to river view free of charge (river view rooms are considerably more expensive than the standard city view rooms) and had a good view over the Huangpu river, the Pudong skyline with the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the Suzhou creek.The breakfast buffet is OK but nothing to phone home about (bread rolls, butter/jam, eggs, bacon, some vegetables, noodles, fruit, congee). Coffee in the lobby cafe is quite expensive; we payed RMB 88 for two mediocre Cappucini. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"never again!!! as simple as this: we were in our room at 10pm when a noise started. After dealing half an hour with reception, they told us that the carpet in the restaurant in the highest floor was being replaced, &quot;but they will finish at midnight&quot;! well, after complaining without result, they finish at 1:30am. The morning after, the manager of the hotel offered us 20USD because it wasn´t a big deal, then they didn´t make noise the whole night.... in a very unpolite and despective behaviour. Well, the real problem is that they don´t care, and you can complain further, so be lucky in your stay or you will regret for hours having chosen this hotel. In my opinion is better to book an international hotel in Pudong or somewhere else near subway, which works perfectly and it´s very easy to get through.I needed to share my worst experience ever in an hotel. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Top value for money After a lot of research I found this hotel to offer the best value / location ratio in Shanghai. It is extremely central but only cost US$70 per night. Located around 5 minutes walk from the Bund, 5 minutes from Nanjing Road and its metro station, this is a brilliant location. Much more preferable to being stuck out in Pudong in the Hyatt or Shangri-La.The hotel has a very helpful concierge and nice cafe for breakfasts. The room was a very respectable size with massive shower cubicle and all mod cons. I will definitely stay here next time I'm in Shanghai. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great place to stay This was my last night in China after enduring some pretty ordinary service and accomodation but I honestly thought that this place was great.Moderately priced, beautifully appointed, perfectly located for the Bund, Nanjing Rd and the Metro.Would definitely stay there again. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Nice Hotel good location This hotel is fine the view from some of the hotel windows is absolutely fantastic (see photo), the bar on the top floor lacks any atmosphere but we were in a big group so we used to go into one of the private bars and enjoy the scenery. The location is fine (altough it is a good 7 minute walk to the Bund). It is definitely well worth it particularly at night for the lights and also in the morning to see everyone doing their exercises. It's about 10 minutes walk to the Nanjing Road, which is great for shopping and once again the lights at night are fantastic. Shanghai is an amazing city so Enjoy!!! "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Great Hotel Spent 4 nights at the Bund Riverside, We found the position was excellent, just 2 streets away from the hub, but easy walking distance. About a fifteen minute walk to the Bund.The staff were very pleasant and helpful, reasonable amount of english spoken. We asked for an upgrade and got it! The room was well appointed and very clean and comfortable. The exchange rate in the hotel was as good.Would stay again at this hotel without hesitation. "
the bund riverside hotel ,"Very nice hotel This hotel is also known as the XinXieTong Hotel and the New Xie Tong Hotel.It has a great location 5 mins walk from Nanjing Road and 10 mins walk to The Bund, admittedly your 5 mins are a walk through a street with workshops and locals working on tools and machines, it is safe just not very glamorous!The hotel lobby is small with a few seats to relax and a bar off to the right, it is bright and clean, with plenty of marble, they turn the lights down at 11.30pm!There are 4 lifts, the one in front of you when you walk towards them is a scenic one, with a great view over the suzhou creek.The hotel corridors are very swish and stylish, the room also is of very good quality, a good size, even though I guess we were in the cheapest rooms, we had 2 double beds, which were comfortable and good linens, 2 chairs to sit and a table, TV, inroom safe, kettle, tea and a large windowsill that 2 people could completely sit on and look out over the Suzhou creek and Shanghai. Also in the room are slippers, plenty of towels and dressing gowns. The bathroom was massive (for a bathroom) well stocked, there was alsorts of items in the room all with a price on, if you wanted them. There were 2 complimentary bottles of water in the bathroom.The restaurant/breakfast room was on the 18th floor, with a fine view over to Pudong. Breakfast consisted of cereals, milk, yoghurts, fruit, cut up bananas, bread and a toaster, cooked items and a chef cooking eggs, as well as Chinese items. The room wasn't massive, so not sure what would happen if it got busy.All in all I thought this was a very nice hotel "

Our room was clean, and had the usual amenities; we were happy to find bathrobes and slippers. The only negative was that the coffee maker didn't work, and wasn't fixed, even though we had alerted the staff. Views of Pudong and the Suzhou canal were spectacular from our tenth floor room. Breakfast in the top floor restaurant was buffet-style, with a good mix of western and eastern items, including an omlette bar. The hotel is well-located, being steps from Nanjing shopping street, and a metro stop. "

the eton hotel ,Great Hotel - Highly recommended Stayed here in July 2009 for 3 nights on a business trip. The room is spacious and clean. The bathroom is beautiful with great view. Excellent service. 
the eton hotel ,"Great Hotel I loved this hotel. Very modern with a great room and fantastic views of the Mao tower or the river , depending on your room location. I stayed 3 times in 2 weeks, so I say 3 different rooms. All were to a very high standard. The subway is just across the road and taxis are cheap so the location should not be a problem for tourists. Breakfast was also very good, with a good choice of &quot;european&quot; food. "
the eton hotel ,"very happy with choice We arrived very late but service was excellent. Although we did not plan to have breakfast, we decided to try it. It was amazing! Something for all tastes. We had a standard room but there was nothing else to wish for. A wonderful wetroom! View onto the river.On the other side is the Metro and also busconnections into all areas. Wonderful! But even taking a taxi doesn't cost the world. A great hotel that is a real bargin for the price!We used the swimming pool and the sauna and enjoyed it immensly. "
the eton hotel ,Excellent facilities - friendly staff I stayed here for 8 days when I was visiting family - Hotel is very nice but a little bit out of the way. Saying that the underground is directly across the road from here and it is by far the best way to get round the city. The underground is very modern with a train every few minutes- most we had to wait was a maximum of 5 minutes. If you do not want to use the Underground you can use taxi's which are also very cheap. A run into the city centre was only about 1200RMB ( about £1.20) Hotel itself is very nice with a lovely swimming pool and Gym / steam rooms. there is a choice of 3 restuarants - we visited the Cantonese one in the restuarant and were not really impressed with the food but it was probably because it was different than what we are used to in a Cantonese restuarant at home. The staff in the hotel were very good - room service etc was quick and affordable- Rooms are nice with a glass partition between the bathroom and the bedroom so if you want you can lie in the bath and watch the Tv (Movie channels &amp; news channels in English )I would certainly go back here but it is a little bit quiet just outside the hotel but 5 mins in a taxi and you are in the financial district where there is plent life. 
the eton hotel ,Great hotel but out of town Lovely hotel with fabulous rooms .Lobby bar a bit lacking in atmosphere.Good breakfastLovely swimming pool.Long way from any attractions but near the metro 
the eton hotel ,"Excellent 5 star hotel - poor location The reason the Eton gets rated so highly is because its an excellent 5-star hotel at a 3-star price. Many of the reviewers are unaccustomed to it and are bowled over by the experience. And the experience is good. The problem is the location. If you need to be there then that's OK, but otherwise it's a long way from the centre. Wanting some beer and snacks I asked directions and headed off: after 5 mins I had passed empty offices, empty plots, two very seedy brothels and a run down looking noodle place, before finding the &quot;supermarket&quot; stocked with out of date strange brands and very dimly lit - like something from Moscow circa 1991. All very un-Shanghai. Yes the underground is opposite the door, but those trains only travel every 20 mins most of the time, and you will always have to change at the next stop. Going out to a bar? - that'll be 15mins in a taxi. The whole area is being rebuilt - streets being torn up and many building sites - but even when they've finished the Eton will be in a poor location. "
the eton hotel ,"Excellent hotel - too far off the action Excellent 5 star hotel located in Pudong. Outstanding room. Unfortunately, the hotel is located approximately one mile from the tourist attractions in Pudong. Not much in the hotel neighbourhood due to construction ongoing on Pudong Avenue. Metro (subway) located across the street. "
the eton hotel ,"best hotel of shanghai!!!! All in the hotel is superb...EXcellent pool, incredible rooms with 3 lcds TV, incredible views and location, great lobby , enormous buffet breakfast, excellent service....It has the best executive lounge that I have ever been.I will remember always how smells the hotel, it is a mix of roses and orchyds....absolutelly incredible...A paradise on earth.... "
the eton hotel ,"Very Good A very nice hotel. The room looked new and elegant. Service was good and breakfast was good with a large selection.Location just ok as it was a bit far from the citycentre, but taxi is cheap so we didnt mind. "
the eton hotel ,"Very good will be staying here from now on I travel to Shanghai for work about 7-8 times a year. I usually stay at The Barony which is just down the road from The Eton. I got a really great rate at The Eton and was able to stay here this trip...what a difference between the 2 hotels! The room was great, the gym and pool were great. The spa was a little on the pricey side but I always go to the DragonFly Spa just a 10 minute walk from here on ChangYi rd. I ordered room service a couple of times...it was good. The breakfast was great, lot's to choose from. The only thing that I didn't like was that they apply a 15% surcharge to everything here.Other than that, no complaints. Whenever I go back to Shanghai I will be staying at The Eton from now on. "
the eton hotel ,"Always great I travel to Shanghai every 3 months and The Eton is always where I end up. From my experience, there are no other hotels in Shanghai (Puxi or Pudong) that offers a better or similar combination of price and quality.I typically stay in an Executive room, which includes a great quality breakfast on the Executive floor (with a great view of the city) and free internet access, amongst other things.The staff is very courteous and employees will go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay. While most employees speak some English, communication can be a bit arduous at times. But that is true for all hotels I have been to while in China, including American-owned hotels.The rooms on the Executive Floors are great: very clean, bed is comfortable, work area adequate, nice size LCD TV mounted on the wall. The only complain I have is that the shower pressure is very average.As many people have mentioned, there is a metro station very nearby (less than 5 minutes walk). There are a few corner stores/groceries around if you want to buy your own snacks and save some money. As far as dining goes, you will not find many good restaurants at a walking distance; but a 10 minutes taxi ride will bring to other areas (such as the Times Square), where you have plenty of options for a great dinner. I have tried mainly western-style food from The Eton, and although it was acceptable, there are much better alternatives a few kilometers away. So if you're tired and want to relax, don't worry: ordering room service will be okay. But if you're feeling good, I suggest you go out.I strongly recommend this hotel, and will definitely go back. "
the eton hotel ,Wonderful contemporary luxury hotel Great hotel for business or leisure travel. I have stayed at this hotel 5 times in the last year and the hotel is superb. The rooms are beautiful with great vies of downtown Shanghai. 
the eton hotel ,"Excellent hotel I stayed at this hotel for one night last year for my birthday. We lived about 1 hour away and unfortunately forgot our passport which was obviously a major problem. The staff were extremely helpful and understanding, and let me wait in the executive lounge with free refreshments while we waited to resolve the problem. When we eventually made it to our room, I was very impressed. The bathroom was simply amazing and as we had an executive room we were able to have free refreshments in the lounge whenever we wanted, including cocktails, ice cream and canapes during the cocktail hour. The swimming and spa facilities were also impressive. "
the eton hotel ,"How it could be that someone is positive about this hotel !! My Chinese partner and I did checked in in this hotel and did leave the hotel again within 1 hour. The hotel looks moderate from the outside and the hallway and lobby are looking great; but the staff shows no happynes or willingness to do their job good at all. The bathroom is twice as big as in other hotels and looks fancy but but the left over space in a normal room became so small, that it is giving no space to be to happy in the room itself. Also the room was smelly.In first view the lobby and stairways in the hotel look impressing, but wit a second look, the decoration is a BAD copy of European-like products. Even the furniture and lightning in the rooms itself, it is all missing a good taste and the perfection. After this worce experience, the operator of Hotels.com did advice us to try the Novotel, what was in all aspects of qualitie, service and value for money 10 times better than that lausy Eton Hotel. "
the eton hotel ,"Brilliant! Wonderful hotel, after roughing it for a few weeks backpacking. The service was second to none - special mention to Roland Shi (chief concierge) who helped with arrangements to send a parcel of clothes to the hotel from home - I didn't even have to ask about the parcel when I checked in, it was given to me. The breakfast was all you could want, and the room was fantastic. We took photos of the bathroom for inspiration when we build a new bathroom in our home!! The location is not perfect for tourists, but with taxis so cheap, this should not be an influencing factor when deciding where to stay in Shanghai. "
the eton hotel ,"brilliant! we had a great stay at this hotel and wonderful city. conveniently located in pudong, it was easy to reach to the city centre by taxi and the view of the high rises was just stunning both during the day and at night. in terms of design and decoration, the definite Chinese touch in the hotel is a real charm, especially when it comes to the music. =) the rooms were very spacious and clean with excellent amenities. we had room service once and the food exceeded our expectations given that it was western kind of food that we ordered. i definitely recommend this place! "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel location not so much The hotel in itself is great: all new, beautiful lobby, great spacious rooms with awesome bathrooms. The breakfast buffet also is AMAZING!But, two dark sides: the location first. It is not well located in Shanghai, and even though there is a subway stop right in front of the hotel, as a tourist it was not very convenient. Second, the service. I know this is China but the concierge was bad, the breakfast waiters even worse, and don't even get me started on the service in the cantonese restaurant!But I shouldn't be too picky - this hotel is still a GREAT value for money, with 5* rooms at an affordable price. "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel for the price paid I stayed at this 5 star hotel from April 27th to May 5th 2009. We were 3 people which stayed at the Executive room but were upgraded to the Executive premium room free of charge. Let me begin by mentioning that this in no terms is the most luxuries hotel in Shanghai, this does not mean it is a bad hotel though. This hotel is located in a construction zone due to Expo 2009 being placed in Shanghai, if you want to take the subway to places it is a great location but if you want to be right in the heart of the shopping district you should choose the Le Royal Meridein Shanghai (keep in mind its $1600 more) for our stay so we choose to take the subway to places such as Nanjing Road East which is the biggest shopping district in China, the cost was 4 RMB per person and took around 30 minuites to travel there. Here are the pros and cons of the hotelPros: Hotel price was very decent considering the services that were included. The services were very good buffet breakfast, something called happy hour which goes on from 5pm to 7:30 pm, this happy hour is for executive floor clients and offers all you can eat snaks which we were able to do as our dinner, the drinks are also included on a all you can drink bases, there are various alchol and non alcholic drinks available.The staff are very willing to help considering the lanugage barrier.all in all I would give this hotel 5 stars for value for money, 5 stats for guest services and 5 stars for overall satisfaction.the hotel is great for the bang for the buck, when we reserved our room the hotel had a 30% price reduction through major sites such as travelocity , hotels.ca and expedia.caCons: The room was a bit on the small size, the bathroom was very big but useless big, the tub could accomidate 4 people easily but was not a jacuzi, just a regular huge tub "
the eton hotel ,"tacky stayed there for four nights in april 2009, selected solely on tripadvisor #1 recommendation. i was more than slightly disappointed. it's a good hotel no doubt, but personally i, being in my late 20s, would not rate it anywhere near #1.the view from the 36th floor was nice, the room was super spacious and made with good materials. a tv in the bathroom next to a mirror, and you could see the skyscrapers from the bathtub. we got a smoking room but there was no smell of cigarettes. there was a 7/11 in the same block. downstairs had good wifi that required authentication through a forced redirect page but had all ports open and worked well for free. the atmosphere downstairs was very cheesy, entertainment music played live on grand piano, overpriced white wine and complimentary peanuts you have to pay for. i felt that the staff was hiding behind a fawny &quot;of course sir, yes sir, hello sir&quot; attitude and was not really interested in where we went for dinner and for shopping, etc. an example: after a determined struggle i got the concierge to book us a flight to beijing. given no intervention he would have picked the first on his list despite my special requests. there was a pimp offering his services every night outside the hotel, he was quite persistent even though i told him i'm not interested in his services. he was wearing indoor clothing and emerged out of the blue every time i went to 7/11.this hotel was a good choice for having a nice view at the pudong skyscrapers. there was a metro station right next to the hotel, however the line it was on seemed to be rather peripheric. going anywhere without too much time to spend, you need to take a taxi which will be stuck in the traffic going into a tunnel. it doest cost much but takes your precious time. this is not a downtown hotel from which you can walk to places.that being said, i can recommend this without reservations to those for whom &quot;tacky&quot; and &quot;cheesy&quot; mean &quot;luxurious&quot;. "
the eton hotel ,"Love the Granduer Excellent Location. Its granduer is worth mentioning. Rooms are very comfortable. Indoor swiming pool, spa service, Gym are very well maintained. "
the eton hotel ,"upmarket my husband and I stayed at the Eton for 2 nights in April 2008. The hotel is a lovelyand modern establishment. only negatives was beware of staff at spa. They offeredmore than was on the brochure.. and wanted to be paid privately for extras offered. booked a massage and was informed that this was without oils and was to pay the lady privately if i wanted this. other than this, the facilities such as indoor swimming pool, sauna, etc. was fantastic and well run. The Eton, because of its situation(pudong area) is a bit out of the way but the subway across the street will get you to the centre of shanghai very easily. would i go back? yes, probably "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel+They made me feel at home! Stayed for four weeks on a business trip, which can be quite a long time...but surprise: I loved the view from their rooms, the really spectacular bathrooms (the ones with a round bathtube are like your own little swimmingpool) and their breakfast is great, too. Stayed also in the most-expensive hotels in Shanghai, but the breakfast now disappoints me after my experience in the Eton, where you get top-quality for half the price. Everyone of the staff was really helpful and they were so nice to me. Thank you, I really felt at home! "
the eton hotel ,"A fantastic place to stay in Shanghai The Eton Hotel is one of the better hotels in Shanghai, and is a good value for the money. The lobby and restaurant areas are clean and bright, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful.The included breakfast is a bit more limited than some of the other hotels in the area, but they more than make up for the decreased quantity with very high-quality offerings, which span from traditional Western breakfast options, to regional dishes. The only gripe I could possibly have is that their sushi options are quite meager. Overall, though, it is a great way to start your day.The rooms are very modern and trendy, with a sleek design and very nice amenities. For those who forget their plug adapters, there are even a few North American outlets provided in each room. The view from the rooms is decent, offering a nice view of the downtown area and the river.Finally, the location is very good! While it is a bit removed from the downtown area (1k or so), it is right across the street from the subway, which despite what the locals will tell you, is an extremely easy and efficient way to get around the city, even for those who do not understand Chinese. For those who don't want to brave the subway, there are ample cabs, which can get you pretty much anywhere for very little money. Just have the hotel staff write your destination in Chinese to help ensure you get where you want to go.For business travelers or techies, there is internet service available for purchase, and the speed is great. Access is somewhat less restricted than in other parts of the country, though access to certain liberal-leaning news sites still appears to be blocked.All in all, the Eton is a good value for a good higher-end room in Shanghai! "
the eton hotel ,"bad location; dishonest hotel concierge assisting in taxi stand area hotel itself is clean. we were offered a room with only a single bed when we arrived when we specifically mentioned we wanted two beds when we booked. this was immediately fixed though. breakfast is good.what we didnt like was the one staff who was dishonest to us. a bell boy named chan who was assisting in the taxi cab queue right outside the hotel. as the hotel is far from almost everything taking the taxi was our means of transportation esp since we were travelling with small children. he convinced us to take two cabs instead of one insisting that cabs cannot take in 3 adults and two kids. we later found out that we could take one cab if we let the children sit on our lap. for the amount of money we paid, i think we could have opted for another hotel on the other side of pudong area. "
the eton hotel ,"Not great Stayed at the Eton for a week in a club room. The Eton suffered from the same problems as all the hotels we stayed in over a month in China, except the problems seemed to be worse at the Eton. This was surprising for Shanghai, where I expected higher standards than elsewhere in hotels catering to the international market.First, the good:The room was modern and fresh, with nice touches like a tv in the bathroom. It was on the small side (Hong Kong size) but this was not a problem. The fit-out of the place seemed a little cheap, but was ok.The pool area was fabulous - nicer than in most top end hotels. The gym was also well-equipped.Breakfast was excellent, the best we encountered in China (although fresh fruit was lacking and the staff were surly - more about that in a minute).Now, the bad:The staff. It seems ridiculous that, everywhere in China, the housekeeping staff are hugely friendly and courteous, and the rest of the staff are either stand-offish or rude. The Eton was no exception, although the reception, breakfast and lobby lounge staff deserve particular mention for rudeness. Even when they did manage to crack a thin smile, the staff were just plain unhelpful. Some examples - the concierge was often nowhere to be seen (and pretty unhelpful too!) so we asked someone at reception to write down a street name for us in Chinese. This would have taken 2 seconds but we were redirected to the (empty) concierge desk. The person in charge of the lobby lounge (where the club drinks and canapes were served) seemed reluctant to serve us and was completely unsmiling and prone to snapping when she did. The list goes on. We visited in January and, unfortunately, our stay coincided with the maintenance and spring cleaning weeks of the year and most of the hotel facilities were closed. We were not informed of this when we booked and we certainly did not get a knockdown rate, so it seemed a little poor. On a practical level, this meant no club lounge (drinks and canapes in the lobby), no business centre for the first half of our stay, and a fairly whopping amount of building noise in our room during the day. The hot water system seemed to be on the blink - the water had to run for 10 minutes or more (I'm not joking) before it would get hot, and even then it wasn't piping hot. Since they turned the water off a few times during our stay perhaps they were fixing it along with everything else.A word on the location - we went with our eyes open to the location and I certainly wouldn't be put off by it. The subway is across the road and taxis to Puxi can be quick depending on the driver. And this is the big catch - taxi drivers in Shanghai seem to have a hell of a time keeping up with all the road closures due to construction of subway lines, buildings, new roads etc, so a taxi ride can easily turn into an hour going round and round in circles if you're not careful. We usually take the subway during the day and taxis at night in big cities but by the end of the week we avoided taxis at all costs. The subway is just easier. There are nooks and crannies in Pudong worth exploring but the whole area around the hotel is basically a construction site at the moment, and a very muddy one at that, so we gave up on walking around.Conclusion - not the most expensive hotel in Shanghai which explains some of the shortcomings. However, the service could easily be improved and apparently this wouldn't cost a thing since the lowest paid staff were fabulous and very friendly. The price of the hotel is comparable to those in many international cities, but the experience is not. "
the eton hotel ,"Loved it I booked this hotel through Orbitz- received a 3 star price for a 5 star hotel. It was awesome. The hotel was really, really nice. When I got there they were not able to accommodate my request for non-smoking room so I ended up taking a smoking room on a smoking floor- you could not tell it was smoking. There was no smell neither in the room nor on the whole floor. Just amazing. The only downfall was the communication with the staff was a bit tough (maybe it just the culture) but I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in the Pudong area. One advisory- do not plan on eating at the hotel b/c all establishments are really expensive. However, there are many food options in the area within 10-15 min walk as well as as some &quot;special massage&quot; places. P.S. All photos from the hotel website are accurate. Rooms look exactly the same as they advertise. "
the eton hotel ,"Comfort First Class Service To Die For Breakfast Buffet We stayed at the Eton for a conference at the Int'l Convention Center for five nights in December 08. The check in was smooth and all service people were highly attentive. We were going to bring up our luggage on our own, but the bellman rushed to take it away as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were greeted with a friendly &quot;hello&quot; whenever we crossed paths with a service person. Very knowledgeable about the area and helpful with calling taxis, etc.The location isn't too central (about a 10 minute taxi ride to the convention center for $2) but there is a subway station directly across the street and the subway system is somewhat easy to understand. There are a couple of nice restaurants/pubs/cafes/shopping in walking distance. There are English translations (some lost in translation) everywhere.We asked for a room with a view and were given just that...although I'm sure most rooms have a view since the Eton's rooms are on the 26th floor on up. Rooms are spacious and modern with two flatscreen TVs (one in the bathroom). Beds are really comfortable and we referred to the bath as a mini pool. Complimentary bottled water is in the room. The breakfast buffet (OH BOY!) is definitely the highlight. Many choices, including Western, Japanese, Chinese, wonderful bakery items. I wish I could have just one more breakfast there...Highly recommended choice for what should be a five star hotel. "
the eton hotel ,"Unbelievable Hotel--So-so location I stayed here while I attended a conference at the Shanghai International Conference Centre which is only a 10 minute taxi ride (which is cheap: $2USD). Great location for the conference, but not so great for sightseeing although the subway is directly across the street. This hotel is EXCELLENT! Very new--clean, bright and comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with lots of english channels, but no pay on demand movies. Room service was excellent (although pricey). I booked through expedia for a rate &lt; $150 USD /night and loved it there. I highly recommend going with the access to the lounge and executive floors--the lounge is great--lots of food, snacks and drinks so we never had to worry about getting drinks before we came home (i.e. water, beer, soda, liquor). Also, this deal included breakfast--wow! what a buffet! all types of food--american, asian style and done VERY well. The croissants rivaled those we have had in France. The bacon and eggs are also terrific. Then you can also have what looks like chinese dinner! Lastly, our package included free internet with the executive floors (38-40).Overall, great place, locaton is good for going to the SICC conf centre, but only so-so for touring. 2 nights we had troubles getting a cab back because they were not servicing the Pudong area due to their restricted license (I think?). but the subway is cheap and very accessible. I would definitely stay here again for the 5 star quality. "
the eton hotel ,"My new favorite hotel in Shanghai I was originally booked at a hotel nearby, but on my arrival day they had a fire and I was rebooked at the Eton Hotel down the road. Lucky me.The location is not as bad as some reviewers make it sound, a taxi to the Bund is less than 5.00, you can walk to the shopping area around the Intercontinental Hotel in 20 minutes. And the views from all rooms are incredible. Floor to ceiling windows will do that!The room is excellent, I would say that the bed beats the &quot;heavenly bed&quot; at the Westin. Soaker tub with a view and a TV in the bathroom. Buffet is up to snuff with the St. Regis and most other international chains in Shanghai. Can't complain about that.Adjacent to the lobby is a coffee shop called Costa Coffee, a Starbucks knock off, in case that you are getting tired of buffet breakfast.Most definitely a great hotel and my new choice in Shanghai.Common areas and fitness centre are clean, inviting and the staff does pay attention. "
the eton hotel ,"Extremely Dissappointing After reading the reviews for this hotel, I was expecting to be at least mildly impressed. I was not. I got their using the subway and lugged 3 bags to the front door. There were doormen their, but no one opened the door and no one help me with the bags. I had booked the prepaid rates and attempted to put the membership# from their loyalty club on the stay; they wouldn't do it. The english of the lady would check me in was pretty good, so that was a plus. The carpet in the hallways are old and worn and the rooms could use a renovation. The bathroom were OK, but they too could use an update.I ate at the restaurant and the selection was pretty good. One slightly annoying thing was that they kept playing a cheesy muzak, truncated version of Jackson Browne's &quot;The Road&quot; over and over. I guess that's one way to keep guests from overstaying their welcome at the buffett!After several days of eating asian food, I asked the conceirge for a good western restaurant in the area, he recommended Hooter's!All in all, I expected this to be a good hotel after seeing that it had the number position on trip advisor. In my opinion it should be much lower. "
the eton hotel ,"Nice hotel- would stay in a different location This is a lovely hotel, and the staff are exceptionally helpful and attentive, however the on the day we checked in we were assigned a twin room with 2 single beds when we had booked a double. We were given an upgrade to a larger room with a better view, but if we had been stuck in the first room, it would have been a much more disappointing experience (terrible view of shipyards etc, when you are paying a premium price for that sort of accommodation). The location was our main gripe though, as we didn't realise that although taxis are cheap and reliable (they drive VERY differently- i.e crazy!!!) and I would much have preferred to stay on the BUND or on the other side of the river. There isn't anything in Pudong except shipyards and although the Jin mao tower and sheraton are there they are much closer to the river than the Eton. Every time you want to get anywhere you have to go in a taxi/train under the tunnel to the side of the river where everything is. Next time I would definitely stay in the french concession/bund area- the hotel itself is fine though, but the location is pretty inconvienient and boring if you want to experience the night life and markets etc. "
the eton hotel ,"Best Hotel In Pudong/Shanghai I have stayed at this hotel for a few months this year, and will not stay at another hotel now in Shanghai. This hotel is the best around. The staff is excellent, so attentive, friendly, and willing to help you with whatever you need. The accomodations are top notch,and if you get a room with the view of the skyline of Pudong/Shanghai, you will be astounded. The rooms are really quite posh, with large tubs (most of them at least), comfortable beds, large TVs, and overall, just a feeling that it's better than whatever other choice you might have made. The service in the lobby is at times a bit much, but that's also just due to you being in a western hotel in China. The location is very nice, right across the street from the subway (line 4, pudong ave), and there are a plethora of taxis. The restaurants in the hotel are what you would expect in a hotel restaraunt, whatever that is. Behind the hotel is quite a pleasant little garden area that you won't think much of until you realize that there really isn't a lot of grass in Shanghai, and that it's a nice secluded area to remove yourself form the hectic-ness of 2 blocks away. It's a block away from the ferry across the Huangpu, and a pretty simple subway ride from the Maglev station.There's a coffee shop next door that caters to the business crowd, and a wine store that appears to have a good selection. You're a short walk or taxi ride from the major mall in Pudong, and all the touristy stuff that side of the river is famous for. You won't be let down at this hotel, I highly recommend it!!!! "
the eton hotel ,"What a Gem of a place ! Stayed In Shanghai many times and this place really offers not only the best value for money but great rooms and service as welll. Rooms really well appointed, roomy 2 flatscreen, TV's and spotlessly clean. My only single gripe was that they charged a small fortune for internet access. My tip here is to go downstairs into the adjoining costa coffe place where you get free wifi. The cost of the coffee alone only gave you 10mins internet access in your room. Also if you hunt around enough on the net you can always pick a room up there for $150 ish. Try either C Trip.com or otel.com Oddly enough these 2 seem to swing from being the most expensive to cheapest every other month.Have already booked to stay here again and this place will now be my regular stopover in Shanghai. Only downside at present (Oct08) there are roadworks outside which makes access a but tricky for taxis but you could not hear any other the works in your rooms. "
the eton hotel ,"excellent hotel Stayed for 4 nights recently and decided to book an executive room which although a little more expensive than standard room gave me free breakfast in executive floor lounge and also free internet access. Was upgraded to junior suite which was excellent- very comfortable, flat screen TVs in abundance, good desk etc. There are some roadworks outside hotel at present which are not noisy but make access a little difficult for taxi's - make sure that you have hotel address in Pinyin as 2 drivers did not know location of hotel. Very good gym and pool which are hardly used at all, Cantonese restaurant OK, I found all staff to be very helpful and friendly-will definitely stay there again "
the eton hotel ,"Not quite a 5-star just ok for service This hotel works OK for a business hotel. Though the location is not very close to anything. I don't know who or how the label 5-star gets decided but I would question that.I was disappointed because my shower kept clogging up. And I contacted the front-desk 3 different times and finally gave up. Supposedly they had fixed it after the 2nd contact, but it was NOT fixed. Tried to explain to them the problem, but no luck.Didn't expect to stand in a puddle of water while showering at a 5-star hotel. And did not want to stick my hands in the drain. I even explained the problem to the manager afterwards, but that didn't help either... not sure he understood everything.The staff speaks english but just enough to give you a welcome. Any deeper issues to be communicated - well good luck getting through. "
the eton hotel ,"The best hotel I ever stayed at! This is a fantastic hotel! About 4 or 5 restaurants, a bit pricy so we didn't eat in them. But the room rates were so cheap for a 5 star hotel - £65 per room/night! Bargain! It was my birthday and the hotel surprised me with a delcious free birthday cake! How lovely! The spa is excellent! Great pool and lovely treatments, well worth forking out for! Oh and all the bathrooms have city views, ie. glass walls through to the bed room, but don't worry, there are roller blinds for your privacy! :) "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel good service and somewhere I enjoy staying I've been staying at the Eaton Hotel Shanghai since May, and have stayed an average of 4 or 5 nights each time I have been here.I've been in a variety of different rooms, and different floors, and found the hotel to be consistently good. The hotel is modern, with an arty feel to it, and boasts some of the best views of Shanghai.The rooms are comfortable and modern, and have some interesting bathrooms. I've had walk-in showers with full views across the city - large bathtubs with views, and this time around, a bath that would accommodate 2 or more people, with a frosted glass surround. The beds are proper King Size - meaning that I can sleep in comfort despite being 196cm tall, and there's little noise to disturb you either.Breakfast is excellent, with a wide range of foods to choose from, although at peak times it can be a little chaotic and finding a table can be slightly self service. Try and get in before the crowds, and it really is first class though. I have not tried the other restaurants, but the rooms service is good, especially the Cantonese Style Wanton Noodle Soup, which at $11 USD is expensive for Wanton Noodle Soup, but not for a five star hotel anywhere! There are plenty of wontons and plenty of noodles too.The internet is great - works well, and has an excellent multi-lingual 24/7 helpdesk if you need it. None of that nasty free internet that doesn't work here - you pay, but you know why you are paying.Nice touches include the shopping bags provided for you in the wardrobe, and proper suit hangers too.I love this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone. The location is not the best for a tourist perhaps, but as taxis seem to only cost 11 - 33 CNY regardless of where you go, I would not let this put me off. "
the eton hotel ,"sterile business hotel good for business trips - avoid if you're a tourist We stayed at the Eton with two kids (14,16) for two nights. The hotel is located in Pudong directly at a subway station. Though we had booked two non-smoker rooms we were directed to smelly smokers rooms with ashtrays still present in the room (though a non smoker sign was at the door). After complaining about this the reception offered to set up the room as a non-smoker room - by removing the ashtrays. Great idea! According to the reception other non smoking rooms are not available. We insisted on changing the rooms and - what a wonder - finally got a non smoking room on another level of the hotel.Rooms are just great - marvelous view over Pudong or the river. The bathromm takes half of the room, offering whirl pool and other nice gimmicks. The staff is between indifferent and snobby. "
the eton hotel ,"Excellent Shanghai hotel In the past, when I have travelled to Shanghai, I have stayed at the Shangra-La. For this latest trip, I decided to find a hotel that was lower priced and still accommodating to the international business traveller. Based on reviews at TripAdvisor, I booked five nights in an executive room at the Eton. This hotel is a gem! Check-in was fast, the base executive room was very clean and modern with more than enough space for my needs. Internet sped was good. The executive floor was quiet and the breakfast and evening appetizers were very good. The steaks at the Chicago Steakhouse were OK and the Eton Cafe was excellent. The staff spoke very adequate English, the concierge was extremely helpful for arranging taxis and transportation. There is a subway station across the street from the hotel entrance for visitors who want to sightsee in Shanghai. The exercise room had most of the equipment that you would find at any exercise club, including treadmills, steppers, weight machines and some free weights. Overall, the hotel is well maintained and the room temperature was comfortable even when the outside temperature was in the high 90's. At this writing, there is a fair amount of street reconstruction going on in the area which delayed traffic a little, but overall it was not a problem. At half the price of the Shangra-La, this hotel is an excellent value for a 4 star+ hotel. I will be returning to the Eton on my next trip to Shanghai. "
the eton hotel ,"Nice hotel but #1 in Shanghai? Stayed here for a two week break in April of 2008.Booking:My girlfriend happened to have a project in Shanghai that coincided with my holidays so I decided to take them visiting her in Shanghai. If I was going alone I probably would have considered the Eton since it is #1 on tripAdvisor but my decision was made easy as this was where her company put her.Check-In/Check-Out:Didn't have to do anything as I arrived after my gf and left before her. So no comments in that regard. One comment was that I booked the hotel car to take me back to the airport which was definitely worth it. Much nicer than a cab.Room:The room was just a standard room but we were lucky enough to have a view of Pudong which was better than the other views. Everything in the room seemed clean and new. The bed was great, and the circular bathtub is a novelty that was actually used one night. TV &amp; Internet were more than acceptable.Service:Service on the whole was great. The concierge was always helpful for restaurant recommendations, tours, etc. and on the few occasions we had a language issue, they quickly went and got someone who understood. The cleaning staff were great, doing a very thorough job of cleaning the room. It happened to be my gf's birthday while we were there and I had arranged for flowers to be delivered. The flowers were beautiful and very timely with their delivery. That evening when we returned from dinner there was a cheesecake, (not just a piece!) waiting for her from the hotel.Location:This is the area that makes me question how the Eton can consistently be rated #1 in the city. As previous posters have debated, the location is a point of contention. It is basically just on the outside of the downtown business center of Pudong, and as such, it's not overly practical to walk to anywhere. As mentioned there is a subway station just across the street and the subway turns out to be incredibly convenient if you're going somewhere near a stop. Taxi's are also readily available and use their meters always, (only once in all of Shanghai did I have a cabbie tell me his meter was broken), unlike Malaysia, Bangkok, Philippines, etc. where you have to argue a rate, as a previous poster tried to mumble out. Also, they are incredibly inexpensive. However; if you're taking a cab and want to go into the center of Shanghai, (read: across the river), you're looking at a 30 minute ride during peak vehicle times, which can be a pain. Being a tourist, I much would have rather stayed right on Nanjing road, or near the french concession. there are high-end hotels such as le Meridian, Ritz-Carlton, etc. in that area so there wouldn't be THAT much of a quality drop.Facilities:The pool is huge and I rarely saw more than one person in it. The gym is adequate, having more treadmills, (which always seem the most popular), than normal hotels. They even have this odd side to side machine which I've never seen before....and my groin will never be the same again. The concierge desk can arrange tours, tickets, cars direct. The spa is nice but it's China, so expect to be asked for &quot;extra service&quot;. A polite &quot;no thank you&quot; will do. Complaining is pointless, it's like complaining that they serve rice.....it's China, it's normal.Food:The breakfasts were great. Such a huge selection of western, chinese, japanese, etc. foods. It would be really picky/hard to make a complaint about the breakfasts, other than it does get a little busy/noisy at times. Tried the steak restaurant which was good but we found there wasn't a great selection on the menu. The chinese restaurant was great, especially the private non-smoking room, which was so quiet and nice for dinner. I wasn't brave enough to try the donkey meat though. Had room service one night and most of it was good, except for the liver pate which was probably the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. It had been frozen and wasn't completed thawed.....don't freeze pate at home kids.....Overall:The Eton hotel is one of those rare places that is truly well managed. There is nothing in particular that jumps out and says, &quot;this is what we're really good at&quot; or gives you that &quot;wow factor&quot;, but at the same time, at the end of your visit you'll notice everything was above average for your entire stay and the Eton will only have added to the pleasure of your trip. However; the one thing that the management can't change is the location, which isn't a huge deal, but it's certainly down in the 20's if you're ranking hotels solely on location.If I were to return to Shanghai for another stay I would probably try a different hotel closer to the action, but that's no knock against the Eton as I'd certainly recommend it to people. "
the eton hotel ,"beautiful hotel beautiful, clean hotel, English is spoken and understood, concierge can book attractions for you, taxis are easy to get, walking distance from Jinmao Tower, location a little far from most attractions but taxi/metro are cheap enough "
the eton hotel ,"Nice hotel poor location The Eton is a nice property however it's on the wrong side of the river. If you're in Shanghai on business, I would definitely recommend staying here, but if you're traveling for pleasure-as we were- I would suggest staying where all the action is.It took at least 30 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go since there's nothing really around the hotel.The rooms are nice and one could get lost in the vast bathrooms. The concierge was very helpful. We had a list of clubs we wanted to see (all in one night) and he set us up with their addresses, set up a car service for us, and we were off and running for the evening.Other than the concierge, the rest of the hotel seemed very impersonal. I can't exactly articulate it... the hotel just felt empty.Like I said, for business (or any other reason you might have to stay on this side of town) the Eton is great.But with the Four Season and Ritz-Carlton (and soon the Peninsula) on the other side of the river, there are better choices. "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel superb service location not best for tourism Very nice room and very good service. The hotel is located in Pudong business district, so not great a district as a tourist, but it is also next to a subway station, so it is easy to go wherever you want.The room is very comfortable, very nice design, the swimming pool is huge and the gym is well equipped. Overall an excellent hotel and a good value. "
the eton hotel ,Great Value You get a perfectly clean room with everything you need. It is certainly not a 5 star hotel in the European sense. It also seems a little strange. But Shanghai just is like that. I can reccommend this house if you are looking for a good value hotel. Friendly staff. 
the eton hotel ,"Visible signs of wear We stayed 6 nights, from May 12 to 18. Over all, this is a pretty nice hotel, from the main entrance, lobby all the way to inside the room and bathroom. The highest floor is 40, although my partner and I could only get to stay on the 28th floor, room 2806, the view was still gorgeous. Yes, we could see the Bund too. Across the hotel was the Metro station – problem was, crossing the busy streets of Shanghai was no easy task. It is bordering on dangerous – stop lights or not!All the staff we came in contact with – the bell boys, front desk and housekeeping staff – all friendly and very professional, and most spoke English. Certain parts of the room and the bathroom, there were visible signs of wear &amp; tear, and the ventilation in the bathroom was very, very poor – even after they “cleaned” it. Air conditioner works well but also needed a cleaning due to the super dirty air in Shanghai, like most of China.If you give Hong Kong or Singapore a 10 out of 10 for shopping, food and transportation, Shanghai would get a 4. As a guide, to me, Bangkok gets a 6 or 7 out of 10 and Kuala Lumpur (KL) in Malaysia gets a 3 or 2. Largely because the taxi drivers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore (the majority of them anyway) do not rip off their passengers, on the other hand, if you don’t get rip off by taxi drivers in Malaysia, consider yourself VERY, VERY lucky!Bottom line: This hotel beats all the hotels I have stayed in my 20+ years of travel, for instance, The Eaton Shanghai stayed at the #1 spot here for months and months, whereas, the Los Angeles Marriot’s rank has slid down 10 or more since I booked it in March this year!

the eton hotel ,"Good Value Hotel Stayed for 2 nights on the executive floor of the Eton having spent 1st night in the Shangria la hotel Shanghai.Liked:1. Great room. Modern and clean if not a little small bedroom.2. 2 nights here on exec floor with free breakfast and cocktails and drinks in evening is same price as 1 night at Shangri la.3. Nice gym and although i didnt use it, think theyve upgraded the Spa ( see other reviews re ladies of the night). 4. Good choice of food for breakfast although not in same class as Shangri la regarding food quality.5. 2pm checkoutDidnt like:1.

the eton hotel ,"another souless hotel in china We stayed in nov 07 after booking with expedia and getting a great price, we were looking forward to our stay here after all the great review's on trip advisor but were very much let down.after so much travel last year i think my immune system isnt great and my sister who i travel with and myself seem to get everything going and i was i'll the whole time we were there after getting food poisening in the club lounge.We always book the club and this is the most disapointing club iv ever been in, the seats are uncomfortable and you no this is so u won't stay to long, they follow you around constantly but when u ask them to get whatever you wanted you wait a lifetime on them bringing it. i noticed it was different if u were a man in this hotel.Also be very careful letting ur husband go for a massage here as they are offered extra's and hate to take no for an answer. We met 2 different sets of couples that this had happened to, 1 set was a gay couple and both of them had been offered extra's. both sets had complained but had not been given an explanation by the time they had left. I think it says a lot that u cant get room service after 11 but u can have a massage untill 2 in the morning. I really feel this hotel is a lovely hotel and a great price but i would worry about my partner being here alone and as in the case of both couples we met, id worry if i was with them!!If staying here again ( and my sister would throw a fit if i ever sugested it ) i would recomend not booking the club as its not worth the extra money and this is the 1st time iv ever recomended not booking a club room, the room's are very small so id recomend booking a larger room as these dont have club facilities, strangly enough. Also the rooms all seem to have the most awful views, even if its a river view, its all very industrieal in the surrounding area's.This Hotel does have nice products in there bathrooms but there not replinished unless u ask and this was the same of the tea and coffee. Very few staff members spoke english and just smiled and laughed like idiot's if u asked any questions.When we were checking out on the club floor, u had to go to the ground floor 1st and change money as they only except yen but as i was i'll ,i asked if they would sort this out for me and gave them the amount of dollers we had worked out it would be plus $40 extra just incase when he came back it had taken the extra $40 and he said it was still short and when we worked out how much it was short it was 13 pence but he waited on that and as is usual in china u get no change.I would recomend booking the hotel car to take u to the airport its worth the money and a very comfortable drive but strangly if u book it to pick u up at the airport they want you to send them ur credit card details in an email, they dont have a secure site to pay for this service. normally u book it and its added to ur hotel bill. I would recomend not getting a porter at the airport as its such a short walk in from where ur car or taxi lets u off and the porter leaves u at the door and asks for 150 yen for the 20 or 30 yards he pushed ur trolley.All in all this is a good value hotel and its also a nice hotel but the rooms r very small and as i was i'll we used room service a lot and it was consistantly bad and always cold but the seafood buffet was very good and worth every penny paid.The biggest thing letting this hotel down is the lack of service and it would benifit from the managment team staying somewhere else and using it as a learning process, I'd be pretty sure id never stay here again unless the service was greatly improved and the service in the spa was reined in. "
the eton hotel ,"Great Hotel stayed here 10th Jan for 4nights, after reading reviews, had high hopes and was not disappointed.The rooms were great, we were allocated a room on 37th floor which was very quiet. Corridors, hallway carpets and lifts always looked spotless. Room was excellent, nice big bathroom which had a lcd in it. Bedroom had really comfy beds, wall to ceiling windows, modern fixtures and fitting. Good selection of english tv channels on large lcd tv. Some websites suggest the location is not great, however, i would disagree, there is a subway station across the road from the hotel, and on demand taxis from hotel entrance (excluding 7pm-10pm from experience, whole of shanghai population seem to be queuing for taxis, it was normal practice to be waiting 30-60mins at ALL good hotels) a Costa Coffee literally next door as well as fresh juice bar 4doors away.We used the pool, which i must say was fantastic, 25metre pool located on 4th floor, as glass was tinted one way, you could see the shanghai life outside from the pool area, nice clean and warm changing area. Jacuzzi was not different temperature to pool which was a shame, but this was due to it being linked to main pool so advantage was pool was warm. Gym was also in excellent condition with 2 staff members there all the time and plenty of machines. As hotel was excellent, didn't really have any dealing with front desk except checking in/out where they were efficient. Concierge could of been better, 1guy was very good, however the rest didn't really speak good English and just said yes to our questions. As i am a fairly savvy traveler, i don't really rely on these guys though.Had a snack in lobby lounge which was ok, but a bit expensive for what it was, but i guess you are staying in a 5star hotel. They do offer a seafood buffet which looked good value for what is was, however we didn't try it.If you are a food lover which i am, my biggest tip is try the Shangri-la buffet in the evening, it is simply amazing, the quality of food cannot be surpassed, dim-sum, Italian, every style of Chinese, Thai, Malay, Indian, Western, you name it, they have it, and it all tastes fantastic! you must go there hungry though as its around 300 RMBoverall, i would most definitely stay here again, yes its not on the waterfront for the breath-taking view, but taxis are plentiful and the service is top notch! A great base for Shanghai "
the eton hotel ,"Best Value in Shanghai I booked this hotel based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed.Great rooms, great staff, close to metro.Best thing about the hotel was the towels. These were the largest towels I have ever seen.I booked on expedia.com for $136 "
the eton hotel ,"Excellent hotel Me and my friends stayed there for 9 nights and I can say we are absolutely satisfied with the service we got there. Views for the city are one of the best in entire Shanghai, you can see everything, so if you are the big fan of city's views this hotel is for you. Bellboys are always willing to help and the service is nice. breakfasts are more expensive than in other places but they worth it. Like everybody else who ever stayed in the Eton hotel I can say that it looks very modern and well equipped. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in China. So, I can recommend it to everybody, does not matter if you travel for fun or business. (some areas around it dont look very safety but it's absolutely safety to walk even in them during the late's night time...many restaurants are located there and a lot of massage saloons which offer more than massage service only :) this one for those who like to have &quot;hot&quot; travels :0) So, most of people find what they want staying in this hotel and location is not than bad also. Taxis are extremely cheap and it takes about 15 minutes to get to any most important and interesting places in Shanghai to see. There are only 2 sightseeings which takes us more than 20 minutes to get to. it is Jin Jiang Amusement park and Safari Wild Animals park. All the rest is &quot;just around&quot; the corner. If I ever get back to Shanghai I will stay there once again. No doubts!!!! "
the eton hotel ,"Exceed all expectations! I booked this hotel for my 2 nights stay during my recent trip to Shanghai (in fact I just came back home today) after reading all the positive feedback on tripadvisor. I am not a fussy visitor but having been to quite a few hotels, I have high standard for what I would think nice, and it is normally even harder to please my mother. However, dispite having been reading all those positive reviews, this hotel has totally exceeded all our expectations still - the room is new, clean, and stylishly designed. They use good quality furniture, hardware, matress, pillow, toothbrush, bathrobe etc etc. The hotel locates in perfectly in a decent busniss district - just opposite the metro station and next to bus stops. It's no more than 20 - 30 minutes in a taxi to all the attractions (which would be around 20 - 30RMB) if you don't feel like taking the metro. The only few things I would recommand the hotel to improve is that: more smiles on the faces (they are polite and nice but may not be accustomed to smiling a lot) and speakers in the bathroom area (doesn't bother me without tho). I would most defintely stay in this hotel again should I visit the city in the future. "
the eton hotel ,"One of the Best! I decided to stay at the Eton Hotel for 3 days during my 10 day stay in China based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed! The room was spacious, very clean and comes equipped with everything you can imagine and more! The views of the city were stunning! Located right across the street from the Pudong Ave metro station and within easy access to the major sights. We either walked or took the subway majority of the time in Shanghai. The only time we took a taxi was to the airport and that was because we had too much luggage and didn't want to drag them on the subway. However, there could've been some improvements. I booked my room through Expedia.ca and arrived around 8pm. We had to wait another 1 hour until we could check in because we were told that the room was not ready. However, we were so hungry so we just went out to eat dinner and came back to check in so it was not too bad. As well, I wish the price could've included internet service. I find the daily rate to be quite pricey at around 120 RMB per day. Instead, we used the one at the coffee shop next door or the internet cafe located a couple of blocks away.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Shanghai. Two thumbs up! "
the eton hotel ,"Great hotel location not the best spa is basically a massage parlour Chose the hotel because of its rating here and have to say that for the price it is a terrific deal. We upgraded to the Exec floor and were happy with the room although it was a bit smaller than expected for an Asian hotel room. It was clean, the bathroom was excellent - round bath, large separate shower room. Enjoyed the Exec lounge, quietbreakfast atmosphere, nice free evening drinks after hard day sightseeing and shopping, all dy coffee, tea, soft drinks, cakes etc.Location is a bit remote for the Bund side of the city but taxis are VERY cheap so you just hop in and they take you where you want to go.Traffic is a lot quieter here than in any other Asian metropolis I've visited so you don't spend most of your time in jams. Gym is well appointed for a hotel and is well maintained and kept clean and tidy.The only drawback is the Spa which is one reason to chose a hotel for us. This one is outsourced and so fails to meet the quality and standards of teh hotel itself. It is best summed up as a high class massage parlour, the masseurs seemed more interested in other &quot;massages&quot; than the one you asked for, aw a man anyway. The spa has no ambience - no music, no mood lighting, no quiet areas - its brightly lit everywhere, functional and a far cry from other spa's offered by such quality hotels. The Eton general mgr contacted me after my feedback to apologise and inform me that the spa has been warned, so maybe it will improve. "
the eton hotel ,"Pleasantly Surprised I was skeptical of home grown hotels and usually stay in US chains when in China, but the Eton has given me an epiphany. Very friendly and attentive staff, great rooms with beautiful bathrooms and all very clean. They also had a great breakfast spread that would easily rival a Conrad or JW anywhere. I will not be staying in any other hotels in Shanghai now that I have been there. "
the eton hotel ,Excellent hotel Very good hotel at a reasonable price. No wonder its 1st on Trip Advisor. 
the eton hotel ,"Excellent This is a flash hotel at a reasonable price. Located opposite Pudong avenue metro station, the hotel was extremely comfortable, clean and looked very expensive. Marble bathroom, nice carpet &amp; excellent beds. We stayed on the 28th floor, view of Shanghai was superb.Hotel is very easy to get to, the staff are helpful and speak english. Not too far from most attractions - either by taxi or pay max 3 to 4 RMB on the metro.Booked via expedia, breakfast was not included, catch a metro to Bunt and have breakfast there. "
the eton hotel ,"Pleasantly surprised We picked this hotel for our first night in China because we were looking for comfortable beds to get over our jet lag. We were shocked to find that the &quot;nice&quot; hotel we booked was instead a luxury hotel. The beds were soft and comfy. The bathroom was super nice with a separate shower/bath and the bathtub had its very own flatscreen. Beware that the bathroom is separated from the rest of the room by glass walls (with shades), but probably not for the shy or timid. The members of the staff were very helpful and didn't bat an eye when we rolled into the lobby with our giant backpacks. It was always easy to get a cab outside the front door, but the location was a bit off the beaten path. There is a metro stop right across the street, however. This was the highlight of our China hotels and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
the eton hotel ,"Simply the Best Spent four nights in a premier room (like a suite) 27th Floor Grand Prix Period. Could not fault this Hotel absolutely first rate in everyway and so spotlessly clean. The Premier room was well worth the little extra cost, fantastic bathroom, windows on three sides of the room for fantastic views of Shanghai. Buffet Breakfast was excellent and beautifully presented. Taxis at the ready once you step outside the Hotel door, doorman will tell driver where you wish to go but be sure to have a Hotel Business card for your return journey as the taxi drivers do not speak english. The location of the Hotel was not a problem as Cabs are so cheap and plentiful.Just a couple of tips. Be extra cautious crossing the road (especially if you are from Australia/NZ as they drive on the other side of the road. Do have a foot massage only 50RMB for a full hour, a friend recommended us to a place opposite the Novotel Hotel just a short walk from the Eton Hotel. The staff where so friendly even though they had limited English. We ended up calling in every eveningafter a hectic day at the track. Anyone thinking of going to the Grand Prix next year just email me as I have plenty of information retransport etc. "
the eton hotel ,"Excellent Service and Amenities Stayed on an Executive floor at the Eton for three days in Ocober '07 and look forward to going back. The service at the hotel was excellent, the fitness facility was state of the art and the location, while not prime for sightseeing, made for an easy taxi ride into the heart of Shanghai. I recommend paying the small difference and staying on an Executive floor. The included breakfast, day time refreshments and evening wine/beer/cocktails more than make up for the difference in price. Overall, in terms of value, the Eton is hard to beat. "
the eton hotel ,"Amazing I have to stay this is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Everything in this hotel is well thought out. It’s spacious, modern, clean, and tidy; the staff are attentive and friendly.Our twin room was on the 27th floor of the hotel. We’d paid a little bit extra for the view – and what a great view we had of the Pudong Business District with the Jin Mao Tower clearly visible. We could see the top of Pearl Tower in the distance but the majority of the building was masked by some other buildings. Our room had two queen sized beds, flat screen TV, desk, two chairs, coffee table and ample storage space. The bathroom was amazing (see pictures) and also had a flat screen TV. The room had bathrobes, slippers and great selection of toiletries.The swimming pool was amazing too, again everything had been well thought out.Getting around Shanghai was quite easy. This hotel has an underground station next to it, although taxis are extremely cheap and are plentiful outside the hotel. BEWARE, the driving in China takes a little bit of getting used to. The Pearl Tower is within walking distance from the hotel, from here you can take the tourist tunnel to the Bund. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night at the ‘Singaporean BBQ’. The food was tasty, fresh and very well presented. On our last night we enjoyed cocktails in the Lobby Lounge which featured a pianist. On both occasions we were well looked after and the prices were very reasonable. This hotel is brand new and it clearly shows, it’s very modern and suited our tastes, however, if you prefer something a little chintzier, it might not be your cup of tea.For a great meal head over to the Grand Hyatt hotel atop the Jin Mao tower, here you can enjoy a buffet with great views over the city. It was an excellent meal with a wide variety of both Chinese and western food at a very reasonable price. "
the eton hotel ,"Oasis in Shanghai Highly recommend the Executive Rooms with breakfast, evening drinks and canapes. Shanghai is a busy, brilliant, chaotic city and the Eton Hotel was a convenient, relaxing base for our holiday. Clean, well designed, Metro subway right across the street, great staff, good food and refreshing swimming pool. The Executive room has a fantastic view across the city, and looks amazing daytime and dazzling at night – with the many architectural wonders lit up, including the Oriental Pearl Tower. The Eton is close to town, yet a little further way from the maddening crowds of central Shanghai. "
the eton hotel ,"Stunning design My wife and I stayed in this hotel during the Special Olympics. We had a wonderful experience at the hotel, staff are courteous with excellent English skills and very helpful for advice on getting around the city and what to see.The building itself does what good design is supposed to do...lift your spirits. "
the eton hotel ,"Excellent service - value for money We are a family of four staying in Eton Hotel for 3 nights in Sep. We chose to stay in Executive floor. With that extra bit of money, it is absolutely worth it. Breakfast is well prepared and adequate and drinks are available all day in the executive lounge.Staff are all polite and helpful. Rooms are spacious with separate shower and bath area.Although it is not in the central shopping area , taxi is very cheap and you can also try the MTR system. There is a MTR station right in front of the hotel. Overall , we are very happy about the hotel and it is value for money. "
the eton hotel ,"A top class hotel Out of all the different hotels in Shanghai, I must say the Eton has the most helpful, friendly, courteous, professional and welcoming staff of the lot. Nothing is a problem no matter what time of day or night - there is always a friendly smile. I just returned from an extended stay in Shanghai. We chose the Eton Hotel based on online searches and the clincher was the high rating on Tripadvisor. We were NOT disappointed!A top class hotel with an excellent location. The hotel is located in the Pudong district of Shanghai - a vital location if you are in Shanghai on business. One of the best features is the metro station which is located right outside the hotel – this makes all of Shanghai easily accessible. We pulled up in the taxi and the doorman opened our door immediately and welcomed us warmly and took care of the luggage. We walked into the foyer and right away felt impressed - it looked great! The rooms are exactly as they appear on the website as are the common areas of the hotel. Unlike other hotels, their website is not edited to look better than the real thing. All of the materials in the room are of superior quality - from the high end bed linens and funky furniture to the eye pleasing wall artwork and the beautiful marble bathroom. There was a 32” in LCD in the bed room and a 17” LCD in the bathroom, both with international news and movie channels.Our room was very comfortable. The small features such as the turn down service and bottled water were a nice touch. The hotel also provides L'OCCITANE toiletries - shower gel, lotion, shampoo &amp; conditioner and they replenish them every day!The breakfasts were excellent. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family and would definitely return. "
the eton hotel ,"The Eton - A Mixed Bag My wife and I have just returned from 3 nights at The Eton Shanghai. All in all the hotel is great value for money, but there are a few factors you should be aware of before booking.The hotel itself is very new and well appointed. I'd recommend upgrading to the &quot;executive floors&quot; which are probably the best value for money rooms I've stayed in, and certainly on par with the best &quot;modern&quot; sytle 5 star hotels that I've stayed in.There are only two downsides to The Eton. The first is the location. It is on the outer of the Pudong section. If you want to be in the thick of Shanghai, then stay on The Bund side of town. A trip across town by taxi to The Bund area, while very cheap (4-5 AUD) takes 25-30 mintues. If the nightlife of The Bund is what you are after, then The Eton isn't the best hotel choice. If you don't mind the travel, The Eton is fine (there is a metro station 20 metres out of the front door).Secondly, the service levels are fairly poor, and explain why The Eton is 4 star, not 5. The staff can't be faulted for effort, but generally their knoweldge of English is relatively poor for such a quality hotel. We experienced service challenges of one kind or the other with the front desk, room service, executive lounge, spa and front desk. The staff's politeness and helpfulness go a long way to rectifying these challenges, but overall the service is of a 3 star level at best (in fact it was signficantly worse that the 3 star hotel we stayed in while in Beijing).If you pack your patience, and don't mind a bit of extra travel, I'd recommend The Eton as a clean, modern and attractive hotel.

the longemont shanghai ,"They were on it. I just stayed two days at the Longemont and I had a very good experience. I booked the hotel online via expedia I believe and left a note requesting a room with a view at a high floor number. Looks like they read it since I got my room on the 46th of about 56 floors. Great view which was part of my plan to get a good understanding of the extent of the city. I only saw a slice of it, but I now know its ginormous for real.Great attentive service and clean rooms. Not very tacky, and things seemed to had been properly installed. I never figured out how to change the AC form 21C but i never bothered to call the reception. Very quick turnaround on the service. I called down and asked for a map. They answer right away and I had a map delivered within a minute or 2. I also stayed long in the room (3pm) one day and forgot to tell them I went out in case they could clean the room. But they figured that out and I returned to a fresh room! Stuff like that makes me impressed.I slept through the breakfast buffet (not included in my price for some reason) both days and ended up ordering from the ala carte menu in the all-day-restaurant. I picked the Japanese breakfast which was uninspiring and pricey at 138 RMB or so with service fee. IT was the only meal I had at the hotel so I couldnt tell if the food was generally boring. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Phenomenal Hotel This place was our final stay during our tour package. Pretty amazing hotel, I must say. It easily rivaled some of the best hotels I've ever stayed in in the US. Beautiful rooms, very luxurious, amazing lobby. The breakfast was very good, not outstanding, but it was very good. I was expecting more since the hotel itself is so awesome, but I have no complaints about the breakfast. The chef of the breakfast is a European guy, so the Euro stuff is good, but the Asian stuff is not so good. Otherwise, it was a great hotel, no question. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Originally The Regent but still very nice There has been an ownership change &amp; the Regent name has been removed, but the hotel is still 5 star quality. The location may be a problem for some, but with taxi's so cheap in Shanghai, it's only $3-4 USD to get to The Bund or Pudong. Large rooms, oversized bathrooms with separate tub &amp; shower, &amp; some rooms have bathroom walls that slide open to the rest of the room. The facility has the usual Regent high quality touches &amp; attention to design detail. Try to get a corner Studio with room numbers that end with 02 or 13, &amp; you'll be impressed by the larger spaces. Spectacular views on a clear day, since the hotel occupies the top floors of a 50+ story office building. Fantastic roof top infinity pool &amp; one of the most impressive gyms I've seen at any hotel. Great restaurants, wonderful soft beds compared to most in China, &amp; top notch service. Priced as you would expect for 5 star quality. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Good modern hotel........ Stayed for 2 nights with my husband after business trip in Zhejiang province. Hotel reception very large, clean and modern, staff efficient and friendly. Our double room was on 26 floor and at first appearance looked very modern and tidy. However, upon closer inspection some of the furniture and fittings were dented/scratched and the computer desk had dried in food stains. Carpets needed a good wash as they looked grubby. Double bed was very comfortable though. Wireless internet free in your room and we had a large plasma TV too.There was lots to choose from the buffet breakfast, from Chinese congee to pastries, cereals, baked beans, bacon, sausages ands fresh fruit to name a few. We ate out in the evening around Shanghai city as it was a lot cheaper than the hotel's restaurants.This hotel is a bit out the way from the centre of Shanghai and is not near any public train system therefore we got around by taxi which we picked up outside the hotel. Taxis are cheap to get around Shanghai. "
the longemont shanghai ,"No hot water Overall excellent rooms, but downgraded to 2 stars as no hot water in the early morningPlace felt clinical and unfriendlyVery comfortable bedsLocation - not in tourist area but you are only 5-10 mins away by taxi.... not really much to see in Shanghai (certainly NOT a tourist destination)Shanghai is very polluted and overcast all the time - would not recommend it to anyoneI gave this a 2 star as there was no hot water for the shower despite fiddling with the setting for over 5 minutesOn check out the staff didnt ask what I thought of my stay, how was the room, etc so I wasnt able to comment and with indifferent staff I didnt see the point in feeding back the fact that my stay was spoilt by having to have a cold showerI wouldnt stay again "
the longemont shanghai ,"Excellent hotel! We stayed here for four nights after spending three nights in Peninsula Beijing...It's a former Regent hotel and we payed it about 100 USD per night/room. We had a rom on 20-something floor and we were amazed with it. The view was perfect, windows floor to ceiling, big bath-tub, walk-in shower with lights inside and you really feel perfect. You've got everything you need to have in 5 star hotel. Location is on the way from smaller airport to the city center and you need 20 minutes to the Bund, depends on traffic. This was one of the best hotels I ever stayed in, for me much better than Peninsula in Beijing... "
the longemont shanghai ,"Awesome Hotel Stayed here for 9 nights at the Corner Suite on the 51st Floor, The view from the hotel is simply amazing and one can see the Shanghai Skyline from the full glass walls of the bathroom !!! Awestruck is what you feel from there. Most hotel would not have rooms of the size of the bathrooms here with Aigner Amenities and rain shower and jaccuzzi you feel like a king in a castle. The rooms are contemporary decor with plush furnishingsThe Staff of the hotel is very warm and friendly and the ever smiling and helpful concierge would never let you feel out of place. While on the move from the hotel the concierge would always make sure that the Taxi Driver takes you to the right place and the name of the place are always handed over to the guest scribbled in mandarin with a return card that you could hand over to the cab driver which says &quot;My Residence in Shanghai&quot; with the address of the hotel printed in Mandarin and English.The service at the hotel is simply superb with excellent food, the lobby bar comes alive in the night with live piano and signing performance by a pop duo. Amici the Italian Dining at the hotel offers excellent food and is very highly rated in Shanghai. Even the breakfast at the breakfast lounge is a very vast buffet spread with huge choices between western and hot asian breakfast.The Hotel is situated in the city centre but is slightly away from tourist spots like The Bund or the Nanjing Road but that is hardly of much consequence, its no more than a 20 minute cab ride. One can easily accept this little fact as Shanghai city centre itself is quite huge. For those who wish to avoid the shanghai traffic its a 500M walk to the nearest MRT or Metro from this place which connects you to the Nanjing Lu "
the longemont shanghai ,"Excellent hotel We stayed at the Longemont in April 2009 and had a truly excellent stay.We were fortunate enough to stay in a suite on the corner of floor 43 where the views are absolutely stunning. The room was immaculately clean and had 2 42&quot; flat screen TV's with just about every other convenience you could wish for. The bathroom was absolutely enormous with a huge cylindrical glass shower that looked out over the view.Breakfast was served in the very spacious and extremely comfortable club lounge and had freshly baked European style bread, and a variety of western and Asian hot and cold foods - significantly better than many other club lounges I've visited.Service was impeccable - at one stage the hotel a/c failed and we complained on our way out. When we returned 4 hours later they had left a note in the room apologising and giving us the results of the temperature tests they had conducted twice whilst we were out.The reception areas is very pleasant with a great bar and lovely coffee shop where they bake their own bread.We would definitely recommend the Longemont. "
the longemont shanghai ,"For modern tech savvy travellers Overall fantastic...where do I start? Stayed in a suite on the club floor....it had everything. Lots of plugs of various types (no need for adapters) in all the places you'd expect them to be. Nice LCD TV, iPOD docking station, hi-speed internet, lights switches everywhere so you don't even need to get out of the bed just in case you forgot to turn a light off. Even have individual lighting for reading whilst in bed.Overall the interior design was planned out very well, its modern, spacious, the beds are amazing and so are the pillows (normally what I tend to complain a lot about), towels are huge too. They've even thought about things such as a magazine rack next to the toilet for people who enjoy having a read whilst...hmm...The only down side regarding the room would be the water pressure from the shower which I thought could be better.Location? about 10-15mins away from Nanjing, not much around the hotel except for a bunch of massage places :) So if you're looking at taking a stroll out of the hotel and doing some shopping stay at the Hilton.One of the best overall experiences at a hotel I've been at in a while. I choose hotels not based on the name, but more on the facilities, room design and overall review from other travellers.You should check out the Wynn in Macau which is also spectacular or for those on a slightly tighter budget, Star World Hotel, located opposite which is very, very similar to the Longemont. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Thank You for our great stay at The Longemont! My husband and I have just returned from 7 nights at the Longemont Shanghai and we enjoyed our stay there immensely. I had booked the hotel based on previous reviews on Tripadvisor and I was a little worried as there weren't any reviews for 2009. However, I got a great deal which included buffet breakfasts for two, which I just couldn't pass up. In addition, I also was a bit weary about comments about the Longemont's location.... The first day we arrived at the hotel, via a taxi from Pudong Airport, it was 9:00 a.m. and check-in wasn't supposed to be until 2:00 p.m., so I was expecting them to turn us away and simply store our luggage. But no, they asked no questions and happily gave us the key to our room on the 40th floor. We were most impressed and extremely pleased as well!! The staff were all very attentive and pleasant everyday. The buffet breakfast was amazing, both Asian and Western food catered for. The room was lovely and spacious. The Metro only 10 minutes walk from the hotel, which was great because the taxis, although cheap, wasted a lot of time in traffic, which drove me nuts. I enjoyed the thrill and excitement of taking the Metro (Jiangsu Rd. Station (Line 2)), to anywhere we wanted to go. It was very simple and inexpensive (3 or 4 rmb each/each way). We also felt comfortable to walk at night and eat outside the hotel. We had a fabulous meal at the famous Restaurant 1221 our last night. It is just across the road, about a 5 minutes walk. We also enjoyed a fabulous Seafood buffet on Friday night at the hotel, which was amazing and very well priced. The seafood, the vege dishes, etc., and even the desserts were to die for. I cannot remember the last time I ate so much, but we ate slowly and paced ourselves so as to savour every bite. The Longemont is a great hotel, and I highly recommend it. I am a very picky person and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was certainly impressed by what I found at the Longemont. I am sure you will be too! The Longemont for me was my home away from home and I felt extremely comfortable there. There was not a need that they couldn't cater for. Congratulations to the Longemont Shanghai for a job well done!!! We will most definitely be back again! Many Thanks! "
the longemont shanghai ,"Enjoyed it Very Much I was visiting my son who is studying in Shanghai and stayed for 2 nights . My room on 45th floor had an excellent view. The room is the best I've been in Shanghai with huge bathroom and and a large 40&quot; flat TV. The internet is included which was a nice surprise. I've stayed at several others 5 stars hotels in Shnaghai but this one is the best of all. Check in was a breeze, the concierge was very helpfull, the buffets one of the best in China (I tried them all: breakfast, lunch and dinner) with a great selection of western food. A little away from the main tourist areas, but very easy to get taxis anyways. In all a wonderfull experience. I recommend it to both business and leisure travelers. "
the longemont shanghai ,Longemont is # 1 I am a business travler. I have stayed at many of the top hotels in Shanghai over the past 15 years. None of them compare to the Longemont (formerly the Regent) in terms of value.It is a 5 star hotel for the price of a 4 star with free internet and many other perks. This October was my 5th stay at the hotel....the first 3 were while the it was still managed by the Regent. I was a bit apprehensive with the change of management but it has had no negative affect on quality or service. I would recomend this hotel to everyone and anyone looking for a great deal. 
the longemont shanghai ,"Great Place to Stay Period Of Stay:21-July-2008 to 27-July-2008Booking:We booked the hotel online through Agoda, which was a really good price and didn’t have any problems with it.Check-In:No problems with check-in, nice and quick. They also offered us an upgrade to the next type of room, which we declined.Room:3615 The room was really nice and well designed. The bathroom was nice and big, not like some hotels which give you a matchbox. The view wasn’t that great but still nice in the night with the lights from the other buildings.The only two annoying things about the room were the lights, when you would turn the light on/off in the bathroom and the other lights in the room were off, it would turn the lights on above the bed, which was very annoying for the other person in bed. The other annoying thing was the fridge, for the first 3 days it would never get cold, it finally got really cold on the last 3 days of the stay.Hotel Facilities: - Internet Access – this was free and quite good, although it seemed a lot of the sites wouldn’t work, but still a usable service - Pool/Gym – Only went down and viewed these, they both looked really nice. - Restaurants – Had breakfast included with the room, this was at O2on2, the food was good, but it did get boring after the 4th morning as it was the same each morning; we went to have dinner at the Chinese restaurant our last night there, we sat down and went to order, but most of the items on the menu weren’t available (no chicken or beef), so we went back to the O2on2 for dinner that night.Location:The location most likely isn’t the best in Shanghai and we were worried about that when we first got there. But after a couple of days and getting some idea of where we were it wasn’t a bad location at all. There was a subway about a 5-10 minute walk away, which then made getting around easy. Also cause the taxi’s are so cheap we used them when we couldn’t be bothered walking to the subway.There are a fair amount of places to eat around the hotel and mini-marts everywhere too.Check-Out:No problems at all, nice and quick.Overall:We would be happy to stay here again as it was a very nice place to stay, even on the night of my birthday the hotel put a birthday cake in our room which was really nice of them.The hotel had changed names from “The Regent Shanghai” to “The Longement Shanghai” which was why the Regent signs had been taken down. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Decent Hotel Unlike the other reviews on Trip Advisor, I found the hotel to be decent. I stayed at this property in March 2008. My room at the 22nd floor offered good view of the city. The room was basic, but decent enough for a good night sleep after days hard work. The bathroom had a separate shower capsule (which was a little bit cramped up) and a bath tub. The hotel's lobby is worth a word. It’s quite spacious and attractive. Besides breakfast (which used to be good, with a choice of Chinese and international cuisines), I never had an opportunity to eat food in the hotel. Overall a good place to stay if you are in Shanghai for work, specially if you are visiting some office in the Yan An Road. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Going downhill offhand service awful location I was booked into another hotel but moved to the Regent on the basis of various things i read online especially the glowing comments about the pool. A big mistake as the pool was closed for 3 weeks when i was there. Don't get me wrong this is not terrible hotel and to the undiscerning traveller it may even be perceived to be good. But I have an irritating eye for detail and I am quite spoiled so I always notice the bad things quickly. Firstly, here are the good things so it doesn't get too one-sided....the views from most of the rooms, probably all, are amazing, esp from the bathrooms.....the rooms are quite modern and big and the beds are big....and in general it is a 4/ 41/2 satar hotel. But not quite 5 and certainly not 5+. Why not? Firstly, the staff are pretty offhand and take no real interest in you either on checkin or checkout or at any other time. They have a functional approach rather than a hospitable one. Secondly, the hotel was not shiny and clean and there was grime in some areas, cracked paintwork, worn carpets etc. Even the sign outside the hotel was broken thus making it hard to find. Thirdly, many things were being renovated during my stay including the pool which i was not told about when i booked. no compensation or apologies made regarding the pool just a cold letter (4 in fact) in my room on arrival informing me that many things were being renovated. Finally and most importantly, the location is awful. It is far far from the centre of things, maybe an hour at worst but normally at least half an hour therefore meaning you spend most of your day on the motorwy going backwards and forwards. I found this so irritating i checked out early even though i had pre-paid and went instead to the JW Mariott which is in a totally and utterly different class and much better location. One final note, the hotel changed hands in July 2008, and is now dual-named altho not sure how long this will last. It is no longer a Regent anyway. The new name is the Ridgemount or Longmount or something having to do with mount. But it is not a Regent any more. Maybe they, like me, decided it wasn't up to scratch and wanted to get rid of it. Not recommended. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Only a 4star Regent We selected the Regent because of its name and previous experiences in Regent Hotels. This is definitely not the 5star Regents we were used to. They have taken over from another 4star chain and that is what is today. The hotel itself is already pretty used if you just take a closer look. Nothing of the elegance and cleanliness of a typical Regent Hotel. The coffee shop has some tables along the windows with glass table tops. Unfortunately the tops had moved slightly off their normal position and we looked right at the breadcrumbs and other dirt between the edge of the table and the glass top. Nobody dared to clean that and to shift the tops back into their position. The menus were heavily used without many choices, the buffet quite poor. The chinese &quot;open&quot; restaurant had the smallest menue I have ever seen in a chinese restaurant. The post cards which we handed to the Bell captain (and paid for the stamps) have not arrived anywhere after 3 weeks. As a Regent a disappointment and I shall have a closer look at their buildings in the future because the picture I saw is misleading. Overall just average. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Amazing This, it has to be said is one of the best hotels that i've ever stayed in. The view of it when you first arrive is magnificant. The rooms were beyond luxurious and the lobby was beautiful. It has the most amazing pool. The staff were curtious and friendly and we felt very welcomed. The food was delicious. The hotel was just amazing and made the holiday one of the best that we've ever had. Definately recommend this to anyone. 5 Star. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Disappointed with The Regent We booked the 'romantic package' for our last night in China. This included welcome flower set up, sparkling wine, 15 minute massage and afternoon high tea.Unfortunately the staff did not seem aware that this package existed.Check in took a long time and we were met with a blank look when we explained the type of package we had booked. It took some persuading to convince the waiter that afternoon tea was included in our rate.The lady in the Spa did not seem happy about the fact one of us had a complimentary 15 minute massage. The sparkling wine eventually arrived late evening and the welcome flower set up was non-existent.The best part of our stay was the excellent massages we had at beauty salon a two minute walk from the hotel! "
the longemont shanghai ,"Loved the regent I had the pleasure of staying at the Regent Shanghai for a travel conference and was greeted with a suite perched high on the 30th floor. The hotel was fabulous and the service exceptional. The facilities for dining, relaxing and working out where first class and I would have no hesitation recommending this five star hotel to others. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Great hotel This is a great hotel, although so high!!!! I stayed on 41st floor, the highest room I have been in for a long time...Maybe next time I would choose a slightly lower floor, 20???Great rooms, love the bath being almost in the bedroom (shutters can be opened to achieve this or closed off if this is your preference).Nice bars (try the cigar bar which nobody seems to know about, really nice decor and intimate set-up for private conversations, nobody was smoking cigars when i was in there , thankfully).Amici Italian restaurant, great food and service.Regent has a great name and this hotel lives up to its reputation. I wopuld stay there again. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Exceeded expectations When it comes to hotels, I am hard to please and to be frank I wasn't expecting much when I booked the Regent. From previous trips to China, I knew that the country's strongest point wasn't its hospitality industry. Yet, I was positively impressed.First, the service was seamless. I would leave the room to go to breakfast and upon my return the room was made. I would go for a few hours, and the supply of water bottles was replenished. And so on. Interestingly, I never saw a housekeeping cart or anyone hanging around in the corridors. Things were just happening behind the scenes, out of sight. I like that.Service was effective and responsive. For example, I needed some urgent items and they did the shopping very quickly for me. As an aside, I gave the guy some money for the shopping, which turned out to be fake. So he had to pay for the stuff himself, and he was adamant that he didn't want any extra money. I did pay him again, of course, but I liked the genuine attempt to empathise.One small problem: I asked one of the staff for directions to a cafe where I could sit in the sun to enjoy a cuppa. He directed me fairly poorly to a Starbucks that I never found. Upon coming back from my useless search for the starbucks I found exactly the kind of cafe I was after literally a few meters away, opposite the hotel. I'm not sure what the guy was thinking! Really, they're not great with directions.I was impressed with the food, both Asian and Western. I ordered some room service and was truly blown away by the pizza! Well, I was starving at the time, but it was great pizza nonetheless...The location was good (short and cheap taxi rides to everywhere), the view from my room on the 51st floor was fabulous, and the breakfast buffet was one of the most varied and tastiest I have experienced.Internet in the room was free (so it should be!!), the TV was large and even had connectors to plug in laptops etc (a great and unusual touch!!), the choice of TV channels was good, the shower and bathroom were outstanding (though some items were made of plastic, but good plastic at least) and the staff was friendly.As I said, it really exceeded expectations and I have given it an &quot;excellent&quot; rating. A rarity for me! "
the longemont shanghai ,Opulent but not downtown A real five star hotel. 20 minutes by taxi to main shopping district. Amazing swimming pool and gym. We stayed on level 45 - seemed like the tallest building in town. They supplied a DVD player complimentary - flat screen TV in all rooms. Bathroom was first class except had sliding doors - not a big deal. Some noise carried through when adjoing room had TV loud. Multiple restaurants in hotel and they were good. Japanese restaurant nearby. Also near two corner stores - mini supermarkets like 7/11's. This hotel is 30 minutes from the domestic airport. The international airport (Pudong) is 60+ minutes drive - Sunday traffic. Was difficult to get taxi's when raining and as the hotel is not in the centre of town. Great for business meetings. For travel Shanghai was a dissapointment - Beijing was amazing. For shopping Shanghai has endless shopping centres will many famous brands. 
the longemont shanghai ,"Great Hotel Great Value This was my fourth stay at the Regent this year as it ticked all my boxes. Extremely comfortable rooms, spacious bathrooms, good gym and pool, slightly out of the centre so did not get caught up in the awful Shanghai traffic when going out on business. However to get to the centre for leisure, out of the rush hour, was only about 1GB pound and a few minutes in one of the abundant taxis. The all you can eat buffet in the large restaurant catered for almost any type of food; Chinese, pasta, salads, shellfish, western meats / vegetables and a wide selection of desserts all for around 12 GBP. Check in staff a bit grumpy, couldn't fathom the air-conditioning but they would be my only gripes. Definitely worth a stay. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Missed food in hotel lobby... Of course the hotel was good, it's the Regent!Great room with great view at the 43rd floor. Huge bathroom with all kinds of toiletries.But when we arrived at 5 pm and wanted to have a little snack before dining in the city, we were disappointed. No snack in the hotel lobby! We could join the high tea, but only the full package. For a snack we were sent to 1 of the restaurants in the hotel.So we took 2 starters at the Italian restaurant. Of course we were the only guests at that time! And the restaurant staff was obviously disappointed that we didn't take a main course as well, a pity. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Excellent Hotel I was looking for the best hotel for the price. I read the very mixed reviews on this website. After checking the hotel, Fodors guide etc. I decided to take a chance. It is a stunning hotel with spacious modern rooms. The &quot;plastic&quot; bathroom bowl was very practical and nothing else in the room was cheaply made. The beds are very comfortable. Every encounter with staff was friendly and helpful. The swimming pool is spectacular. Do get the breakfast included as the choice is abundant. This was a super hotel especially for the price. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Gee this is a REGENT? It wasn't &quot;get me out of here&quot; bad, but they can't seriously call this a 5 star hotel. Staff: some very nice and friendly, others curt, careless, at best disinterested, like the bar manager who worked her calculator for 5 minutes whilst we were waiting with the Evil Eye for her to notice us for a drinks menu. Rooms are okay but shouldn't they be more than that - small, such low lighting it's annoying, sloppy cleaning, inconsistent housekeeping (no shampoo for 2 days and a 35 minute wait to get some). And that nice-looking plasma - don't expect it to work well or at all for hours at a time.Food's great - breakfast and the Sunday brunch was fab. Good gym and pool.But The Regent has got to do something about the people who let them down really badly. But does anyone at The Regent Shanghai actually care? "
the longemont shanghai ,"Fantastic luxury property Overall, I loved the Regent. There were some complaints listed in profiles that were somewhat justified but it's all about expectations. It's a very new property on the western edge of the former French Concession. As such, it's technically central Shanghai but on the edge of it. That said, it's never more than a 15 minute taxi ride to anywhere in Puxi. Taxi drivers may not know it if you try to tell them and don't speak Chinese but the 'take me to' card from the hotel works very well. It's also very convenient for domestic flights from Hongqiao airport (and took under an hour to Pudong airport). The hotel is beautiful (though they should have chosen real porcelain washbasins but that's a small criticism). I stayed twice in August and September 2007. Both rooms were great and fairly large with fantastic views. The hotel has a beautiful infinity edge pool overlooking the city from a glass-enclosed aerie on the 26th floor. Service was always excellent and very professional. I would definitely stay at the Regent in Shanghai again. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Great place Spent there 2 nights in Aug 2007 and it's definitely lovely.What I care about in a hotel is cleanliness in the first place and The Regent Shanghai met my expectations; the room was clean, spacious and furnished with good taste.We were given a room at 50th floor (!) with an outstanding view on the city.Service was as good as you expect in a 4 star and the location, although not-so-close to the city center, is fairly good given that in Shanghai you can get a taxi to the Bund for about 3 euros.Definitely try it! "
the longemont shanghai ,"High Quality High Value Everything in this hotel feels spacious from the lobby to the rooms to the restaurant. We had reserved 2 deluxe rooms. Upon checkin we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a jr suite or studio. We chose the studio which provided us with a well appointed spacious corner room. The round glass shower stall overlooked the city, and all fixtures were high quality. A/C worked well. Lighting was okay but could have been better. Beds very comfortable. Service excellent. Our daughter's room was the deluxe - very good, though the upgrade to the studio was worth the money. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Re : You Get What You Pay For I tried out Regent Shanghai during my recent business trip to Shanghai.This is a brand new 5-star hotel in Shanghai that has opened for less than a year. It's located a bit outside of the central Shanghai area and within the residential and office district of Yan An Road. I was attracted to stay there due to the low price and promotion offer which is nearly 50% lower than other 5-star hotels in Shanghai. And Regent is a well known brand so I guess even if it is bad, shouldn't be that bad. Moreover, the rooms looks quite nice in the website photos. Well, let's just say the wise saying of &quot;cheap things no good things&quot; applies here. This hotel is notoriously inconsistent. A grand and beautiful lobby is matched with lousy rooms with lousy workmanship. The photos of the room may look good but if you are physically there to look at things closer, everything is poor quality. The plastic basins and tubs ( not ceramic ), the bare and plain room decor and that horrible shower cubicle which is both dark and claustrophobic. To make matters worse, water pressure is poor and that tea-plate size &quot;rainforest&quot; shower is not &quot;rain&quot; at all but just &quot;drizzle&quot; even when water volume is turned to max ( Conserve water to save cost? ). And for the first time ever, I saw a dirty basin in a supposedly 5-star hotel ( see photo ). The last time I saw a dirty basin was in a 3 star hotel in Jogjakarta more than 3 years ago. This speaks a lot on the poor housekeeping of this hotel. Yes, there is a plasma TV but it is no-name brand and the picture quality is so poor I didn't bother to watch it. This is a hotel room that just pretend to be high-end when it is actually not. The service is just as inconsistent. I met the rudest receptionist ever in the lobby when I wanted to checkin and for an instant I thought I was at a Chinese government ministry asking for directions ( and maybe they have better manners there! ). Fortunately, the rest of the staff were better. The club lounge is also mediocre and during the evening, it is so dark that you can't read. Breakfast served at the lounge is quite good though. Because the hotel is located in a residential and office area, there is no view to speak off. At night, all the lights are turn of.In conclusion, basically, it is a &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; kind of hotel. If you are going to Shanghai for business and just need a place to stay and a nice lobby to meet with guests, this hotel is OK. But if you are choosy and picky like me, don't fall for the cheap price and look elsewhere. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Wow. Stayed here for 4 nights and it was fabulous. The hotel staff can't do enough for you and the facilities are amazing. We bought some DVDs from Beijing and asked if could use a DVD player, which they gave us within 10 minutes (3 people turned up at the door to help) and told us it was free to use during our stay. The pool on the 26th floor is spectacular and you can do proper lengths in it. The food at breakfast and for their buffet dinner was a staggering choice, but expect hotel prices. The only SLIGHT downside was the location. It's a smoggy 10-15 minute walk to the rail station, but even so, a fabulous hotel. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Not staying there again I stayed there for 2 nights for a business trip. The hotel exterior does look nice. I don't like the location though. The area is too crowded and it's not easy to find dining and shopping around. The exception is a nice massage place across the street. For a fraction of the price they charge at the hotel spa, I had a very nice 2 hour massage. The service of the hotel staff was as bad as most of the Shanghai 5-star hotels. They seemed to be even more rude to their Chinese guests. I left the 'do not disturb' sign on my door when I left for meetings one day since I had a lot of papers lying around in the room. When I returned that night, I found the room was cleaned and all my papers were stocked in a pile. I can't say I appreciated the intrusion. That's a first since I usually get a voicemail message or a note under the door asking for permission to clean the room first. When I checked out, it took the concierge 30 minutes to have my bags taken downstairs. I actually had to sit in the cab for 15-20 minutes for my bags to arrive. Overall, not a business traveller friendly hotel and I will not stay there again. "
the longemont shanghai ,"Very Cool and Comfortable Hotel We stayed here in September as part of a 3 week spin through China and Japan. For 5 days we loved the Regent Shangahi. Get a corner suite -- the floor to ceiling bathroom view is amazing! Comfortable beds, awesome flatscreen TV's in all rooms (not just suites), an amzing brunch buffet with food from around the world, nice spa and work out room. Also -- the Regent Club on one of the upper floors can be &quot;joined&quot; for a reasonable rate per person and then you get free happy hour cocktails and free internet -- worth the price alone if you need to check e-mail for any amount of time. The only drawback here is possibly the location (not walking distance from downtown), but with the reasonable price of cabs, we could get almost anywhere for less than $3...just tell the concierge or doorman where you want to go and they'll write it in chineese, tell the taxi and you're off! "
the longemont shanghai ,"Good Service Regent Shanghai is one of the newest hotel in Shanghai. I stayed at the Deluxe room at 37/F which has a 180 degree city view (of course there's not a clear sky because of serious pollution). Room is comfy and spacious, bathroom is huge with a very chic bath tub and shower box. However, 42 inches Plasma seems to be too big for the room ! Selection of TV program is sufficient. Of course, if you are picky person, you can still find something &quot;need to be improved&quot; - get problem with the lighting, cleaness of housekeeping. Apart from it, it's all about quality of service ! Cannot complain about their service - staffs are able to speak fluent English and they are helpful, goodlooking (it's important too!) and polite even though you cannot speak Mandarin. They are willing to help to make reservation and explain to the taxi driver the place I wanted to go accurately. Don't worry about the location (I know some reviews mentioned about the inconvenient location), most of the drivers know where it is. Highway is nearby and it takes only 45 minutes from airport to hotel (costs RMD 160). "
the longemont shanghai ,"Bad Location Dont understand why one Tripadvisor member said the Regent is in a good location.There is virtually nothing in the neighbourhood of the hotel. No restaurants, shops (except a few convenience stores), subway stations. Must take a cab or bus which is a real annoyance during rush hours or rainy days. And not many cab drivers know this hotel.So must give them the directionThe hotel has very few guests during our stay (3 nights in early May). Room is not bad with fairly large bathroom. Local phone is cheap. Charged me 20 cents Rmb for a 2 minute local call but internet is expensive (Rmb 40 for 15 minutes)Wont pay Rmb160 for the buffet breakfast although the quality of which is not too bad.Service is efficient and polite particularly the bell boys and doormanWill consider staying this hotel again only if I can get a good rate or package(paid US$300 this time including return airfare HK-Shanghai-HK and 3 nights stay with daily breakfast) "
the longemont shanghai ,"Blew me away with its brilliance This is the new Regent Hotel which I believe only soft-launched at the end of last year. So only 180 of the 400 rooms were operating.This hotel is brilliant. The rooms have large landscape picture windows, they are spacious, have rain showers and baths. The panelled walls of the bathrooms slide open to create an open plan space, which is great for sitting in the tub and watching the Shanghai sky at night.The club lounge on the 48th floor is amazing, and affords spectacular views on multiple aspects.The ground floor has a bistro/bakery with eames chairs and egg chairs around a small water feature, as well as a number of coffee machines and traditional tea items in a contemporary setting, and the lounge bar opposite is purple in colour and uses mirrors to break up the space.I was really blown away, especially as I went on to spend a few nights at the much celebrate Grand Hyatt in Pudong, which I found a desperate let down.Stay here - the team are brilliant, it's worth it. I'm the most picky person I know and I had nothing bad to say about it. "
the longemont shanghai ,"All About the Details It is a truth universally acknowledged that what distinguishes an oustanding hotel from an average hotel is the detail of an operation.I decided to stay at the Regent Shanghai because of its ideal location, its supposedly stylish design, and the legendary service associated with the Regent brand name. Apart from the location, which is indeed excellent for both leisure and business travel, the facility and service arenas did not meet my expectations.Don't get me wrong. The Regent Shanghai did have the &quot;wow&quot; factor. I was very impressed with the spaciousness of the lobby. In my opinion, it was more grand than the Grand Hyatt Shanghai lobby, and it kind of reminded me of the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong lobby. And the rooms were very nice, equipped with a four-fixture bathroom and comfortable beds with divine duvets. But what failed were the details. Although the hotel was in its soft-opening stage, and the health-club just opened a few days before I checked in, the pool and fitness center smelled like new paint. And little stones left from the construction were still in the pool (I almost cut myself). Given that the hotel's new, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that things will improve as time goes by.What really annoyed me was the service. I came with high expecations as my service experience with Regent's late Hong Kong and Wall Street properties were stellar. However, during my stay, I saw F&amp;B managers walking with their arms folded and a smile-less housekeeper ordering us not to go into our rooms because she was cleaning. I don't expect service to be perfect during soft-opening, and I certainly don't expect service to be mind-blowing in China, but I expected more from the Regent brand.Regent Shanghai is by no means a bad hotel. As a whole, it reminded me of the Far Eastern Shangri-La in Taipei. With its location and physical layout, it definitely has the potential to become a significant player in the Shanghai luxury market. But like a great wine, it needs time to age. And with the proper supervision/management, it will undoubtedly flourish. "

the puli hotel and spa ,"i loved this hotel far away from the traditional heavy style hotels around the city.very kind personnel, beautiful stylish spacious &quot;studio&quot; rooms.amazing gym, pool and spa service.very close to the international shopping area and the domestic airport. i will come back for sure. "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Style and luxury at a bargain price We booked through expedia and stayed overnight before a return flight to the UK . The hotel has opened recently and some floors are not yet completed. So currently the prices are very reasonable for one of the most stylish and luxurious hotel I have ever experienced! Reception staff are exceptionally courteous and helpful-one even escorted us to a nearby restaurant when we asked for advice. The pool is spectacular. The rooms are large beatifully-designed and open plan with sliding door dividers eg to the window bath. Breakfast was included,and individually cooked.Overall a wonderful experience "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Fantastic Oasis Half the world away from the noise, pollution and queue-jumpers of Shanghai is the Puli. From the moment the receptionist said hello I felt able to relax - the staff really made the place, being happy to acquiesce to any request. The rooms are elegant and a modern wonder. Wall buttons control the blinds and window shutters - at the touch of a button the shutters slide away and the blinds roll with it. And the window seat is as comfortable as an old rocking chair. Some might say that the design of the room, with the open bathroom, isn't ideal but for a couple it is fine. Perhaps more of a problem is the building work going around in the hotel - when you leave the immediate area you step out into construction work. The masterplan for the area involves new buildings rising up in the sky all around so best to ask for a garden view room. But there are lots of great bars and restaurants nearby and this is a much better area to stay than the Bund. Oh and free internet in the lobby was supersonic and a real boon - we also stayed in the Peninsula where they charged an extortionate amount for it in their business centre. Not everyone brings a laptop on holiday so free access was great. "
the puli hotel and spa ,"still has to improve... I've had a preview of this new property just a few days after the opening and to be honnest, i had been ipressed by the exquisite design, very pure, relaxing and comfortable. The long bar is truly innovative, the pool and spa are like the most serene place to restore your mind after a busy day in this vibrant city and the rooms are large, well designed and perfectly comfy for a memorable stay. If i've had to resume, let's say The Puli is a perfect escape for top design and architecture and if this is your only expectation, you'll be not disappointed...However, as far as i'm concerned, i can't limit my expectations just to design and after a two nights stay at The Puli, i have to say i'm a bit disappointed...First of all, the property is really in the middle of the works and besides, try not to look too much around before to arrive right in front of thhe hotel because it's hard to imagone how a five stars hotel can welcome guests in such a mess full of dust and noise. Anyway, the hotel is still in the soft opening period and you can find very affordable offers but don't expect a nice area for now. However, the location is excellent, very central, close to the best malls of Shanghai and at walking distance from the nicest restaurants.But unfortunately, the messy area is not the main problem... The service itself is not trained enough and i don't think we can say China is not yet ready cause i've had a wonderful service experince at Park Hyaatt and i've waited the ssame from The Puli but it's not the case. Staff is nice but not professionnal enough and they hardly solve problems you could have, there is no concierge and the information we had from the front desk wasn't really good and at the restaurant, they don't inform you how it works cause there is a cold buffet with only sweet dishes but actually, you can order different other dishes from two menus, an asian one and a continental one. Both offer a good selection but the portions are ridiculous and if the breakfast is not included in your package, it can be a bit pricey. Moreover,if the staff at the front desk is smily, it's not the case at the restaurant and i think it's a bit unfortunate in a five stars...Same disappointement about room service...i highly recommand you to go out and eat a chinese snack if you're hungry at night. With my BF, we came back late from Hanghzou and we wanted to have something to eat in the room. We had decided to order a Puli burger but after more than 45 min (which is too long...), we have been extremly chocked by the portion. We even think they though it was an order for a 5 years kid and that's ridiculous. Moreover, our food was bit cold and sincerely not the sexiest burger we had... And as usual at The Puli, a little bit pricey.We had a disappointement as well at the pool which is open until 11pm and all the facilities have to be opened as well but when we went there, just the pool and the dry sauna were available. We wanted to have a steam and a jaccuzi but unfortunately most of the facilities were under maintenance... That's not acceptable from a five stars hotel even if it's still in the soft opening period. But let's say the pool is truly amazing...But this property has a very good potential and the rooms are fabulous, very large and overlooking a charming park by large windows. You'll find a state of the art equipment (flat screen, mobile phone, Ipod station, rain shower, deep bathtub with TV, electric blinds...) but honnestly, the lighting syste is a bit complicated and maybe you'll have to anticipate before to go to sleep. You'll find a free minibar as well as a free expresso machine but if these two very nice details are a proof of generosity, the welcome fruits are not good and so little and same problem in the bathroom with just one bottle of shower gel, shampoo and conditionner and a bit more of generosity would be highly appreciated.An other thing The Puli has to improve is the housekeeping cause on the first night, we came back in our room at 9pm and they didn't came back in the room for the turn down servce. I've decided to call them to inform them and they came right away but it's a bit embarassing and the cleanliness has to be perfect and finding a hair in the toilets is really not a good thing...Finally and maybe the worst problem is the soundproofing and as said an other tripadvisor member, not all the floors are opened yet and it's allready very noisy... But about this problem, i'm afraid nothing can be improved and it's regrettable...But let's give a bit of time to this property to rivalize with Park Hyatt or Peninsula. For now, a lot of improvement is needed and if you plan to stay in this high potential property, your stay will be average and you'll be a bit disappointed. So, better wait until this property will be fully opened and see if The Puli has his space in the world of the Shanghaiese five stars hotels... "
the puli hotel and spa ,"a great hotel in the making the hotel is stunning, very stylish and yet quite cozy. great ambience. given that it has only been opened for two months, the service is impressive. not the four seasons calibre but i can really feel that they are trying to make your stay comfortable and i truly appreciate the effort. i love the open space concept of the room. only complaint is the bed is not that comfortable in my opinion, the sheets are not frette quality and pillows not soft enough but i'm really spoiled by the four seasons beds. noise IS a problem though. there are a lot of construction going on so do book the rooms facing the park. there are still lots of noise like people talking loudly on the corridor and you definitely can hear the people moving chairs around on the floor above you. not quite sure how the hotel can solve this. i do worry when the hotel becomes more well known and has a higher occupancy rate. i get up late and the room service is willing to deliver certain items to my room at 1 p.m. and are very thoughtful. even room service the juice are freshly squeezed and the soft boiled eggs done perfectly. would still highly recommend this hotel and believe me i am picky. "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Expensive mediocre and completely avoidable I had the opportunity to stay at The Puli in Shanghai during the early part of November 09Overall, while the hotel does look nice, it has currently too many drawbacks that simply do not justify the expense of staying thereThe check in process is very smooth but that is the only positive thing I can say about my stay. Let me start with the room. The room is very stylish and elegant but not really practical. The bathroom is an open concept and once you use the glass doors to block off the bathroom, the room feels a very crampedThe work desk is more like a regular table and the chair isn't ergonomic and be warned if you plan to work at the desk for a couple of hoursThere is a 'free' minibar but it has just some soft drinks and a couple of bottles of cheap beerThe sinks in the bathroom are quite stylish but impractical. All the water splashes aboutThere is only one restaurant on the premises and the meal selection is very limited. So the only option is to brave the language barrier and go out for a meal by taxi. There isn't much in the area unless you walk to the Portman Ritz Carlton, which isn't so far but in the cold, can be an aggravating walkIn addition, the service at the restaurant needs huge improvement. On day 1, I arrived at the restaurant for breakfast at 6:15am, only to be turned away with the statement 'we open only at 6:30'. On day 2, suitably chastised, I arrived at 6:45 am. I was the only person in the restaurant. Despite that, it took over 15 minutes to get my omlette and it was cooked wrong. When I sent it back, it took another 20 minutes to return. All in all, 35 minutes for an omlette for the only customer in the restaurantThe room service menu is a bit larger in variety but be warned, the portions would leave even an anorexic hungryAnd yes, a final warning. This hotel does not have a money changer's license yet. So they can not change any money for you. The closest place therefore to get money post 5pm is the airport (an hour away). Seriously, that was what the front desk statedAll in all, a pretty hotel but at those rates, I'd rather stay at the Four Seasons or even The Portman Ritz Carlton "
the puli hotel and spa ,"The PuLi - five years in the making Finally this urban resort nestled between Jing An Park and the elevated Yan An highway in bustling Shanghai threw open its doors to the public just a few weeks ago. And first impression is…the delayed launch was well worth it! What was initially designed as an &quot;Exclusive&quot; property with club-like access to its F&amp;B outlets solely by residents was altered to welcome non-residents as well. Some of that feel still filters through with the walled garden environment surrounding the hotel and Club floors between levels 20 and 26 that suggest you are part of a select crowd.Managed by Urban Resorts Concepts, The PuLi is a member of the prestigious Leading Hotels of the World. It claims to be proudly traditional, distinctly modern. Interesting description. The PuLi was designed to be an oasis in the middle of the city. And it felt just that. It was really hard to find (a blessing perhaps) without a GPS navigator. (GPS reference: 31°13&quot;23&quot;N, 121°26&quot;39E Google Maps).The grey slate walls and bamboo trees lining the perimeter give an air of wonderful anonymity and emanate an almost zen-like feel as you enter the property.The lobby epitomizes the concept of lobby socializing where along one wall is a really l-o-n-g bar that is multi-purpose in design and operation. It’s a bar, a service counter and a Reception Desk in one. The rest of the area is made up of comfy lounge chairs, works of art and the floor to ceiling library complete with a diverse mix of books.The Reception counter is the first I’ve encountered that only uses Mac Books for workstations – there are 5 of them – black color and each one equipped with a Logitech Trackman Wheel mouse. Standing back and looking at the counter enveloped in dim lights, the illuminated and distinctive Apple logo on the back of the computer’s lid stood out. The symbol of cool, the Apple brand, was everywhere! I spotted at least five MAC users among the guests using the complimentary Wi-Fi in the lobby area. The Library is also home to an iMAC. Lucky I’m a MAC fanboy! A Speedtest of the Wi-Fi resulted in a 9Mb download speed and 10Mb upload speed – impressive.Inside the wood floored and stone walled guestroom, you will find plenty to keep you entertained, hydrated and comfortable.Fortunately, or unfortunately – this property has direct sunlight (even on a typical overcast Shanghai day). And if you like this kind of ambience, once you sit in the in-window sofa – you might be as well be in heaven. However, the direct sunlight brings a heating/cooling issue – so if you find the room a tad warm like I did, a quick flick of the switch labeled &quot;blinds&quot;, will instantly diffuse the light, and help cool the room down. Incidentally, it would have been a nice touch if the Receptionist &quot;Jimmy&quot; who escorted me to the room pointed out that the blinds could be closed for added comfort. I just wonder if Housekeeping partially close the window blinds after cleaning the empty room so as to help lower cooling costs?As dusk descended, the lights of Shanghai came alive from the surrounding buildings and passing cars.As is becoming commonplace in this type of property, there is a Nespresso Essenza coffee machine along with a few capsules. They were color-coded on the machines&quot; easy to follow operating instructions. A selection of organic teas included my new-found favorite – Chamomile Citrus. What a treat! The mini bar is free (filled with soft drinks, beer and juices – refilled once a day) and also a carton of fresh milk. A small bowl of fruit was provided (green apple, orange and kiwi – sadly no banana) along with some delightful chocolates. This was accompanied by a glass cloche-covered plate of delicious Brie cheese, cookies and half a fresh fig.The small bottle of 2004 Cotes Du Rhone will be a takeaway to be savored another day. The room had 8 bottles of distilled water (4 of which were pre-chilled in the fridge) – a great thought. However a more environmentally -friendly combination could have been one large bottle to pour and 4 small ones as back-up. One other pleasing touch would have been for Jimmy who took me to my room, to have offered to make me a coffee.It is important to note that this is the first hotel I have stayed where there is no phone in the toilet – only a power socket. Intriguing. They certainly future-proofed this room - there are 18 empty power sockets for you to choose from!The bathroom/bedroom are really as one, with a divider behind the bed, and sliding glass doors to give you that extra privacy, if needed. The big bath sits under the window, and is very inviting especially with the TV in front of it and side views of the city. There are two Villeroy &amp; Boch pedestal washbasins with joystick-like water control, and beside each one is a multi-function shaver socket and power socket for your BYO items, or to plug in the supplied Vidal Sasoon hairdryer.At each side of the double bed, above the nightstand, there are switches to control the lights, and two international power sockets for you to use. Below, the unit there is one more.Close by the bed is a Bose Wave radio with illuminated clock (handy to view at night) that has a CD inside labeled &quot;PuLi music&quot; – it had but one 4-minute track on it (ITunes [perhaps mistakenly] interpreted the title as: Ride &amp; Shake - MONSTER GRIP - Liquor Store Slaps) – which is the same background music playing on the ISTV system when you enter the room. Would have liked more tracks of this type of music. The room compendium is in the same rack and contains the &quot;Take Home Menu&quot; – a.k.a. Room Service.Inside one of the many cupboards, is a DVD player, and adjacent to it, a TECHNOLOGY KIT complete with four cables – VGA, Ethernet (although there&quot;s free Wi-Fi), RCA cables, and a male-male 3.5mm audio cable. Enough for the great majority of travelling folks, and the box has good illustrations and details how to use them all. Another cupboard houses the safe which is a good size and contains not only a power socket so you can charge your laptop, cell phone or camera, but also a light to see those all important diamond stud earrings. I could not find a torch.The desk sits beside of one of the windows, and the view is either over the highway below, or the 32&quot; Sharp Aquos LCD TV – which incidentally is mounted on a pull out swing bracket allowing easy viewing from almost anywhere in the room including the toilet cubicle providing you don&quot;t mind the lack of privacy by leaving the door open. There&quot;s some good functionality on the TV such as weather, World Clock, flight arrivals and departures, City info and Currency Exchange rates. You can also find Hotel info along with some movies and music on demand.Opening the desk drawer reveals a varied selection of stationery supplies and an elegant ballpoint pen. This is the second hotel I’ve encountered in as many weeks that have stocked-up on pens that are consistent with the image the hotel wants to project. It came with a black color pencil made from recycled newspapers and magazines whose days, I fear, with the release of eBook readers, are numbered. More on that subject another time.Beside the desk are more power sockets and receptacles to plug in all your gizmos using the cables supplied in the Technology kit. Some may find it a tad low but the hotel had design issues that needed to be addressed. I still think it works. Unlike many hotel rooms these days there is just one phone by the bed (Alcatel), and to be honest, I’m not sure that the average traveler needs more when most now prefer to use their mobiles. The hotel also provides a mobile phone that can be used in-room or anywhere in Shanghai – so you are never far away from the hotel or your room. Calls made from the unit will be charged back to your room account.The wooden floors did not bother me since most times I like to walk around either in my socks, or bare feet. For those who may be concerned over cleanliness, disposable slippers are provided. It may a good idea if staff wore soft-soled shoes to stop the noise created by their heels or soles resonating on the stone or wooden floors. Old fashioned Chinese slippers could go well with their interesting Chinese-worker style uniforms.At the rear of the Long Bar is The Garden, which has a resort-like aura. Lined with bamboo trees, the area gives an air of tranquility. Apart from the distraction of the occasional car horn and wafting techno music, you could almost imagine you are in a Balinese garden complete with l-o-n-g water pool. Wi-Fi is available in the garden.I went there around 6pm and the sun had already set. There was a bit of a breeze which gave me a slight chill. But I was determined to stay outdoors to smoke a cigar. A pre-dinner Bloody Mary seemed right to kick-of the evening. And this came with salted roasted almonds, olives and wasabi peas. In the rush to get there, I’d forgotten to pack my cigar torch, and had to make do with the supplied matches that were tough to use because of the wind. Maybe worthwhile for the hotel to invest in a cigar torch.Dining in the second floor Jing An restaurant was a real treat. The room was beautifully decorated and carried through the wood theme found all over the property.A few highlights of the meal were the warm bread rolls accompanied by butter pots of foil wrapped salted or un-salted Beurre Echiré -- a real favorite!For a starter, I had Foie Gras with Smoked Chocolate (amazing tasting combination), and the main course was Lamb Noisette with Pomegranate sauce. As a dessert I chose the Artisan Cheese plate with jam. These were topped off by a cafetière of Chamomile Citrus Tea and Petits Fours. My only comment about the meal is to use less parsley for garnish – it was on all three of my ordered dishes. Also, quite impressively the waiter knew the names of the cheeses, however, he openly admitted that he did not know which was which.For those of you who like working out or relax, the Spa and Fitness area located on level 2 have probably everything you need. There is the beautifully laid out Anantara Spa, a Technogym-equipped gym, and a 25m long swimming pool that has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the park for the entire length of the pool.Even though the hotel is partially open and scheduled to be all ready by December, I’m told they are running full occupancy. It’s no wonder then that when I went for Breakfast at around 0930 the room was very busy.After being quickly seated and served coffee, I was directed to help myself to the buffet where you can choose from juices to include fresh watermelon, at least 12 types of pastries plus breads, yoghurt, fresh and dried fruits (such as cranberries) and cereals.I couldn’t help but notice the fresh granola bars and beigels, and sampled them both. The granola bars were soft and crumbly, and I was pleasantly surprised by the exploding flavors as you bit into them. The taste of the top part of beigel which I had toasted was reminiscent of Welsh Rarebit, and the bottom half was crispy and chewy - delicious especially when coated in Beurre Doux unsalted butter and some of the preserves (jam, honey and marmalade) provided on the table in nice little white pots.For the Yoghurt, I mixed this with various nuts and seeds, and some fruit puree – Yum!Main course was à la carte, and I opted for the omelette with smoked salmon – another particular favorite of mine. The presentation was great (apart from the green parsley again) and I lightly dusted it with salt flakes presumably Himalayan found on the table along with the Peugeot pepper mill.Choosing a seat facing out of the window, I overlooked the park and could catch glimpses of people enjoying some Sunday relaxation and a couple of joggers, perhaps getting ready for the hearty Meat Pie lunch promotion at The PuLi.Just before checkout, I imbibed some more delicious tea in the Long Bar while using the Wi-Fi. This time, I asked for Chrysanthemum and the giant flowers inside the cafetière were most beautiful against the backdrop of the purple flowers on the table.The PuLi could perhaps be described as eye candy for the soul, and restful to the mind and body. Job well done guys - finally!Photos: http://www.flickr.com/photos/27621015@N08/sets/72157622532142089/show/ "

the puli hotel and spa ,"5 Star Hotel with 5 1/2 Star Service We stayed at this wonderful hotel from Oct 17 to Oct 21. Check in was very efficient and we were given a city facing room. A host of the hotel accompanied us to our room and talked about the facilities within the hotel and explained how everything worked (ie. cappuccino machine, safe, etc). We were pleasantly surprised that all drinks in the room were complimentary. As described with their web site the rooms were very large and well appointed. Top of the line finishing was noted through out the suite (ie. Villeroy and Boch sinks and toilets). According to my wife, the dual ionizing hair drier worked well. The bed was comfortable and a variety of pillows were available. The water pressure was good for all the water fixtures. The flat screen television was mounted on a swiveling bracket so the TV could be moved to face most areas of the room. The writing table was well equipped. There were plenty of closet space to store your second suit case and any other items that you may have accumulated during your travels. As there is construction on the East side you do hear a little noise in the evening. We were moved to the West side (Garden facing) of the hotel on our last 2 days and the noise issue was resolved. Service by all staff members was excellent. Staff were always able to full fill any requests made and did so with a smile. The business center had free use the internet on the Apple computers and even had bottled water at each station. The sanitation of the rooms and the property was excellent. If breakfast is included, you order a hot meal a la carte with a cold meal buffet. Although people recommended other hotels located in more popular areas I have no regrets staying at the Puli. The Puli is only located a short 3-5 minute walk to the Ji Ann Temple station. Overall, the Puli is one of the best for service and for the facility. "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Perfection does exist After a very delayed flight into Shanghai and a terrifying taxi ride from the airport, the combination of which left us worse for wear, we arrived at The Puli at 1am. And we promptly felt a whole lot better! The bellboy opened the door, the manager in charge was there to greet us and the concierge was waiting with a bouquet of roses that reminded my wife of her wedding bouquet. We were upgraded and, as they knew that our stay was part of our honeymoon trip, chocolate truffles and a bottle of Moet and Chandon were waiting for us. To make a long story short - the lobby is breathtaking, the room gorgeous, the staff is exceptionally well trained, and nothing is too much trouble (we had someone helping us to choose between their 5 pillow options, and with good humor). The swimming pool is brilliant; first indoor infinity pool I've ever seen. The hotel manager made it a point to introduce himself to us and seemed to be around much of the time. The whole place had a very personal feel and the management and staff really put in the effort to make us happy. It is such a difference from a typical chain hotel experience. The concierge desk is quite impressive. All of the staff there really know what they are talking about and are ready to recommend anything you might need in Shanghai. They use a very cool computer system to show you exactly where things are located in the city. If you come to enjoy nightlife in Shanghai, the person you should know is Chris from the concierge team. He knows what you need even when you have trouble explaining it. He managed to get us into a members only club, which is apparently the place to be in Shanghai, where we had quite a good time. I am really trying hard to find something wrong about this hotel... The one thing is that the cocktails at the bar were not up to par. But while we were there, we did see a gentleman training the staff in the art of cocktail mixing, so I don't doubt this will improve. We typically favor boutique hotels for their personal service. The Puli is a great combination because it certainly provides the individual attention, but it is a large hotel with all the amenities you might need. I would recommend it for business and pleasure, and I definitely want to go back. "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Deluxe Oasis in the city Just returned from a week in China where we stayed in the brand new Puli Hotel &amp; Spa. If you don't need Bund view and view of Pudong Skyline the location of the Puli in the Jing An district is excellent. The Metro is around the corner, a nice chinese park and temple behind the hotel and excellent shopping/nightlife within easy walking distance (5-10min). Don't worry about the contruction side opposite the hotel (building of 2 new Shangri-la hotels) -ask for a room with park view - because in this city there is construction everywhere (area around Park Hyatt and Grand Hyatt is a desaster and the Bund is closed the next months due to refurbishment). Back to the Puli - you enter the Lobby through a pathway with water and chinese Art and in the Lobby you immediately feel completely out of the bustling city. Candles, quiet music, water and dark wood with a completely new atmoshere. (Forget JW Marriott and Four Seasons, think about Aman Hotels) - this is the style of the next decade. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are just great - bathroom and bedroom combined but easily to be separated by a sliding wall, huge rain shower, bathtub with city views, LCD TV with DVD, BOSE sound system and a comlimentary minibar with Nespresso machine. The SPA is also great, especially the huge indoor pool (5x25m) with daybeds and views....you will never go to another hotel in this city, "
the puli hotel and spa ,"Great service incredible staff Although this hotel is not open as yet, the interaction I've had with the staff there has been nothing but pleasant. We had reserved a room for this past weekend but the hotel did not open in time so they very generously compensated us by arranging a room in another nearby hotel, paying for our breakfasts, offering us free pick-up and drop-off services, free minibar, etc. They also sent us a hand-written letter apologizing and the director of sales visited us at our chosen hotel to apologize. The level of service we have encountered so far leads me to believe that a stay there will be very pleasant and I look forward to it in the future. "
the westin bund center ,"Rather Expensive for The Room Size If the price was reduced by say USD 20 to USD 30, I would say it is reasonable. The Hotel itself is good, however, the room is very tightly layed-out. Bed, TV, coffee table, writing table, tiny luggage bench and a bed, all seemed to be squeezed into a small space! Very compact for such a large property. The service at the Front Office when I check-in was swift and professional. My queries for information on internet service and late check-out till 2pm were immediately understood and responded.The breakfast service was also prompt and efficient. Our coffee was continually refilled. The downside of the breakfast service was the layout of the buffet spread. I walked 3 rounds and could not find the juices. Eventually, I asked the service staff and was told that the juices were at the entrance! It was totally cut-off from the entire food and fruits line, and it was also beyond the greeters desk, definitely a first of my many experiences in a hotel. Recommended if you are visiting offices in the complex, as it is convenient. Otherwise, the various hotels in the Pudong Area might be better in terms of choices, cost and the room comfort. "
the westin bund center ,"Nice Business Hotel in Shanghai nice business hotel in the heart of shanghai.. seems to be quite full even during work days, all the restaurants in the hotel are full most of the time.. stayed there for 3 nights and had very good service from the hotel.. only 5 blocks away from nanjiang shopping district.. "
the westin bund center ,"Stay at the Hilton not the Westin On a suggestion to break out of my regular routine I decided to change hotels. I am in Shanghai 4 to 6 times a year. I spend 5 to 6 months in China and Taiwan, I usually stay at the Hilton when in Shanghai. Some told me to try the Westin. I did, I suggest you don’t. After a 16 hour flight, a hellish drive here, I’m greeted with wait sir let me help someone who came in after you, oh wait, let me help another person who came in after you. I get to my shoe box size room and wait for my bags. And I wait, and I wait. I called, they said on the way up, and I wait. I thought I go have a drink in the executive lounge, oh no sir you don’t have access. I’m a Platinum SPG member. Sorry sir. First I would hate to see standard room, second I would hate to see how they treat non-high level SPG members. Internet is not free. Horrible stay, I checked out after one day, went back to Hilton, where they treat you like you should be treated I’ll just build hhonors points instead of SPG points. A great location, a beautiful Lobby and good restaurants is not a good enough trade off for internet for a fee, no executive treatment and tiny, tiny, tiny room at 3 times the cost! Stay elsewhere!!! "
the westin bund center ,"Choose an other one! Unfriendly staff. Bad, to say the least, breakfast. Never again!!We wrote a complaint and we still wait for the answer! "
the westin bund center ,"Pleased with our stay. The Westin is a quick walk to the Bund which is currently under construction. It is about a 15 minute walk to Peoples Square ,the Urban and planning Museum and the Shanghai Museum as well as Nanjing Street for shopping. The lobby is more modern with an attempt at looking tropical with palm trees in the middle bar area. There are several restaurant/eatery choices which were all very good. Our room had a living area that could be closed off from the sleeping area giving our daughter privacy with her, as she said, &quot;comfy&quot; rollaway bed. The bathroom was a nice size with seperate tub and shower. The shower was great..it was a rain shower. The room had free internet. "
the westin bund center ,"Fine Hotel Traveled with a land/cruise tour. Finished the tour in Shanghai. Hotel was lovely. Room with 2 beds was huge, bathroom also huge. Business center was always available, service was prompt. Bottled water was always promptly brought if we needed more. Had a corner room, &amp; watching the traffic &amp; accidents was entertaining while it rained. Buffet meals were excellent, though it was hard to find all the offerings as the offerings went into other areas. Dining area has lots of steps so was particularly difficult for handicapped folks and tricky to manuveur through if one wasn't handicapped. "
the westin bund center ,"Usual Westin standard exec floor good slow on service though Well placed for walking to Yuan Bazaar and Gardens, the Bund ( an expo 2010 building site at the moment), restaurants, etc. There are plenty of small 7/11 type stores directly opposite the hotel too. Taxi rank on site. Close to metro system.Stayed on the 22nd Exec floor which offered a well equipped room. Usual heavenly bed, computer station (great plug system which lets you plug any type of electric item from anywhere in the world straight in), small fridge/in room bar, safe, chaise, really lovely bathroom with separate shower and bath. Nice well lit roomy cupboard and drawers for clothing, plus drawers for your toiletries in the vanity, something most &quot;trendy&quot; hotels forget these days!Concierge was helpful, always get them to write down where you are going in Chinese before you leave the hotel, and remember to take the hotel's Chinese printed info for getting back. Most taxi drivers do not speak English in Shanghai. Concierge organised reheeling of a shoe which was very efficient. Organised restaurant bookings also, especially for some of the smaller local type of Mom and Pop restaurants we decided to try which have no English at all (try a Sichuan Hot Pot restaurant - it is mindblowing!).Ate at the Italian restaurant in the hotel one night as a dairy food craving came over us after being in China for a while, but unfortunately can't recommend it. Think Olive Garden run by Austin Powers. We had a 25 mins wait for our bill after asking twice and being ignored. Not exactly up to standard. Also had a problem waiting 20 mins for a drink at the bar in the atrium area, even though there were very few people in the bar and staff were standing around vacantly. However we had breakfast from the a la carte menu on our last day and the service was excellent. There is a small cafe which makes lattes and sandwiches which we ate breakfast in most days. Service is OK, we had to ask for hot coffee as it was usually tepid, but the sandwiches are nice.The pool facility is OK, you have to hire a swimming cap, and the pool isn't deep, but it is nice to swim looking at the nightlit skyscrapers. Didn't use the business facilities as they charged extra. Odd that you are staying on the exec floor on business and they ding you for use.Overall OK hotel. Would stay again for rooms, not for restaurants or business centre. "
the westin bund center ,"Top Quality hotel No ifs or buts, this was a thoroughly enjoyable stay in an attractive and very comfortable hotel. We ate there each evening at a very good Italian restaurant , and we also enjoyed breakfasts and cocktails. Both front desk and Concierges were very helpful. I'd be happy to stay here again. Our room was very comfortable, well laid-out and interestingly designed.A word about Shanghai though. The Bund, maybe their biggest tourist attraction is completely boarded off to pedestrians whilst they put the road underground in preparation for a major trade fair next year. You cannot walk along or even see the river from the Shanghai side and whilst you can walk along next to the buildings that form the Bund but its dusty, its building site, and you can't appreciate the buildings from right underneath. Similary Pudong is a building site. It looks fine from the river - a river cruise is about the only way you're going to see the Pudong skyline or the Bund. Once there however the extent of construction is more than aopparent, nowhere more so than from the observation platforms of the high towers on the Pudong side. Traffic is pretty congested, and getting around for excursions etc is sometimes painfully slow. "
the westin bund center ,"loved the westin bund center we got a great rate, the rooms were a decent size for a city. it was centrally located. the staff was amazing. yes, the breakfast buffett was a little pricey, but so worth it. although, we didn't eat sunday brunch, we were in the lobby when it was going on, it was complete with an orchestra and opera singers - it was amazing! the gym and spa were also great. i don't have a bad thing to say about this hotel. i would totally recommend it, as well as stay there again. "
the westin bund center ,"Great place best on my China trip great location, super friendly staff, to SPA is great, it has his price but unforgetable!Nice Breakfast buffet. very good concierge desk they help you with all needsWill be back! "
the westin bund center ,"Not value for money I expected more from this hotel. Apart from the location, very little else to comment postively. There was a lack of information in the rooms regarding restuarants and facilities; apart from the Spa service. This was very over priced, as was the food including breakfast! $40 for a breakfast buffet in China! "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent hotel with great service The staff was very attentive and the decor of the lobby was unique, with twin glass staircases lit with colors which cycled every few minutes. The breakfast buffet was excellent, offering everything from American to traditional Chinese foods. The group we were traveling with stayed at some very nice hotels across China but this was by far the best. "
the westin bund center ,"Third Successful Meeting I arrange meetings for the group I manage and we go to Shanghai for a week every October and are returning this year. The guestroom costs may be a bit on the high side, but for a meeting planner, the meeting space, F&amp;B assistance, food quality and responsiveness of the staff rank very high, not to mention the central location. I also plan meetings in Europe and the US (3 meetings in all each year) and this is the only venue that will remain unchanged for coming years. We alternate the European and US locations between cities, but not the Westin Bund. My group has been very satisfied. "
the westin bund center ,"As expected Westin standards but let down with concierge advice Stayed there in early Jan ( 1- 2 weeks before chinese new yr (CNY).) Upgraded us to junior suite. Room fantastic. - huge, nicely decorated and spacious shower room. Generally as what I expected from Westin stays. Walking distance to the bund. Everything was ok with 1 let down. We were seeking advice from 1 young chinese lady at concierge, Westin Bund, on train station to Suzhou ( west bound) but she misguided us to another train station to Hangzhou ( south bound). We reached there to find out huge, huge crowd due to crowds/workers going home for CNY. Struggled through the crowd and waited at tickets counters only to find out we were at wrong station. Wasted our half day. So becareful and check properly the correct station and not tottaly depends on their advice "
the westin bund center ,"awesome awesome trip to china this is very nice place to stay staff is amazing, very well located a got a great rate by a mexican agency called viajeshelvetia.com. Hotel has lots of amenities and great views. "
the westin bund center ,"Amazingly convenient comfortable Have just returned from a 4-night stay at The Westin Bund. It was amazing! Extremely comfortable, luxurious and obviously expensive!The hotel is self-contained and it's very easy to forget that there's a big city to see! There are numerous restaurants, bars, a fitness centre and a fabulous spa (which my husband and I highly recommend!) The staff speak excellent english and go out of their way to help. There is loads of info on offer to help with trips and whilst they are expensive, they're organised very well.Our room was also massive! Bigger than our flat at home we worked out! The bed is extremely comfortable and the shower was amazing. All the creature comforts.I know it's an obvious thing to mention, but it's just worth bearing in mind.....everything is extremely expensive. For example, a coffee is £8 and to get a pair of pants washed costs £4. My husband and I have very little self-restraint so spent a fortune!! There was only one thing that upset me a little at the hotel. My husband was approached on 3 occasions by escorts in different parts of the hotel. I didn't mention this to the hotel, but regret this and would next time. The cynic in me says the hotel is aware of this, but I'd like to believe otherwise and don't know for sure. There is obviously a lot of money being thrown around The Westin and there are a lot of business men.......Overall, a great stay and we'd go back (if we ever have the money again!!) "
the westin bund center ,"Ovepriced not 5 star quality I spent 6 nights here as my first time in Shanghai. I was originally going to go with the Grand Hyatt but this hotel seemed to be better situated on the Puxi side, close to People's Square, Nanjing Road, Yu Gardens and the airport, as well as closer to the train stations. I had booked the hotel through hotels.com and I've upgraded myself to one of the newer rooms for something like 120 yuan more per night. However, I was not impressed at all with the room decor; it all seemed tacky and not warm at all - more like 3 star quality. There were just ceiling spot lights and 2 table lights by the bed which created a very bright atmosphere. The bathroom actually kept bumping into the desk whenever it was wide open (slide door). A room advantage is that they're reasonably big so you won't be short for space. I stayed on the 11th floor.The bed was harder than in other Westin hotels I stayed at and the toiletries (shampoo, shower gel and body lotion) were of poor quality.The room service was great, though bad value for money. Don't get me wrong, I've even stayed at four seasons in the past and I know what a good value for money is.The main restaurant closes after 2pm so anyone wanting to have a late lunch... well bad luck! You can just buy some sandwiches (which are good and I would recommend for a cheap breakfast) from the &quot;Treats&quot; shop downstairs. I had some snacks in the lobby and I was originally refused a second cup to share the tea pot with my friend, which I found a bit rude.The location was nice, with great views in all directions.So overall, if you want to stay here, don't expect your stay to be cheap even though the original hotel rates may be lower than in other places. These rooms are the worst I've ever seen in a 5 star rated hotel even though you can argue that the location makes up for it. I personally wouldn't stay here again. I just had to register to write this review, I hope it helps everyone! "
the westin bund center ,"Amazing hotel - has just about everything you could need! After a crazy 5 day trip to Hong Kong and a late arrival in Shanghai, I was pleasantly surprised to find work had booked me in to such an amazing hotel.It has great restaurants, a fantastic lobby with a staircase that looks as though it should be in a ballroom, different bars, a spa which is out of this world and the rooms are fantastic. I would have liked to have stayed for longer than the 10 days but it was very expensive and the formula 1 was in town so the prices went up too far!The only thing is the price but I guess thats what you pay for quality.Also the Sunday Brunch is something you should experience at least once but you do have to book in advance. "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent if you have a short time in town Excellent location. I would recommend staying here if you only have a short time in Shanghai and would like to see a bit of the city (People’s square, Nanjing Rd, The Bund). Rooms were on a par with other Westin hotels I’ve stayed in (that’s to say excellent). Based on the prices of coffee in the lobby area (around 80 rmb), I’d recommend dining elsewhere – there are plenty of choices. The Banyan tree spa in the hotel has been recommended by friends – purported to be the best spa chain in Shanghai. Check in times are 2pm. Receptionists speak good English. If you’re getting in early, you should let the hotel know - we arrived at 12 and had to sit around for an hour. Taxis too/from Hongqiao airport cost approx 50 rmb; to/from Pudong airport approx 250 rmb "
the westin bund center ,"awesome fantastic center of town, walking distance to everything, beautiful view, so clean, awesome smell of the lobby, hallway &amp; the rooms "
the westin bund center ,"One of the best Title say it all, location service and lobby. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. You can step out of the hotel and within a few minutes you are quite literally in the heart of everything. Go and enjoy. "
the westin bund center ,"The staff here really goes out of their way to be helpful Stay here for 4 nights with family after reading extensively previous positive reviews on Trip Advisor and also feedback from colleauges who have stayed here. I must agreed with all others that this hotel deserves all the accolades it has received so far. Lobby is gorgeous and can best be appreciated at nights and also during Sunday's brunch when a live orchestra plays beautiful classical music. Only shame is hotel lacks a high floor bar/restaurant to take in the City view or the Bund at night. One other improvement that it can use is better insulation of the individual shower stalls in the bathroom to prevent water splash from leaking out and wetting the marble floor( hence a safety hazard as one can easily slip/fall if not careful).Highest marks must go to all hotel staff, especially the Concierge desk headed by Ken X. He and his crew went above/beyond to help us feel at home- from arranging private piano practice time/space for my two sons who are both high caliber pianists, to spending countless hours reviewing surveillance tape to trackdown whereabouts of my missing camcorder off a taxicab, to answering numerous questions for locations/hours on shopping/dining establishments. I think their relentless pursuit of the highest quality service possible makes our stay a truly 5 Star experience.Must also give very high marks to a gorgeous pool with swimming lanes on the 3rd floor which my family and I have enjoyed it immensely during the length of our stay. "
the westin bund center ,"An excellent option I've travelled to Shanghai often and have had a chance to stay at the Westin on a couple of occassions.Its very close to the Bund and therefore if your meetings are on the other side, you need to factor in an hour of travel.The rooms are very nice and just right sized. The bathrooms are unusual with free standing tubs that one can soak in.The food options are varied and uniformly decent. The buffet breakfast is really worth the price with excellent options. Take the trouble to try out the home made yogurt. The lounge is a good place to relax in the evening.The service on the whole is very professional.An excellent international standard choice in Shanghai "
the westin bund center ,"Enjoyed my staying there! a really great hotel, friendly staff, great food, I would say just perfect.Ok almost the whole Bund is under construction so take your face mask with you!!! "
the westin bund center ,"this must be one of the best hotels in China I paid $800/ night (which is a bargain) and stayed there for 2 nights; this a true 5 star hotel by any standard.I stayed on the SPG preferred guest floor, and as soon as you walked in the room you smell a nice aroma. It's so close to Bund. Great service, professionally trained staff.Just can't find enough words to say good thing about this hotel. "
the westin bund center ,"Stupendous beds right in the midst of Shanghai I stayed here for three nights at the start of May, taking advantage of the Labour Day weekend. Although we arrived at the same time as a whole coachload of tourists, we got checked in quickly and up to the room.The room was great; split into two with a sliding partition, with an incredibly comfortable bed. Westin is marketing this as the 'Heavenly' bed and that's a pretty apposite superlative; I could have quite happily stayed in bed all weekend (although that would have meant missing out on Shanghai). There's two televisions, a DVD player so you don't have to just watch whatever films are on the hotel channel, and although we didn't have a view across the river, we did have one across the rooftops of the Bund - just as interesting to look out and see birds flying around and people out on the tops of the buildings. Bathroom was excellent: huge freestanding bath and a good powerful shower, although the toilet paper was quite cheap quality.Room service was prompt and very good quality; breakfast in the executive lounge was also of a good variety, especially the doughnuts (on the other hand the croissants were pretty much rock hard). Prices for other services seemed a bit steep to me - close to 1000 RMB for a massage, when you're in Shanghai and could get the same for 50 if you weren't in the hotel, but I suppose the kind of person who pays for 1000 RMB of spa treatment isn't the same kind of person who just wants to get wrenched about for an hour by an unspeaking Chinese masseuse. Sunday brunch is meant to be the best in town, but again, a little pricey. Then again, I wasn't drinking this weekend; if I had been, 418RMB for all the champagne I could force down myself would probably be a bargain.Location is great - although at the present time the Bund has construction work on it (they're building a new promenade) so although you can walk to the Bund, you can't see the river. Then again, you're near all sorts of other interesting buildings (HSBC, the central post office, and so on) so it's not a complete disaster.Signage in the hotel can be a little confusing from time to time. We were in the Office Tower (there's also the Grand Tower on the other side of the atrium) and then spent some time wandering up and down escalators looking for the business centre. Other than that, the place is great. "
the westin bund center ,"Very Good Hotel in Greta Location Over the last 4 years I have stayed at the Westin Bund Center three times. The rooms, service, restaurants, and facility are what you would expect of a five star hotel. The only bad thing I could say is that the prices are high. When visiting Shanghai you can not go wrong with this hotel. "
the westin bund center ,Excellent Hotel and Excellent Service The property was great and had a great view. The reception was very helpful and also gave tips on how to overcome the language barrier. I am a strict vegetarian so the breakfast buffet could have been completely off bounds for me had it not been for the helpful chef who personally pointed out every single eggless dish and also made a few things just for me. Great stay. 
the westin bund center ,"Decent hotel but not great My sister and I went to shanghai for 3 days over easter, my third time in Shanghai. Having stayed at Four Seasons the past two times, we thought we'd try Westin which is closer to the bund. We had a room with two beds, and I am not sure if all the rooms are like ours, but the one we had was in a corner (901) and had a strange layout. The room felt crowded, as was the bathroom, and definitely a lot smaller than the other Westins I have stayed in China and other countries. The worst part of the room though was the thin wall. Our neighbours seem to be a TV addict and had their TV on from 9am to late at night, and I could hear everything on their TV as if it was in my own room. However, these flaws aside, the hotel is quite reasonably priced for its class. The staff and concierge were very helpful. The hotel is not located in dead central shanghai, but rather is within walking distance to the bund, which was ideal for us - coming back to the hotel from the bars at night near the bund was convenient. A short US$2 cab ride to yue yuen and xin tian di. Overall, not a bad hotel, but if I went back to Shanghai again, I would probably stay at Four Seasons instead. "
the westin bund center ,"Baby! - this is 5 star as it should be! My colleague and I spent 2 nights at this hotel. It was close to our customers and priced well (we got an excellent on-line rate direct with the hotel). The first thing that struck me when I walked in was the Atrium lobby - oh my goodness....the stairways frame a perfect island of seats to sit and chat / drink and prepare for dinner or meetings. The stairways are lit in different colours at night and the grand restaurants that surround it are a creation in themselves.We dined at a superb Buffet at the ground floor restaurant. The price was reasonable and the selection large. Ask for the big &quot;red seats around a round table&quot; - your conversation is well shared as these chairs shield out the noise form other tables!. Western, euro and eastern tastes are catered for. The staff are subtle and well trained. I was lucky enough to find some New Zealand Green Lipped mussels and I was amazed, in heaven and impressed - fresh too.Breakfast buffet is 5/5 in terms of quality. Don't drink the standard coffee if you like coffee - ask for an espresso or your favourite and you'll be surprised how quick it arrives.Anyhow the room I had was 1716 - its a large room (normally double the size of a normal Hotel room) with a lounge that takes up half the space, bedroom is quarter size and bathroom is the other quarter. Big bath, rainforest shower, &quot;Westin heavenly bed&quot; (which is the reason I always love the Westin), spacious lounge, great working desk with international plugs and tons of storage. A dumb thing in the lounge though is the very large glass box containing a very large glass tube (AKA old style TV). Internet is via cable and although it was free in my room rate, it confused me when it asked me to pay (the system is silly). The wireless is via ChinaNet but very unreliable. Free also around the hotel.Finally, we checked out on a Sunday and missed the brunch (we checked out at 1pm) but we saw the following - it costs around US$90 with free flow champagne (Mumm) and a huge selection of incredible food. Kids are catered for with games, popcorn and candy floss area and there are some cool crafts people doing local art to &quot;give away(?)&quot;. If you read my Bangalore West End Taj review, you can see what I mean by awesome - this one beats West End!We checked out and there was a minor bill dispute on a tour we took (sadly the person who booked it made a major stuff up and refused to lose face on it so we &quot;ate it&quot;) but just make sure you check your bill. Errors seem to be a habit of every hotel I stay at.Conclusion - I'll make sure I'm back - this place is perfect for location, price, facility, service and value. Go there if you can afford it (and given the current economic situation, you should get a deal). "
the westin bund center ,"Relax Recharge Revitalize After a long anticipated wait, i finally arrived in the Westin Bund Centre Shanghai.First sight was very impressive. The moment you entered the hotel, there was some pleasant smell.I might sound weird, but yeah, I have never been in a hotel with such good smell before.The check-in was very quick, and before i knew it, i was up in my room.The room was beautifully appointed, as you can see in the pictures. I booked a &quot;Grand Crown Deluxe&quot; room, which obviously is in the Grand Tower.I Kinda doubt that the impressive crown building was really a hotel, apart from those high class suite being there.Service wise, it was pretty good. The &quot;0&quot; Express Service pretty much solve all ur needs. They also answer the call with my surname, which most of the time got my name wrong.Room service was almost excellent. I said almost excellent because there was hair in one of my food, although the hotel was quick to fix the problem.Tea and Coffee facillity in the room is really good. Not instant coffee but, real coffee powder.Eating at Prego is a MUST.The bubsiness centre was very helpful and went out of their way to help me recharge my phone.A little down side was that, one night i was unable to sleep until 8 am (just me not feeling tired). I locked the door and switch on the Do not disturb sign.At about 1.45 pm I receive a call asking me when do i want my room cleaned. Maybe its just me, but isnt the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign means Do not disturb?But yeah, this is a minor problem.Overall, the hotel is great, beautiful, clean and luxurious. But in comparison to my expectation, they did fell slightly below it. I mean, for this price, i expect better.Dont get me wrong though, its still very good. "
the westin bund center ,"Good Business Hotel that delivers The Westin hotel in Shanghai is a 5-star business hotel, located at Puxi within walking distance of the famous Shanghai Bund Area. This is my first time staying at a Westin and they are offering a relatively competitive rate under the “Winter Promotion” program. December is usually the low season for Shanghai so most hotels have some kind of promotion. ArrivingI was picked up by a hotel staff upon exiting the airport terminal and escorted to my limousine. I wasn’t that pleased with the quality of the car, which despite being Audi A6, feels rather bumpy. Also making matters worse was that my driver was speeding, due to some miscommunication. Upon arrival at the hotel, a hotel lady staff escorted me to my room after the check-in formalities. The RoomI booked a standard deluxe room at the newer Grand Tower wing which on paper is about 38m2 but the actual room feels bigger and is a corner room. Not sure if it is an upgraded room type. The bedroom is tastefully decorated, functional if not very luxurious. There is a good size glass working desk with assortment of plugs and internet connection both wired and wireless is free for all hotel guest. The internet speed is fast. This will pleased business travelers who probably make up the majority clientele of this hotel. There’s also a sofa daybed by the window. There is however, not much of a view to speak off except a partial size view of the Pearl Tower. The hotel is in close proximity to other office buildings so for privacy purposes, curtains need to be drawn. There is a 32” Philips LCD TV and a DVD player. The bathroom has a separate shower cubicle and a good size bathtub which has a weird spoon shape. The hotel claim this is a “designer’s bathtub but I find it difficult to get up from it and it’s quite slippery so use with caution. A pleasant surprise is that this bathroom has strong water pressure, not commonly found in most Shanghai hotels I have tried so far. There’s also abundant toiletries and supply of towels of various size. There is of course the signature Westin Heavenly Bed which while comfortable, I feel it doesn’t really live up to all the hype. Perhaps the heavenly bed can different from one Westin hotel to another. Overall, this is a comfortable room to retire after a long day. Common AreasThere isn’t much to do around the immediate vicinity of the hotel. There isn’t much eating outlets available either right outside the hotel which I find quite odd as usually most streets in Shanghai are populated by various restaurants. Fortunately, the hotel have a good assortment of restaurants including Chinese, Italian and a café which serve buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner though as expected price are on the expensive side. The common areas are generally very beautiful with lighted grand staircase that changes colors during the night. Also an entire front wall of the lobby atrium is decorated with lights and what I think were Christmas decorations. It’a very colorful hotel. I should say that this hotel has a fantastic buffet breakfast. Not only are all the food served very fresh, the selection is huge and include many items not typically found in most hotel buffet breakfast. It’s something I look forward to every morning during my 3 day stay and is only surpassed by the buffet breakfast served at the Intercontinental Hong Kong. So many hotels including even luxury 5-star hotels seems only to serve poor quality or standard buffet breakfast day after day and it's refreshing to find the Westin Shanghai excel in this area. ServiceService is generally fast and efficient if lacking some warmth. This is a business hotel so the fast response is a good thing as when I am on a business trip, I dislike wasting time waiting for anything. I made many request to the hotel staff for a wide variety of task and items since I was meeting my business clients there and everything were arranged very quickly without any fuss. There is even a “Service Express” button on the phone for hotel guest to call on any request promptly. When I said there is lack of warm in the service, it means like the hotel staff rarely smile at all and some of them have that “I’m very busy so don’t try to disturb me look” that makes one hesitate to call upon them. Also, like in the morning when going for the buffet breakfast, I was not once greeted good morning as staff rush around to clean tables and pour coffee. Instead, on every table, there is a “Good Morning” card that actually greet guest good morning in written and remind hotel guests not to hesitate to call on the staff if they need anything. Kind of strange to be greeted this way, not sure if this is the Westin way. I again assumed this is because the majority of Westin Clientele are business travelers. ConclusionThere isn’t much to fault this hotel for. Perhaps the service can be warmer but other than that, I’m hard press to think of any and there’s much to like such as the breakfast and the service response. It’s a business hotel with competitive rates and is a good choice purely for business, and in this aspect, it deliver what is expected. "
the westin bund center ,"Very comfortable After roughing it for 2 weeks; this place was heaven. We had a room with separate lounge for about $350 a night. Nicely decorated, very quiet, free wifi, really good turndown service and room service was excellent. Location was close enough to walk to the Bund and Nanjing road. I particularly liked to huge bath and comfy beds with choice of pillows. "
the westin bund center ,"A Fine Hotel My stay that the Westin Shanghai was from Oct 15th though the 17th, 2008. Overall this is a nice property. I believe it to be overpriced but it is in a good location and has an attentive staff. The workout facility is good but not great, Treadmills slip when running at speed and no staff early in the morning. The executive level offers the standard fare and I enjoyed eggs cooked to order and toast. My only issue really is there are better options for the price point and in fact, better options at less cost. But if your favorite hotel is booked out then the Westin Shanghai is indeed a good choice. "
the westin bund center ,"Nice hotel good location a bit expensive This is my second time in Shanghai and both times I've stayed at the Westin. The hotel is nice, modern beautiful lobby, the rooms are what you expect from a Westin, a bit small but luckily got upgraded to a suite.Location is good, you can walk to the Bund, to the Yu Gardens, to People's square, and a quick taxi to anywhere else.Service is okay, not bad but doesn't feel like a 5 star-hotel service focus where the customer is king. I didn't have any issues but didn't make me feel so special like in other hotels I've stayed before.I will try a different hotel next time I visit Shanghai but would still recommend it to business and pleasure travelers since I had a great stay. "
the westin bund center ,"Great Hotel Location of the hotel was a 5 min walk to the Bund or a 5 min walk to the main shopping area of Shanghai so suffice to say we found this to be perfect. A 10 min walk to and along the Bund took you to the tourist tunnel which can take you across to Pu Dong.We had a deluxe room and it was truly excellent. The room was split into bathroom, bedroom and sitting room which could be made open plan or partitioned with sliding doors. Lovely bath and shower and really well lit.Service at the hotel was very good and nothing was too much trouble for the staff we dealt with. Breakfast was also very good with a wide variety of dishes all freshly made or cooked in front of you.A very pleasant stay! "
the westin bund center ,"Stunning lobby and great service... We stayed in the Westin for the last 2 nights of our trip to China as a treat, having previously stayed in the Jin Jiang hotel.We really enjoyed our stay at the Westin, I really like this chain as it feels like it has a slightly different approach from the rest of the similar chains. Little things like the welcome drinks in the lobby on arrival, excellent facilities in room (incl the complimentary toiletries/accessories), the &quot;Treats&quot; shop and the great buffet selection. Also the Banyan Tree spa although expensive is great if that's what you are into.When you arrive at this hotel you are struck by the huge and stunning lobby which is based around a massive glass atrium with illuminated glass staircases and huge palm trees. Looks great especially in the evening. We got a breakfast-included deal through Expedia but would agree that otherwise the breakfast is a little expensive - but isn't that standard for this class of hotel? It certainly was a wide selection and good to have plenty of local options as well as Western food. The staff were mainly eager to please, I disagree with earlier comments about the reception staff seeming like new recruits - they were charming and keen with us. The only let down were the lobby bar staff where the service was pretty slow even though they weren't busy. Which means the 15% service charge stung a bit.We tried the pool and jacuzzi and for most of the time were the only people in there, which was great. A small gripe: there is no direct access from pool to changing room - a bizarre design fault meaning you have to walk, dripping in a towel or robe, back down a corridor past the gym to get showered and changed. But hardly a massive hardship - just puzzling.All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel although at 110GBP per night incl breakfast it was not cheap. "
the westin bund center ,"Typical business hotel The Westin is a typical fare expensive business hotel, you know what you are getting before you arrive. There are two sides to the building however, the new part and the old part, I have stayed in both and definitively the new part is better. This time I stayed in the old rooms and was quite disappointed, the room was small and pokey, a bit worn, it had the old style tube TV. The water in the bath is brown, the in-room internet is terribly slow its like going back 10 years (both the free wifi and the paid for so-called broadband), this was really frustrating. Room service is good, its fast and prompt, but the menu is limited, and the food is not worthy of the 5* prices. The staff on the reception were poorly trained, as if they'd just been recruited. I have stayed in many excellent hotels, and the Westin is not one of them. "
the westin bund center ,"Good hotel on the Bund Just completed a 5 day stopover at the Westin Bund Center Shanghai.Hotel is a good 4 star property with attentive staff and some quality amenities including good swimming pool.I ate several meals including providing hospitality in the hotel and would highlight &quot;Prego&quot; which serves quality talian cuisine. I was fortunate to receive a complimentary upgrade to executive club room on the 18 floor which was in very good order and very well serviced by the staff. My usual gripe about hotels providing a &quot;value for money&quot; experience applies at the Westin unfortunately. The credit crunch will catch up with these establishments eventually. There were also several comments in local Shanghai papers regarding low occupancy rates at hotels. With EXPO 2010 in the offing, I think Shanghai hoteliers, including the Westin ,should review their room rates to encourage visitors.And I hate the standard practice of adding 15% service charges to all bills. I understand from speaking to Chinese colleague that the service charge is in fact not for &quot;service&quot; i.e. the tip, but instead covers VAT and local sales tax. However, I think that all hotels and other retail outlets in China should just state their prices inclusive of VAT etc rather than sneaking on the tab post sale. Probably need some kind of legislative change no doubt.All in all a good hotel and well located with easy walking for sight seeing and business premises Allow plenty of time if going from one place to another on the Bund at present as the whole area has many roadworks and the area is very congested during business hours. Another word of advice is to make sure you are well buckled up when taking taxis as some of the driving has to be seen to be believed, real white knuckle stuff... "
the westin bund center ,"My home from home I travel to Shanghai regularly on business and typically spend 100 room nights a year in Shanghai. I've sampled several hotels in the downtown area but much prefer the Westin. The rooms are very generous, quiet, and the beds are very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and efficient. Superb leisure facilities and in house Banyan Tree Spa is excellent although expensive. Wide selection of inhouse restaurants are fairly expensive and quality can be so-so. Prego, the Italian restaurant, is my favourite. However, there are many excellent restaurants in the area to suit all tastes/budgets.Good selection of TV channels although a couple of the movie channels often give poor quality reception. For business users, the business centre is well equipped although wireless access is very slow (wire connection is better but attracts a daily fee). There aren't enough lifts so during busy times it can take a while to get to the ground floor.The executive lounge is very comfortable and a nice place to spend an hour at the end of the working day. "
the westin bund center ,"Very Nice I've had 3 stays at the Westin Shanghai over the past 3 weeks. My first visits to Shanghai. The only reason I'm not giving the top rating is that - for the same rate - the room size can vary tremendously. My first room was good sized... certainly no complaints. The 2nd one - and granted that stay was one night only - was tiny... very tiny... and the 3rd room was MASSIVE! I'm not sure how this happened because I wasn't upgraded and paid the same rate each time. Check in was slow the first time, but the 2nd and 3rd time, someone met me as I walked in the front door and escorted me directly to an available receptionist. Very swift.Rooms were well appointed, extremely comfortable, a/c worked fine, and the bathrooms were quite large with separate bath and shower. Breakfast in the main coffee shop on the main level is average - and VERY crowded. Some food and plates/bowls were not replenished very quickly either.Breakfast in the Executive lounge was the opposite... peaceful, quiet, uncrowded, and with great selection.Room service was good quality.Evening options in the executive lounge were plentiful and the atmosphere relaxing. The gym is excellent and large. Complete Cybex weight machines plus free weights and dumbells plus a cardio gym with about 6 Precor ellipticals (newer ones), about 10 treadmills as well as a stairmaster and numerous recumbant and standard bikes. All in good shape and with a TV for each. The gym is also open flexible hours. Rooms in the main tower had wireless internet (free) but it was very unreliable. Wired connection was chargeable. Rooms in the 2nd tower had only wired connection for a fee.My only other complaint besides the size of the one room is that the TV was very erratic. It would frequently black out, and on the last day of my stay it did so and it never recovered. Check out was pretty quick and the staff at reception were OK but not very friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place - especially if you need a good gym and typically book executive rooms. As for me, I'm going to try the Shangri-La next time just for something different. "
the westin bund center ,"Great Place for Business Travel Stayed at this hotel for three weeks in May/June. Very convenient location if you will be working in the downtown area near Xintiandi (10 minute cab ride even during rush hour). While I can't say the Bund did a lot for me, it was convenient being within walking distance of Nanjing Road for shopping. The hotel has several restaurants, all of which were very good. Breakfast buffet is exceptional, with a selction of both western and Asian foods, but expensive at about $30/person given current exchange rates. Did not do the big Sunday brunch, but did do the lower key Dim Sum brunch upstairs which was excellent. Rooms are good sized, logically laid out, and well appointed. The fitness center is very good - lots of cardio equipment and a separate machine/free weights room. The Banyan Tree spa is to die for. Fantastic massages, but a bit pricey by local standards. "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent Hotel Great Hotel. Wonderful Staff. The rooms are luxurious. Good bathroom products, flat screen television, subtle but lovely decor and furniture.3 good restaurants. Expensive compared to local restaurants, but very nice.Hotel Reception/Bar is interesting, but beautiful.Very near to all sights.Would highly reccommend. "
the westin bund center ,"Beautiful property and good location This was the last stop on our 2-week independent tour of China. The hotel is a very attractive property and we were upgraded, based on Starwood gold status, to a junior suite in the Grand Tower, even though we were using points. We also obtained executive lounge privileges by using an additional 2,750 points per night for 3 nights. This was well worth it since breakfast in the hotel restaurant was quite expensive. We had a beautiful room and spacious, modern bathroom. The check-in was not particularly friendly and I found that the English skills of the Service Express staff were somewhat lacking. We checked out in the executive lounge and I discovered that I had left my ATM card in the machine in the hotel lobby the night before. The staff could not have been more helpful, including placing a call to the US for me to contact my bank (at no cost to me) and following up with me by email after we departed. The card was not found but I suffered no loss. The hotel is a short walk from the Bund and therefore has a prized location. I would recommend this hotel not only for its location and well-appointed rooms but also the dedicated and responsive staff in the executive lounge. There is also an attractive pool but I never had time to use it. If anyone is interested, we took a very worthwhile walking tour led by Dvir Bar-Gal, an Israeli journalist, on the history of Jews in Shanghai [-] "
the westin bund center ,"Good business hotel stayed here for a weekend - good business hotel in decent location close to the Bund - check in was fine - nearly all staff had passable English - room was nice, good size and very clean with big walk in shower and stand alone tub - food was ok - had the lunch buffet and then breakfast to the room - both ok for western food in a chinese city - made the most of the hotel car; taxi's are a complete nightmare so its worth every cent to have the hotel car instead of getting lost,ripped off, robbed etc - overall good standard hotel for good standard rate "
the westin bund center ,"The Best Yet We checked in to the Shanghai Westin and it was as impressive as the Westin Hotel in Beijing. The sitting room/office, bath and bedroom were elegant and comfortable. We took a quick inventory of the amenities and discovered more toiletries than usually offered in a hotel. Slippers and robes, and an umbrella were also available.We had free time before dinner and since the hotel is centrally located on the Bund, a group of us decided to walk down to Nanjing Road, the pedestrian zone. Here you find many of the famous stores like Peloman, Hensen's Suit, Peng Street, Hongxiang Ladies Apparel, Mankton, Renli Fashion, Long and Feng Traditional Chinese Clothes, Heming, Lan Tang, Bobu Leather Shoes, Shengxifu's caps and Zhangxiaoquan' s Cissors. We walked past the department stores and restaurants. We wanted to get the flavor of the district. We were just rubbernecking... and fending off the vendors who wanted to sell you flashing wheels to clip on your shoes and glide along the street. At my age I am out of the gliding business.Dinner was quite cosmopolitan. We had western and oriental choices and the International fare for the evening was South African. A nice change, a nice choice. "
the westin bund center ,"Fabulous My partner and I spent only 4 days in Shanghai at the Westin Bund Center, Shanghai. What a fabulous experience!!!The staff could not do enough to make our trip enjoyable. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms - absolutely pure indulgence. Spacious, well appointed rooms. Clean, quite and a great view of the Huangpu River and the Pearl Tower. We used the Banyan Tree Spa for a relaxing pampering. I dont think the staff were quite ready to deal with a European Male - but with much giggling and the always present smile I was treated well.Everything you read on the Westin website is genuine and what IS offered!!. Outstanding spacious rooms, fabulous food, wonderful staff - what more do you want!?!?!?!The location of the hotel makes walking anywhere easy. At reception they have little maps with touristy places marked in Chinese, English and PinYin, so if you need help finding directions just show the map to either taxi drivers or passers by. At each intersection (for those on foot) there are 'pedestrian traffic controllers' - these are the best sources of guidance when walking and they are very helpful.But remember its China! and the locals are a bit reticent about dealing with foreigners, so dont be put off if you approach a passer by and they ignore you - they are not being rude, they just are not as open as the west - (although the same happens in London, Paris &amp; New York).Places which are a MUST to see1. The Green Jade Buddha Temple - get a taxi its only a few dollars). At the Temple they have a vegetarian restaurant and the food is outstanding!! Oh a word of caution, this is a fully functioning Buddhist temple, so do ask permission to take photographs - alto' no one will say anything too you if you dont ask, its just good manners too ask so as not to offend the Buddhist population.2. The Yu Yuan Garden - have a cup of genuine Chinese tea in the Yu Tea House - (but use downstairs - the upstairs is for visitors and is twice the price). But we are only talking about a couple of dollars. Take a day and just stroll around the gardens amazing history and a great experience.3. Walk around and absorb the atmosphere of Shanghai - a city I have fallen in love with. It quite safe to walk down the little side streets and see how the locals live.4. Go to the antique and bricka brack stalls in the 'antique' market.5. If you want authentic local chinese food find a 'supermarket' or grocery and you may find a restaurant upstairs. 6. The Bund is about 5 minutes walk from the Hotel and is also a must to stroll along.7. When queuing to buy tickets just do as the locals do and push and push and push (it helps to have played rugby or other contact sports LOL).I loved Shanghai, I loved the Hotel and cant speak too highly of the place and cant wait to go back!!! "
the westin bund center ,Great rooms great beds great service Stayed here over the Chinese New Year to escape the fireworks in the neighborhood. We had a great stay. Our room was a Crown Deluxe in the new tower. Loved the layout of being able to separate the seating area from the sleeping area. The bed was super comfortable. Maybe the best beds in China. 
the westin bund center ,"CLASSCLASSCLASS Stayed at the Westin on the way through.Within minutes felt guilty that I was there without my family to enjoy.This hotel is A1 and would have no reservations in staying there again.In actual fact simply would'nt consider staying anywhere else.I have tried other hotels in Shanghai, but this hotel is exceptional.The problem was that I needed more time in this hotel but as mentioned I think I'll take my family back later on in the year.The rooms are great,I stayed in a suite in the Grand Tower 10/10.In fact everything was 10/10.The chocolates made downstairs in Treats are great.Carried some very fragile chocolates on a 10 hour flight as if I was carrying nitro just to make sure that they didnt break so I could bring them intact to my family,well one broke the other survived.I have always compared all hotels with the Westin Guangzhou which is my favourite hotel.Well this hotel is great ,I still hold the Westin GZ top of my list basically I think its much smaller lobby makes it a more personnel experience whereas th Westin Shanghai/Bund is a grand scale hotel.However it certainly will leave you very satisfied.The food is exceptional,I found I ate at the Open Lobby Restaurant which was very very good and PREGO was also very good.I still think PREGO at Guangzhou Westin is much better with its food or maybe it might be that open kitchen in front of your eyes.No matter what ,this establishment is of high standard and for some people, that like to go to a place that its good to be seen,well this place might be your comfort zone.I would rather enjoy its CLEANLINESS AND GRANDNESS AND SERVICE.THANK YOU WESTIN SHANGHAI I WILL BE BACK AGAIN. "
the westin bund center ,"Great hotel throughout with one flaw from indifferent staff Stayed two nights for business in Westin Bund. Driver pickup at the airport was flawless even though someone yelled at me for parking the car in front of his. The driver had to calm him down since I had no idea what he was yelling about. Once arrival, was upgraded to a fantastic room at 26th floor with stunning view and amazingly furnished room. Really loved the view of the river from the bath tub. All the amenities were what you would expect from the top notch hotel and staffs constantly showed all the good signs of a well established hotel(friendliness, smile, professionalism...)...except one staff who took care of my check out..will come back to this later.The location is quite tricky since there are lots of construction going on around the area but overall it's not far from any where you wish to go in Shanghai. I had one snack at the restaurant and one room breakfast and couldn't find any faults.The only let down I had from this hotel was from the check out experience; the staff who took care of my check out was very indifferent, voice very small and unforgivingly commanding. An old couple also wanted to check out while I was waiting for the paperwork and without any eye-contact she just told them they can go. Her voice was small so the couple could not hear. When the couple asked her again, she just said &quot;yes you can go&quot;. The old left looking confused. Thought that was very rude and she basically showed same attitude to me.Anyway, in general I had an enjoyable stay with this hotel and would love to come back again for more stays. "
the westin bund center ,"Shanghai First Timer's - Westin O Plenty! The location of this hotel is not that convenient if you are really into nightlife. The place to be is People’s Square, but you would assume what it lacks in location, it would make up in service. I have to say the Westin started out very strong. My girlfriend and I had a Jr. Suite, which was one of the best parts of the trip. Unlike other people that travel, we are ones to enjoy the amenities of a hotel. Heavenly bed, rain forest shower, spoon (soaking) tub, hair dryer (for the ladies), prompt 24hr room service, sofa lounge with a glass desk…all great features of the room and the hotel has all sockets to fit your needs. But, they would change my temperature settings whenever I left the room for the day. Room service was ok, but they ran out of particular dishes as early as 12am! Excuse me, but I thought I was in a hotel. I must agree with most that the Sunday Brunch at “The Stage”, which is within the hotel, is top notch (MAKE RESERVATIONS ASAP, FILLED UP EVERY WEEKEND)! It is noted as the best brunch in Shanghai, but I would say one of the best brunches in the world. Top shelf liquor everywhere (you are greeted on the line with a glass of champagne with a cherry at the bottom), caviar (if your into that), made to order pancakes, sushi, baby lobsters…etc. Lets not forget about the string section, yes live classical music to dine to. The only bad things with the brunch were the dessert and no map of where all the choices in this buffet were located.The spa was not that great, which I would not repeat to be honest. Concierge was pretty helpful throughout the entire trip though. Not knowing any Chinese, they helped as best as they could. Not fluent, better than outside the hotel. They did help us organize a 1 day trip to Beijing (round trip airfare was included) where we had a private tour guide to take us to the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square (Closed because People’s Republic of China’s Congress was in session over the current issues in Tibet) and the Great Wall. A bit expensive, but since I am not sure when will be the next time I am in China, going now is better than never going.The one incident that occurred while we were in Shanghai was late at night we had been coming from the Pearl Tower in Pudong and we jumped into a RED taxi. I was initially hesitant in using this cab since the color was different than most I had seen to this point and the driver didn’t have a seat surrounded by this plexi-glass (you’ll know when you are in Shanghai). But he was right outside the tower and there was another taxi right behind him, indicating to me this must be where the taxi’s congregated. Well once we are inside the cab, he drives a little then informs us that the tunnel had just closed (how can a tunnel with no tolls close at 9pm) and he needed to take us on a longer route. What could be done since we were already in the cab and he already been driving for a few minutes (could have driven us into a bad area for all we knew). Obviously we agreed, but then we noticed the meter was moving so FAST. Usually increasing by 1 RMB every 5 minutes (you can notice that they keep times on the dash separating stoppage time, distance and trip time), this cab had the meter increasing 1RMB every 30 sec. Now we know we are getting hosed, but my concern is getting to the hotel safely. Once we get to the hotel, I figure I would get one of the doormen to help me contest the amount but this one time, there was no one to greet our cab. I go inside to the concierge to get assistance, but the driver drove off. The receipt generated out of the cab was fake and concierge told me that I should have gotten one of them to help because they would not let him leave, but my point was that there was NOONE OUTSIDE. They then inform us that we should not take red colored taxis. Again, excuse me I am in a hotel and I am extremely knowledgeable about Shanghai!At the end of the story, would I stay at the Westin Shanghai Bund Center again…I would, but on my next trip I would try something (Starwood) inside of People’s Square 1st. "
the westin bund center ,"Friendly staff great hotel I stayed here for a business conference. I was very impressed with the property and the staff. The staff were friendly and spoke good English. It was also reasonable walking distance to the Nanjing Dong Lu shopping area. The only downsides were: taxi queue was long at peak times, but the doormen did try to get cabs to come into the property, and the sidewalks around the property were not finished (fully paved) yet. "
the westin bund center ,"Warning Construction Around Hotel We stayed at the Westin Shanghai from February 8-11, 2008. The biggest problem is the construction going on around the hotel. All the sidewalks within a few blocks radius are under repair, so you basically have to walk on dirt. I don't think this major repair will be completed for the next few months, so ask the hotel before you book.The location of the hotel is ok, but be warned that only one side of one tower in the hotel has any views at all. As for it's overall location in the city, it's not that great. Nanjing road and the Bund are a few blocks away, but these are not places that most tourists or business people will be spending more than one hour. In fact it's not within walking distance to any major shopping malls and the immediate area is a run down part of Shanghai.The hotel consists of 2 towers, the crown and the grand. All of the rooms are called jr suites, bc they have a divider and small sitting room. I was a little put off with the front desk bc they basically lied to me and said we have upgraded you to a jr suite, when in fact all the rooms are the same size. The rooms are very nice, especially the bathroom, but bc of the divider it seemed a little cramped. One problem that we faced was that the hotel brunch and dimsum are very popular with locals and we were unable to book a table even a day in advance. There is one ok restaurant near the hotel called the Old Uncle Shanghai Food, but it's located in the basement of the office tower. Overall I would not recommend this hotel for tourists visiting Shanghai. "
the westin bund center ,"Slipping A nice hotel, but certainly not one of the top 100 inthe world as they claim! Stayed three nights and then moved to the St. Regis.I had stayed at the Westin a few times about a year ago and then there was a definite buzz about the hotel...very attentive staff, outstanding food for a hotel, upgrades, big focus on guests. Not this year. Staff in Executive Lounge seemed lackadaisical at best. Food spread was impressive, but just two kinds of wine...a white and a red (undistinguished Shiraz from a screw-top bottle.) Newspaper delivery was haphazard. Amenities not restocked in bathroom. Most unpleasant surprise came the first afternoon. I was taken a jetlag nap at about 5 PM. I had locked the door and turned on the &quot;do not disturb&quot; light, which also deactivated the doorbell. The phone rang. Someone asking me to please open the door so they could return my laundry! I staggered to the door and he handed me my laundry...no apology for waking me up. (It would have been obvious!) No explanation for calling my room when the &quot;do not disturb' sign was on! The rooms at the Westin have never been great. In a junior suite in the new wing, there's almost no place to sit...a hard, armless desk chair and a chaise. That's it! Lots of room...large foyer, big bathroom...but only two uncomfortable places to sit. One of the TV remotes didn't work either. The internet connection was very, very slow.These are minor points and the hotel is still a good one, but if it ever was one of the 100 best in the world, it ain't anymore!St. Regis, on the other hand, seems to improve with age. The Royal Meridien is also preferable to the Westin because of location, cost, and the quality and comfort of the rooms. "
the westin bund center ,Great location good qualty business hotel Stayed for 7 nights in a suite on the executive floor. Overall a very hotel in a very handy location being only two blocks to the bund. Staff generally spoke very good english. Quality of in room dining was average and most of the restaurants were very large hotel standard fair but acceptable. Great pool and spa.The rooms were of a very good size and nicely furnished and very comfortable. Excellent views from some rooms acrosst to Pudong.The club was very pleasant with a good breakfast service and drinks in the afternoon.Had a very enjoyable stay. Recommend having dinner at the whampoa Club. Fabulous. 
the westin bund center ,"de-luxe ! I had a room in the new tower and got a free upgrade to the executive floor. Not that the rooms are any better but I got free breakfast and could have an evening snack in the lounge (actually very good with choice of sandwiches, salad, some small hot items). Room was very luxurious and furnished tastefully (although hard wooden floor would have finished it off better than a carpeted floor). Bathroom very nice and big bath and also rainfall shower. Room was a sort of &quot;mini suite&quot; although wardrobes were near the front door, as far from the bed as you could place them ! Location was good although on the edge of the central area. Not much traffic noise. Gym excellent and on two levels although changing area very small. Breakfast amazing although service a little too efficient (plate taken away when I still had the toast in my hand). "
the westin bund center ,Coming back Walked in an immeditely felt at home. Staff greet you at the door and escort you to the reception. I had a room in the new tower and wow is all I can say. I had a great view of the bund and oriental pearl (when I could see it between the rain snow anfd fog). Walking distance to Bund or E Nanjing Rd. Used the spa and loved it. Room service food was excellent. Definately would stay again. 
the westin bund center ,"Great Comfort We spent 4 nights right after Christmas on a leisure trip to Shanghai. First time to China, and were impressed by Bund Westin. Extremely good value for the price, even if expensive by chinese standards. Staff were helpful and did their best to help us as we didn't speak chinese at all. Concierge was able to book us two trips (one outside Shanghai) and advised us on restaurants and bars.Upon our arrival we were &quot;encouraged&quot; at the reception to upgrade for a junior suite in the new wing. We visited two, and picked up one with an impressive view on the 21st floor. So all in all were happy.Besides the overlooking view, we really enjoyed the luxurious and modern equipment of both room and bathroom.Trying the spa was a wonderful experience : great massages, gorgeous decoration, even though really expensive.We didn't tried neither the restaurants nor the bars, they were too &quot;international&quot;. The breakfast offers an amazing choice and high quality food.Plus the hotel is really close from the Bund, and walking distance from both People's square and Nanjong road. However taxis are always available and don't overcharge, as it happened to us at the Jin Mao tower in Pudong.I can't say more to recommend it. "
the westin bund center ,"Overrated and poor for business I visit Shanghai often on business and decided to try the Westin in the Bund area. Convenient location. Nice restaurant next door called My Shanghai Uncle - traditional chinese menu, reasonable prices, upscale crowd, and english translations on the menu.I am a platinum amex and Gold SPG member and should have gotten an upgrade. They upgraded me to an executive floor room of the same size i was supposed to have on a non-exec floor but didn't allow access to the exec lounge and the included breakfasts. What was he point of the upgrade? The room was clean although I was a bit freaked to find a durex condom in the pocket of the bathrobe. Was this planned as part of the Gates Foundation AIDS prevention program as informed by a colleague or was it a sign that the robe had not been washed? Not sure.The bed was hard with a pillow top that was ineffective. certainly not the &quot;Heavenly Mattress&quot; they advertised and that American Westins have. I complained and was told it was the same as the U.S. mattress. I don't believe they told me the truth. I will check in the U.S.The lobby restaurant is ok. The breakfast was fresh and buffet style. I would like to see more choices and a more reasonable price. The food is only fair.The real kicker with this place is that they claim to be the &quot;best business traveler hotel in asia. They must be kidding. The business center is only open til 11 pm and is poorly accessible except by two escalators not an elevator. When the backlighting on my laptop screen failed, i went to the business center to rent a laptop- the price: 800 rmb ($110) a day! With 6 days left in town I could almost buy a new one for that. I asked where I might get a repair done and they had no idea at the business center. The concierge was helpful but had no idea either. The english skills of the business center folks was also rather marginal. I tried to explain to them that one of the computers in the center had strange signaturing at the top of the browser page that might be a sign of a virus infection or keylogger but got nowhere. I then decided to go to a computer store.The concierge gave me two addresses. The first turned out to be a bank. The second place sold me a cheap monitor ($90) which I attached to my laptop - problem solved. The point of a business center is to solve the business person's problems. I ordered three times from room service. The first time I got a Chinese dish with noodles and shrimp for a reasonable $12. The dish size was adequate but the seafood minimal. The second dish was a filet for $25.00 plus service charge. The meat weighed about 2.5 ounces and was a total of 4 bites. The potatoes were a dollop the diameter of a quarter. There were 5 small pieces of vegetable. I complained to the manager who told me this was the correct portioning. I then ordered a hamburger the same night as i was still hungry. It was ok.Concierge services were average with several folks seemingly just covering and without adequate english skills. I expect english skills when I pick an american hotel that promotes itself to the american business crowd.Pricing was lower on expedia than directly with the hotel and i suspect that's why i didn't get the room or mattress I expected.Overall, I didn't find this hotel worthy of repeat business from myself or any of our staff.Scott R "
the westin bund center ,"Impressive buildings staff could wake up a bit Stayed for just one night early in December, on check-in was shown to a lift that was supposed to take me to my room, but was in fact in the wrong building so ended up wondering around feeling lost (because I was).Went back to reception and eventually ended up in my room, but asked to be changed immediately, it smelt terrible. I had to pay extra to upgrade to the new wing (there are two wings, the new wing that is approx one year old and old wing which is about five years old according to the staff member I asked), this got me a junior suite which was not a suite at all but an average sized hotel room, it smelt OK though.It took over an hour for my bags to be transferred from the old, smelly room to the Junior Suite, and only after much prompting and two trips back to reception.Didn't think the hotel was worth the money, but then I was only there for one night. Previous posters noted construction noise outside the hotel, I was unaware of this on the night I stayed. In my opinion expensive and unimpressive, but I have nothing to compare it to in Shanghai as this was my first visit. "
the westin bund center ,Excellent Great location on the old established side of the river ( NOT Pudong ) close to the Bund and old town. Plentiful and cheap taxis to take you anywhere else anyway.Great service all round on the whole and the glitches that did happen were too minor to mention. Sunday brunch is a classic event with amazing entertainment and food of every type freshly prepared.Rooms are modern with everything you could wish for. Club rooms and lounge even better but even more expensive. In spite of the cost it is still relatively cheap compared with other major cities in other countries. 
the westin bund center ,"Simply excellent Our three nights at this hotel were exceptionally comfortable - spacious room, good food and very helpful service. A quality act. "
the westin bund center ,"Very Pleasant Stay This is a lovely hotel with a great location. It is right in the heart of the city, just blocks from the Bund, but the roads leaving the hotel fast-track you onto the highway system. The rooms are very nice (I stayed in their Grand Tower wing) and they were spacious, pleasant, and with the signature super-comfortable beds. Beautiful design, and the rooms are very new.I just wish their coffee shop was better. I sort of wish these huge hotels in China could have just one local dish on their dinner menu. Perhaps breakfast there, or some of their other restaurants are better, so I don't want to give them short shrift! I would stay there again. "
the westin bund center ,"Very nice I absolutey love Shanghai so am always prepped to have a good time anyway, but the Westin Bund Center helps make my trips to Shanghai something I look forward to. It's still a major business hotel, with all that goes with that - huge cold lobby, a bar in the lobby, group check ins, etc... but the rooms are great; large, clean - great bathrooms with plenty of windows and light. The staff pretty much leave you alone unless you need something, and will do whatever they can to accommodate special requests. If you travel there a few times you will get room upgradeson request...unlike other hotels.Recently there has been some city construction right outside which seems to go on 24 hours a day and really is loud. Other than that this hotel is one of the best business hotels I stay in. "
the westin bund center ,"Very good hotel Very good hotel. Check in fastUnlike the previous hotel i stayed in Beijing (Kerry Center Hotel) the staff can speak English fairly well.Large room. Great bathrooms. Firm bed...some may find it too hard though.Location wise, quiet place and within walking distance to the BundGood breakfast spread... tried mainly the oriental selection which was good. "
the westin bund center ,"One of the best hotels in Shanghai I travel to Shanghai regularly. For the recent trip, I decided to check myself into the Westin Bund. Stayed there for a total of 6 nights. Was given a Grand Deluxe Room (kind of like a mini-suite). The hotel is simply fantastic. Location is excellent - 10 mins walk to the Bund. Hotel is relatively new. Excellent staff - very courteous and always willing to go that extra mile. My package covers breakfast and evening snacks at the fifth floor executive lounge. Excellent food and service there. Westin Bund - certainly my new address is Shanghai!! "
the westin bund center ,"Business hotel It is a large hotel with large lobby, several restaurants, everything a business traveller needs. This is a hotel for just business travellers because it is not cosy with all its cold marble and lights so on a honeymoon or a cosy weekend i would rather stay at Four Seasons in Shanghai or some other alternative. The breakfast was excellent one of the better buffes i have tried, quality was above average but the varieties of food was large, maybe they should have more of different fruites and more darkbread that is healthier. The room was comfortable and large. Seperate area for TV watching but also Tv in bedroom area, good desk for working with all relevant connections. The bathroom was large with a seperate room for the toilet, shower room and a seperate bathtub. The only thing that was not so good was the toiletries, no bathtub salt or anything like that to use when bathing. They did though had a razor, toothbrush male travellers are probably happy for this but the selection for females with only one lotion was not good. You could clearly see that the hotel probably has 80 % men as guests...Location is convenient and taxis are really cheap but do not forget to get a card to give to the driver to get back to hotel... The taxidrivers understanding of english is not so good. I did not try any of the restaurants so i have nothing to say about them. Internet and computer in business center costed me 80 RMB for half an hour. The service of this hotel was good, i got tourist stomac problem when i was in Shanghai and they went to the pharmacy for me and got back with medication and very quickly. The bad food did Not come from the hotel... "
the westin bund center ,"Loved loved loved the Westin Shanghai!! Just returned home from a 4-night stay at the Westin Shanghai (7/18-7/21/07). What an enjoyable stay! Upon arrival, my husband and I were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe Room and whisked away to a separate, tranquil, glass-enclosed area for check-in. The process was a breeze and we went right to our room. I was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly large room and an equally large bathroom - all ultra-modern yet homey. The lighting was so welcoming and soothing, too. Everything was immaculate, organized and non-cluttery. The bed was firm yet comfortable, towels were plentiful, and the shower (both an overhead rain showerhead and a separate hand-held, too) was great, too. We were never bothered whenever we had the Do Not Disturb sign - only a placard was discreetly slipped under our door to let us know that our room could not be serviced due to the Do Not Disturb sign. Which I thought was a great touch - it immediately reminded us to call the front desk for housekeeping when we left our room. We also did laundry during our stay, and it was returned to us so nicely folded and organized in a cute basket!One day, I literally stayed in the room all day to get some work done. I think it says a lot to be able to stay in for so long and feel right at home. The room was full of natural light, the flat-screen TV was awesome and the A/C was never too loud or disruptive. Total heaven!The hotel's location is OK. Not conveniently located in the touristy area (that could be a plus!) but still easy enough (10 min. walk to the metro, and taxis are always plentiful and cheap). Despite it's location, the lobby was always lively and bustling - which I love. I had lunch one day at Le Royal Meridien (which is located on the busy Nanjing Road area, close to shopping and the metro), and the vibe there was definitely different. Very quiet and dead; I much prefer the liveliness of the Westin!Service was good, too. The concierge staff was helpful and always offered assistance with a smile. However, I think the language barrier is always a concern (the Westin staff's English was pretty good, but maybe could have been a bit better). I speak Mandarin, so it was never a problem for us. But I could see some guests getting a little frustrated. During breakfast one morning (the buffet was plentiful and yummy, by the way), a European couple next to us asked the waitress for a napkin. I think she nodded, but didn't really understand the request...so nothing happened. The female patron was visibly annoyed and asked again for the napkin and this time the waitress understood. Now, maybe the patron was having a bad day to begin with, but I just don't think that kind of snotty, pouting behavior was really necessary. They ended up leaving mid-meal and seemed like they didn't even pay the bill! Anyway, it was so ridiculous I had to laugh. Earth to lady: you're in a foreign country! So another plus at the Westin: you can have fun people-watching!!Overall, a fabulous stay and highly recommended. There are just too many other hotels in Shanghai I'd like to try, too but the Westin definitely tops my list of hotels I would visit again in the future. "
the westin bund center ,"Not so great for young Western women Sorry I am writing this review more than one year after my visit.This hotel was immaculate, and I was very happy and comfortable in our corner room. The only thing I should mention is the general vibe I got from the staff at the hotel. I think they are just not accustomed to dealing with hotel guests of my demographic- 25 years old, blonde, American. They just did not seem especially comfortable talking to me or even making eye contact.We did see several &quot;working women&quot; in the hotel bar at night, which does not bother me at all. We even saw one such young lady accompanying a much older Western man upstairs. Again, this is all fine with me. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was whenever I walked alone (without fiance) through the hotel, the staff would look at me inquistively and start speaking into their walkie talkies. This said, I certainly cannot complain about the services. I was travelling with my fiance, who is from Shanghai and speaks fluent Mandarin and English. We both enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much.I would certainly recommend this hotel for business travellers. However, next time we will stay at a different hotel. "
the westin bund center ,"The best place to stay in Shanghai! Perfect location, beautiful rooms, comfortable bed, and flawless services. Can't ask more! Our booked entire China Trip through an agency and they upgraded us to a junior suite. I didn't know the exact rate, but I'd say the experience worths $300.00 a night. The location in Shanghai is very important. Most of the new hotels are in Putong, a fancy commercial area. while Westin is in the historic district with 5 minutes walk to Bund. There are numerous fantastic restaurants nearby and lots of local shops. My wife paid for 120 Yuan (after bargaining) for a great looking dress from a store near Westin, the clerk does not speak any English, and they were shy in negotiating with us. It's quite fun! Later, we found something similar later in temple market, asking for 600 Yuan! It's a great place, the overall stay was more than pleasant! It actually reminds m the W Hotel in New York. "
the westin bund center ,"Five Stars a bit generic The Westin absolutely attains world-class standards for accomodation, service and cuisine. It's a bit bland, in that one could find the same experience in any five star hotel in any city around the world. But the hotel is a lovely respite from the hurly burly of Shanghai. The breakfast buffet is delicious. "
the westin bund center ,"Westin Bund Wow, is all I can say, the hotel is just absolutely beautiful, we got upgraded to a junior suite, closet doors are frosted glass, very modern, the bathroom is all marble with a very deep tub and a separate shower with two showerheads, the bed is very comfortable, contemporary sofa with dark wood writing desk. The hotel is truly an experience. Definitely worth the money. "
the westin bund center ,"Amazing experience Stayed here for 2nights with the family. The hotel is located about 2 blocks from the Bund. This is also a 5star hotel and again you expect a high level of service from the moment you step in. During checkin, there's a complimentary fresh juice station. At this site, we also opted for the suite option. Although, the suite included only 2bed and a rollaway with 1bathroom, it was still very luxurious.The room did come with 2tvs and a desk area. The bathoom had a separate shower (rain-forest style) and tub. Maintenance was very helpful and prompt. My luggage zipper got stuck and in desparation I called the front desk (11pm) whom quickly dispatched an engineer to assist me. Sure enough, the person was able to safely open my luggagewithout damaging my suitcase or the inner contents. Dining at this hotel is also a great experience. The breakfast buffetwas probably the best I had in china (better than the Grand Hyatt in Beijing) b/c it had more selection. Also, the items seemed fresher such as fresh fruit yougurt and custom smoothies. Yes, there is also an omlette and waffle station. A plus here is that all the buffet items have english translations making it more tempting to try some of the asian breakfast options. For dinner, we ate at the pan-asian restaurant called EEST which also was a great experience. The menu is diverse, but the dishes are well made. Dessert was not something to be desired though. After a late acrobat show, we were forced to eat at the generic hotel 24hr dining option, which was a disappointment. I woud have rather eaten at EEST again, but unfortunately it was closed that night for a private wedding reception. Conceirge services are helpful and mean well, if not accurate. I wanted to schedule a trip to Suzhou and was told I could simply purchase train tickets and it would not be a problem. So, I went to the train station and was told that all return tickets to shanghai were sold out due to this being a holiday weekend. The Westin staff should have informed me of this. They did make up for later by setting up the acrobat show (not to be missed). I had heard about several different theaters/troupes offering shows and was confused about which to pick. The concierge said he would look into all of theoptions and get back to us. Sure enough, about 30min later, he came to our room with all the info and differences. We made our choice andhad a wonderful time. The staff speaks excellent english. Overall, this is also a great hotel, worthy of its 5star rating. Breakfast buffet was exceptional and not to be missed. The location is good. "
the westin bund center ,"Grateful traveler This was our first trip to China. Since we elected to travel on our own rather than with a tour group, we decided to stay at a hotel that employed English speaking staff in case we needed to ask for assistance getting around the area. Well, our decision proved wise, not (only) for the reason mentioned above, but because on the second day in Shanghai, I came down with sinus infection that resulted in fever, and needed to seek medical attention. I felt too miserable to get out of the bed, let alone get dressed and look for a medical facility, so my husband went to the front desk to ask if the hotel had a doctor on call. Within minutes, an English speaking doctor was patched through to our room and was asking me about my condition. This happened on a Sunday, at 11:20 am. By noon, the doctor was visiting me in our room, questioning and examining me. He gave me prescriptions of antibiotic, decongestion and a shot of anti-inflammatory/fever reducer to bring down my fever (all out of his little medical bag). By late that afternoon, I felt well enough to walk around, even manage to venture out to Xintiandi for awhile. That evening, the doctor called to check on me – even my own doctor doesn’t do that! The next day was our check out date as we were traveling to Hangzhou by train, something I am certain I would not have been able to do had it not been for the quick response of the hotel staff and the doctor contracted by Westin. We felt we were in very capable hands. So, warm thanks to Mr. Alvin Yuan, the Concierge Team Leader, and to Dr. Alex Liu of CanAm International Medical Center – you saved our trip! And to Westin Shanghai, thank you for providing high caliber services, you rate 5+ stars in our book. Additional comments: the housekeeping service checked every night to see if we needed a turn down service. On the first day, our room was completely made up by the time we came back from breakfast, with fresh towels and toiletry items restocked, and same thing on the second day, only they called to ask when would be a good time to clean, as I had been in the room all day being sick. That evening, when we came back from Xintiandi, the room was clean, and they had even changed the bed linen, something that was much appreciated after being sick, even just for a day. We had the breakfast buffet at the “Stage” on the first morning. The selection was all-encompassing and one of the female maître d' provided personalized service, explaining items from different buffet stations, giving us recommendations, bringing us the “must-try” items herself, essentially ensuring our breakfast was a delightful experience. So, my only regret is that I was not able to maximize on my Westin stay experience because I was sick half of the time I was there. But if one is to get sick away from home, one can “rest easy” with Westin, as they will provide all the comforts of home. "
the westin bund center ,"Good Rooms/Lousy Service Three night stay in the Westin Shanghai from February 25-28. We booked a package rate that included airport transfers and breakfast. Airport transfers were excellent and on time. Hotel is in an excellent location - three blocks from the Bund. Check-in just OK - our &quot;guaranteed&quot; room choices were not available in our bed configuration, but we were happy with the replacement. We had a newly renovated room and our guest had a Crown room. I preferred our room - better layout and seemed roomier. Bathrooms were huge and contained separate shower and tub. Unfortunately, the shower also flooded the bathroom floor easily. There is no door to the bathroom, but a large sliding wall - this proved to be inconvenient. Service in the &quot;Stage One&quot; restaurant was bad - three of us ordered ala carte and one ordered the expensive buffet one night. My brother was being overly generous with his buffet plate, and after he offered some sushi to our Chinese guest, the staff quickly approached our guest to communicate the buffet plate could not be shared. Although we were in error, it was embarrassing that the staff approached our Chinese guest - an all too common discriminatory practice in China. Manager was appropriately apologetic and made amends, but the damage had been done. Then, the next day at breakfast, the same Chinese guest discovered a caterpillar in some steamed vegetable greens - ugh. Next, for some reason, housekeeping skipped the evening service our last night - the one night we happened to need extra towels after the shower flooded. When I contacted the &quot;service express&quot; button to request housekeeping and extra towels, the towels arrived but the housekeeping person refused to take the older dirty towels - annoying. Finally, an American friend employed by Westin emailed a message to our group - the message was never delivered. On a good note, there's a great alternative to the hotel's restaurants - go to the basement of the ajoining Bund Center office building and eat at Shanghai Uncles - better food and much better prices and service. Overall, a mixed bag - the physical facilities, location and lobby staff are excellent, but restaurant and housekeeping staff are not up to snuff. We had lunch at the Le Royal Meridien near the Shanghai Museum - very nice looking and very good restaurant service. If you're wedded to SPG, this looks to be a better option in Shanghai. "
the westin bund center ,"Loved the modern chic! The boyf and I were upgraded to an executive room in their new wing (which used to be serviced apartments). It was great, with a big screen TV in the living room and bedroom as well.The bathroom was a real treat!An additional plus? The &quot;Welcome to Shanghai&quot; brochures and guides, which were especially helpful for a first timer like me! "
the westin bund center ,"Brilliant modern hotel in Puxi Amongst the better hotels in Shanghai, the Westin is a can't-miss choice. Pricier properties (Grand Hyatt, St. Regis) are in the business district of Pudong, while the Westin sits just a few blocks from the storied Bund (easy walking distance). The hotel itself is ultramodern and fantastically comfortable, and makes a great home in this booming city. "
the westin bund center ,"Beautiful Hotel This is a beautiful hotel. Our room was a two room suite with a very large marble bath. We booked through Viking tours, and all of our group had these type of rooms. Everything looked new, may have been redone. It is also in a great location for walking to almost everything. Some of our group were on the other side of the river and had to cab everwhere. The breakfast was also great, with lots of choices. "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent This hotel is fabulous. The staff cannot do enough for you. Our room was beautiful. Clean and airy with beds which we sunk into. Don't leave without trying out a beauty treatment in the Banyan Tree Spa. Heavenly. I could not fault this hotel, it was great and a perfect location. "
the westin bund center ,"Bad place to get sick! Let me up! What a waste of money. Over done. Garrish. Felt like I was on the Titanic. Enough is enough. Opulent to a fault.After eating one of the apples set out in the room, I paid for the snack bigtime.This place is so out of touch with Shanghai, you might as well be on the moon or in Las Vegas. The best thing about this hotel is the woman at the frong desk who are as kind to you on the way in as they are to you on the way out.Never, ever again. What a waste of dough. "
the westin bund center ,Excellent Hotel - Would stay again Spent a week at the Westin in Shanghai and loved every moment of it. Staff were wonderful and service impeccable. Our deluxe room on the 11th floor had direct views of the river with the Bund on one side and Pudong on the other. The light show across the river at Pudong at night was spectacular (shades of Lost in Translation - 80 story buildings with amazing video footage) My favourite was a white dove that started at the bottom on the building and flew to the top. Brilliant service - wonderful room - extra large fluffy white towels and bath robes. Couldn't have asked for more.My grateful thanks to all the staff. Will definately go again when I get the chance.RegardsNardya Colvin (Australia) 
the westin bund center ,"Ok but wait until reno is done My wife and I recently stayed at the Westin Shanghai. I agree with some of the other reviews in that the lobby and main atrium areas are excellent. The rooms are quite out dated though for a Westin. Business center is good for Internet but 40 RMB for 15 minutes is criminal. Internet was expensive all through China Starwood hotels. Get your act in order Starwood!We were upgraded to a suite however the room was still quite small. The beds are probably the worst thing about the room. Quite a shame since they do have Heavenly bed sheets on them. Make sure you can withstand a VERY hard mattress.The executive lounge on the 5th is excellent. I would highly recommend getting access to it. Standard fare for food (for asia, much better than lounges in NA) and free alcoholic drinks.I did speak with the concierge about the hotel. It seems the entire other tower is under renovation and thus closed until October. I have no doubt Westin will fix the room problems. As most of you SPG members are aware, Starwood is finishing off the Royal Le Meridien in the area. It is in a much better location for shopping and siteseeing (right at the corner of Tomorrow Square on Nanjing road(main shopping road). This should be open at the end of Sept. I took a look at the new hotel and it looks stunning. I would definitely stay there next time around. We also stayed at the Four Seasons. This hotel was by the far the best in Shanghai. The location is awesome nearby some fifth avenue types shopping and dining along upper Nanjing road. We had an awesome time there. Beds were amazing as well.Other than that I don't want to dis the Westin b/c it is in a nice area and you can do much worse. "
the westin bund center ,"Tacky mess--Shanghai meets Las Vegas The hotel was clean and the staff was polite and efficient. However, the rooms were tiny and the decor was horrendous--dark wood and mirrors everywhere. This has to be one of the ugliest &quot;high-end&quot; hotels I have ever stayed in. "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent Hotel Stayed for 4 nights as part of touring holiday ( by train) and we appreciated the luxury of the hotel after an overnight sleeper journey. We ate in the hotel each night and were not disappointed by any of the three restaurants - ate twice at 'EEST', very good ! The staff were very attentive. We had hoped to have a river view room, but this proved to be impossible, however we had a corner suite (upgraded at no extra cost) with a view across the Bund to Pudong. We actually loved the changing colour staircase ! so uplifting !We would particularly like to mention Mr. Lawson Sun (reservation manager) with whom we had been in contact by e-mail. and who booked train tickets for our onward journey, saving us a great deal of trouble and time; the tickets were waiting for us on arrival.A most enjoyable stay in this lovely hotel which we would recommend to both business travellers and tourists. "
the westin bund center ,"Stunning Hotel I stayed at The Westin for two nights in the end of April. The Hotels design is just stunning. Despite being in Mainland China the level of english, spoken by the staff is great. From the moment we stepped in the Hotel until we left there was nothing left to be desired.Food was served flawless and with a high level of service. I will defenitely come back. "
the westin bund center ,"Avoid this hotel For the first time we were disappointed and regretted to have, as we did for many years, systematically chosen a Starwood property whenever there is one available at our destination.The Shanghai Westin starts with a very big lie, everything makes believe that the property enjoys a high-rise Bund view, all pictures show a high building with a Westin-crown-like top when in fact the hotel is a different small ugly building hiding behind the one presented, and has no view at all. This is a dishonest unacceptable commercial trick, unworthy of Starwood to say the least.Our &quot;Executive Floor Deluxe&quot; room, with no view to speak of, was a narrow crammed space with a ridiculously small poorly fitted bathroom... And this was meant to be a GPG upgrade !The Executive Club is a poorly designed area, partly gained on a corridor, offering a miserable breakfast and an unhappy miser happy hour, rude and incompetent attendants. The staff there did not even know that Shanghai has a concert hall (world famous !) and gave us wrong information that deprived us from attending a temple festival we were looking forward too. (They said it's finished when it was not, we stupidly believed them and found this out two days later, when it was indeed finished) We never heard a &quot;sorry&quot;.The hotel's overall decoration is a joke of &quot;kitch&quot; with fluorescent colours and ridiculous bad but loud musical performance in the lobby, corridors are so low my husband had to bow his head to walk through, appalling food and very, very bad service at the ground floor restaurant, the other restaurant offers better food but looks like a poor motorway facility...At 450 $/night all in this sad affair is extremely overpriced compared to much better local hotels such as the Four Seasons and the Shangri-la, not to mention the fabulous, excellent Bangkok Royal Orchid Sheraton offering a large, well appointed stunning river view room (and a great Club service) for 1/3 of that price ! The Westin Shanghai is a a rip-off, a scandal, a shame for Starwood.We will certainly never choose a Westin property again and from now on we will think twice, check and ask before blindly and trustfully going for Starwood as we have been doing for over 20 years. "
the westin bund center ,"very disappointing I grew up in Shanghai and have a special attachment to the area around the hotel. I booked for three nights but only managed to stay for one. The hotel was so close to the office buildings around it that one could literally see almost everything in those offices: computers, desks, file folders, etc. By induction, you would be on wide display if you left the curtains open. I checked in at 9pm and had to flee by 11 in the morning. I guess crowded buildings are to be expected in Shanghai. But for the Westin price, one would expect a bit more. Also, the service was polite but indifferent. "
the westin bund center ,"Stunning Shanghai Hotel My husband and I recently spent three most pleasant nights at the Westin Shanghai. We are SPG members and on arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade from an SPG floor room to one of the Executive Levels for an extra US$70 per night. We were so glad we agreed to this as it included a lovely breakfast buffet in the Exec lounge, snacks and beverages all day, and best of all Happy hour from 5.30pm - 7.30pm. We are from Sydney and both enjoy a nice glass of wine. Imagine my horror when reading the wine list in the restaurant on the first night and seeing an Australian wine we pay around $10 for being charged at around $100 per bottle (or $20 glass). Off to the happy hour each night and the upgrade more than paid for itself.The rooms are very comfortable, and the luxury beds are wonderful. Marble bathroom is stunning and very well appointed. We ate one meal at the Lobby restaurant which was very nice, but went out to local restaurants for lunch and dinner for the rest of the time. If you love Peking Duck try and find this restaurant (I could not read the name!!). Come out of the Hotel and turn left Walk straight along and cross the street staying on the left hand side. You will see a building which is an office building, and may notice a restaurant on the second floor. Catch a lift to the 2nd floor and you will find an authentic Chinese restaurant that serves the most amazing Peking Duck (and many other lovely dishes). Four of us feasted for under AUD$60 and the service was most attentive. Cannot quite get used to people smoking in restaurants, but hey, we are not at home!!The Spa at the hotel was most luxurious and they offer a few discounts for hotel guests so it is not as expensive as it initially seems. They will also put a package together to suit your desires. I enjoyed a half hour back massage and a one hour facial, it was heavenly!!Staff are courteous at all times and whilst the lobby is a bit garish there is also something very intruiging and welcoming about the coloured stairs - sort of reminds of the horses that change colours in the Wizard of Oz.Highly recommend this haven in the middle of a very busy city. "
the westin bund center ,"Loved this hotel Loved this hotel! My husband and I visited Shanghai with our two children and this is the only hotel that would guarantee us connecting rooms. Our two suites (each with it's own living room) were beautifully decorated in a contemporary Asian theme. The bedroom portion of the suite was somewhat small, but the overall layout was spacious. The bathroom was great! Beautiful marble, glass and lighting fixtures. Plenty of amenities. The staff was very courteous and helpful with the exception of the concierge. He spoke very little English and did not know anything about the new Circus/Acrobatic show in town. The breakfast buffet was plentiful, and the lunch menu had a good selection of Asian and Western items. Overall it was a great experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
the westin bund center ,"Kooky lights I chose the Westin because it was one of the newer hotels and also because I usually like the Westin decor. The general fitout was kooky to say the least - palm trees (fake? real?), weird lobby layout and really garish stairs that lit up in different neon colours.The rooms was fine, although the water was disgusting - it stunk of mud and dirt. The first night I tried to have a shower, the bathroom flooded and water was everywhere.Beds were great, as usual. For a 5 star hotel, I expect more, particularly more subtlety. "
the westin bund center ,"Surprise in Shanghai Spent a weekend back on Nov 2005 in Westin Hotel - Shanghai. Out of my surprise this 5-star Starwood's hotel is just right next to the Bund where all those designer shopping mall and brand new western restaurant is just 5mins walk from the hotel, so convenient! When you get bored with the other 5-star hotel in Shanghai, try Westin! "
the westin bund center ,"Best Hotel in Shanghai My husband and I went to Shanghai over Christmas/New Years this year for 10 days.Because we were going to be there for a reasonable amount of time, we decided to stay at a few different hotels.The Grand Hyatt had the view, the Portman Ritz Carlton was the most elegant, and the Radisson New World had the friendliest staff and best location, but the Westin was by far the best all-around.The lobby is very modern and interesting, with lighting which changes colours in the stairs, and most of the restaurants are at the back of the first several levels so that you can enjoy overlooking the lobby.We only ate there twice, both at the buffet restaurant, once for breakfast and once for the &quot;hairy crab&quot; dinner buffet. Both were very good but priced as such, with a very wide variety of quality selections.Our room was a corner junior suite, with a beautiful, deep bathtub with a window overlooking the lights of the bund which was beautiful at night, and a separate glass shower. I very much liked the bathroom.Fresh fruit and bottled water were provided daily.The room amenities were good, the bed was comfortable, and there was a good selection of TV stations.The staff were pretty friendly and the concierge and parking attendants very helpful.Our trip to the pool was interesting. My husband said that the hot tub in the boys locker room was very new and modern, while my experience with the girls' locker room was the opposite... the hot tub bubbler was broken, the hot tub was old, with murkey water, and it seriously needed updating.The location of the Westin was very good... a few blocks from the Bund, and just off Nanjing Road, which leads to all the good shopping.It was a bit more out of the way than the Sofitel or Radisson, but the quality of the hotel much higher.I would make this my hotel of choice for my next visit to Shanghai, most definitely! "
the westin bund center ,"Not worth the price I thought that the hotel was average, slightly overpriced for what was offered. We were there for New Years and decided to stay at the hotel for the party, the buffet was excellent but for 4 days the total bill was very high compared to what services we had. We did explore around and other hotels in that price range seemed to have more to offer. I probably wont stay there again. "
the westin bund center ,"Excellent Experience I stayed at an upper floor and the room had a great view toward the Bund direction. The bathroom, its spectacular view and its rain-fall shower were very impressive. The room was nicely decorated and the ambiance was refine. It had a separate living area but it was on the smaller side. Then again, this is the city of Shanghai.In my opinion, this hotel came across as a hotel for business travelers with a more polite functional style of services as compared to the attentiveness of other five-star hotels in Asia. I actually found the location of this hotel not as convenient unless you have business nearby or you wish to be able to walk to the Bund. The massage at the SPA was fine but I think it was overpriced for what it has to offer.Overall wise, it was an excellent experience for its room and the service was commendable. I'd consider this hotel again for my next visit. "
the westin bund center ,"Service and stay at the Westin was divine! Just returned from a three night stay at the Westin in Shanghai.Was bowled over by the fantastic service of the staff.Everyone , from the porter, the concierge , the receptionist took pains to make our stay truly a home away from home. Beds in the guestroom were comfatable, and the toilet was extremely clean. Ambiance at the hotel was bright , cheery and modern. Avoid this hotel if you like old-style decor and ambiance. There's a very good gym and spa on the third floor of the hotel. We chose to stay at this hotel largely because of its location-- its right on the bund , just a five minute walk from celebrated restaurants like the Whampoa Club and Jean Georges ( which are in a building called No 3 on the Bund ) and a five block walk from Nanjing Road , which is a major shopping street in Shanghai.One major note of caution for first-time visitors to Shanghai-- do not assume that just because Shanghai is a major business city, that the general standard of English spoken and understood by the populace is high.Most of the Shanghainese thatI met do not speak English at all, or very minimally.I understand that in Beijing, which is the capital, English is much more widely spoken and understood. So if you are not Mandarin speaking , try to bring a friend who is conversant in the language,especially when trying to take a cab.The taxi-drivers whom I met didn't understand an iota of English at all! "
the westin bund center ,"very good hotel but still needs some improvment We stayed in westin for 6 days in Oct. Nice room, very nice bathroom. The staffs are good, but are so so if you are not business travelers. There are a lot of Chinese women &quot;hanging around&quot; in the bar and &quot;looking for foreign friends&quot;, The hotel does not really borther at all, because hotel makes money when the guy buys drinks, etc for the girls. I just hope this is a bit discreet although I do realize people have to make a living somehow. We are from Washington, DC. The five start hotels will never let this happen in the lobby and bar over here. Overall, nice hotel for business travelers, and not so friendly to young people. "
the westin bund center ,"almost perfect We had a 3-night stay at the Westin and it was great. The price was high compared to other hotels in the vincinity, but it is a class on its own.We had a buffet dinner and that was average. We didn't visit any of the other restaurants.In the afternoon we ordered in-room lasagna, but that was a great dissappointment. Every Italian would scream for the sacrilege of this classic dish. There were noodles and prawns in it, in stead of pasta and grounded meat. The Westin didn't charge this meal for we returned it untouched.Apart from the lasagna-dissaster we had a fun time in all the luxury we could wish for. It felt like coming home after a stroll through the city. The location was also ideal, direct next to the Bund. Enough reasons to classify the hotel as excellent! "
the westin bund center ,"Its good We stayed in a two bedroomed suite. It was good value, modern compared to other hotels. Wonderful restaurants in nice settings. It does have big groups staying so you need to book ahead. "
the westin bund center ,"We got upgraded We arrived at 2PM on Wed. but were told that they did not have a king sized bed for my wife and me. To compensate us as Starwood members, they gave us an upgraded room on the 15th floor, complete with a separate sitting area, 2 TVs, a desk with FAX, and a deluxe large marbeled bathroom. Everything was in working order after we figured out the complex lighting system. The staff was friendly, but their English was spotty - some passable while others were minimal. It seems that English speaking skills found in hotel staffs in mainland China remain a weakness... in comparison to other tourist cities and especially Hong Kong. "
the westin bund center ,"A very lovely hotel however This is a beautiful, immaculate, ultramodern hotel, however our room had very little storage/closet space. The bathroom was gorgeous, but no counter space and very poor lighting. The one outlet in the bathroom is for &quot;shavers only&quot;, making it almost impossible to use the blow dryer provided. The room appears well suited for male business travelers, and ill-suited for females who want to put on make up and blow dry their hair!The spa is outstanding. Service throughout the hotel is outstanding. "
the westin bund center ,"Great Hotel Hi,I have been on the road a lot lately and one thing I must say is key for a great hotel stay is a _great_ spa in the hotel... Yes, the Westin has a great spa... Check it out when you go.Now to the standard chat... Rooms: The rooms are very nice, see pictures... The location is very good, in the middle of a lot of action. Service: The service is friendly and quick. If you forget to plan ahead and book reservations for dinner at that super hot place - not a problem, just go by the Concierge's desk and they will get you in. Food: The hotel has several restaurants, you can go to a casual place, buffet style downstairs - great brunch, all the way to a fancy sit down dinner type place. Tours: Also if you are only in town for 1-2 days, they can set you up for a 1 day tour with a private guide and car. Not too expensinve and a quick way to get around town. Why not Excellent? Well, I tend to mark &quot;Excellent&quot; for above and beyond service with unparallel experience. This hotel is great, I will be back, don't get me wrong. However, very few hotels will get &quot;Excellent&quot; in my book. The 2 most important questions:Would I got back? Yes.Would you recommend this hotel to your best friend? Yes.Happy Travels! "
the westin bund center ,The Westin Shanghai is Fantastic! I just got back from 2 different stays at the Westin and both were very nice. The Westin is located in a great area of Shanghai very close to The Bund. You must take a stroll down to the Bund it has a very European feel at night on one side and the other side is very China with the big buildings that light up and the Pearl TV Tower. I first had room 1811 which was great with a nice city view this was a corner room and was very quiet. The second room was 1111 and had the exact same layout just down a few floors. I would stay here again in a heart beat. The Health club was top notch and the Spa looked like every girls dream. 
the westin bund center ,"The Westin Shanghai Surprise While the Grand Hyatt across the river can boast of being the tallest in the world, there's still something to be said about staying in a hotel that's a crowning presence along Shanghai's historic Bund. No, the hotel isn't on the avenue per se, its a 5-minute walk away; and yet it's presence is a landmark sight, lighting up the nightscape for tourists to ogle at every evening. As for the service, yes, the Westin lives up to all the hype...cool, crisp, almost cold attendance from everyone. The room I got was a corner deluxe with a magnificent view of the river, thanks, I presume to an earlier request made via e-mail. Kudos to the reservations officer. The breakfast buffet was rather run of the mill--certainly not to be confused with the weekend brunch which is over the top if you're in the mood for excesses. Be especially wary of language barriers and miscommunication when dealing with the Concierge. When I asked for a taxicab to the Armani store, I was brought on a 40-minute taxi horror ride to an Armani Bar across town. Not the fault of the taxi really--the concierge assumed this was where I wanted to go and wrote it down for the driver. All this in the middle of the afternoon....talk about being Shanghai'd! Will I stay there again? Truth be told, I've gotten mighty curious about the tallest one across the river. But for sheer proximity to the charms of Shanghai--the Westin deserves its mighty crown. PS: I think the Heavenly beds are over-hyped...they're nice--but really, to call them heavenly reeks to much of the marketing arm. "

urbn hotel ,"Great accomodation let down by a terrible restaurant We loved our room at URBN, the design and style was amazing and the hotel staff were attentive. The location is great. The restaurant was disappointing though, and really detracted from our experience. The food was oily and uncreative, one dish was so oily i physically felt ill and didn't finish it. The manager of the restaurant was also quite rude, which really was a shame given how much we enjoyed the other aspects of the hotel. I would stay there again...but will be going out to eat! "
urbn hotel ,"a novelty but away from the centre Imaginatively finished with recycled materials in keeping with its status as a carbon neutral hotel, clean and comfortable with a decent restaurant. The local area is fairly anonymous although its only a 10 minute walk to reach a couple of shopping malls and the local metro station. "
urbn hotel ,"5* Eco Hotel In Downtown Shanghai This hotel is the most Eco friendly hotel in Asia. It is carbon neutral. Its restaurant is superb. The staff are attentive, the public areas are all made from reclaimed wood and stone. Truly truly an example to the global hotel industry. This hotel offers splendid value for money and I must echo the previous post. If you are exhausted after your travel to Shanghai or just need to unwind after a hard day at work....Make a point of visiting Sugar &amp; Spice Massage next door. The service and quality is exceptional and half the price of the hotel service. "
urbn hotel ,"Full of nice surprises started from stepping thru the hidden entrance Stay for at least 2 nights and book E_A_R_L_Yas you need :- an hour to check the characteristic decoration and the art pieces,- another hour stay in the bath by the bed, enjoy watching the DVD and a glass of organic wine at the same time, - 2 hours in the resturant for the dinner prepared by the Australian chefs, yummy !- a morning in the gardern for a nice brunch under the sun "
urbn hotel ,"A quiet hotel with well-designed concept and details in the center of a crazy city! The overall stay is memorable. I love the room design, the outdoor restaurant and all those green ideas. My friends love the inroom lounge sofa!I guess maybe due to the green concept, the hotel has no parking space at all. I arrived Shanghai by own car and had to find a parking place by myself in the midnight. Not very pleasant experience because I even had to take a taxi back to hotel from the parking venue (a car wash station) due to luggages. "
urbn hotel ,"my favourite hotel in shanghai This was the second time I have been there and I love it. I stayed in a garden view room both times. Absolute best bit is that internet is free and they explain how to access it as soon as you step through the door. The hotel smells wonderful and feels like home right away. If I could afford to live there i would and it wouldn't be hard as there is a lot of storage space. All the things that boutique hotels often mess up (patchy service, weird/impractical design etc) are equivelant to any other 5* branded hotel but more personal and genuine.Only downside is that breakfast was not included and is pricey compared to the other options near by - looked good though. Also all the stairs in the rooms would provide a pretty major barrier to the physically impaired. "
urbn hotel ,"The most relaxing hotel haven in Shanghai...highly recommended! For the business traveler or tourist in this busy town, this hotel will ensure that your stay is relaxing and pampered. Urbn is discreetly tucked away within a garden enclosure of white stones and bamboo, a zen view from your window. The hotel staff are young, friendly and efficient with good language skills. The rooms are simple, elegant and well designed with sunken lounges and open bath. The large showers are very luxurious with slate tiles and abundant room for two. The textures and qualities of the decor are from re used wood giving the hotel a special quality that is a mix between modernism and nostalgia. This is a great boutique hotel for an intimate and relaxing stay in such a fast paced, hectic &amp; brilliant city that is Shanghai. "
urbn hotel ,"Nice modern design hotel with eco focus Great design, great service. Internet is very nice. Gym is very nice but not on site. Restaurant is good, room service menu is light on items. "
urbn hotel ,"From garden to bedroom the relaxing atmosphere brings inspiration. URBN was very cool. I had a lot of hopes after seeing the website, and from check-in to check-out, the experience was even better than expected. The free upgrade was definitely a nice bonus, but I'm guessing the stay would have been wonderful even without it.The artistic but homey design definitely was a great passive relaxant. "
urbn hotel ,"Most friendly and best services I have been visiting the hotel a couple of time with friends, and I must say we were always very happy and impress with the services each time we were there. The hotel has a very convenient location but yet feel very secluded. Once you step into the main entrance, you feel calm and soothing which is very unusual to find in Shanghai city center. When we arrived, the staff were very friendly. We had our birthday party in their Green Room Bar. This bar is big enough to hold about 30-50 people with a very intimate feeling. The two bartainders provided excellent services. They heard no one brought a cake, they immediately offered to go pick one up from a near by bakery for the party. On top of that, they made some great cocktails and shots.... All our guests enjoyed the hotel and the services a lot. Many were impressed and said they will comeback again. Forgot to mention, their downstair restaurant provides delicious dishes and good selection of wines. The staffs were all very attentive as well. "
urbn hotel ,"Staycation I live in Shanghai and my boyfriend and I decided to have a &quot;staycation&quot; in the city to relax without having to travel. We chose this hotel because it is quiet, yet in a convenient and busy area of the city. The experience was awesome! The design is beautiful and tranquil, it is nice to see sustainable design and greenery in the middle of the city. The showers are awesome and the bathtubs are huge. The king size beds were so soft that we slept for 13 glorious and uninterupted hours.The best thing was the service. We didn't have to ask for anything because it was already there (yoga mats in each room), or the staff anticipated our needs and would bring things before we had to ask. But they did this in an unobtrusive manner. The owners of the hotel were actually working in the hotel and they introduced themselves and took care of a lot of things as well. We felt like guests in their home. We were going to go to a fancy restaurant for dinner but decided to stay in our rooms and order room service. Instead of providing us with the normal room service menu, the owners arranged for us to order off the menu from the hotel's gourmet restaurant downstairs and had it delivered to our room. It was probably the best food I have had in Shanghai, and I have been to almost all of the upscale restaurants in Shanghai.It was such a fun and good experience that we are going to stay at URBN again in a couple of months just for the heck of it. One of the owners sat and had a drink with us at the bar and told us they are going to be opening up another location in the city soon. We might try that one next! I just hope that the new location has a spa, which was the only thing that was missing from URBN. "
urbn hotel ,"Cool hotel with smaller handicaps Flood after each shower, only 5 TV channels, a little bit complicate to move across the room, room a little bit dark "
urbn hotel ,"great boutique hotel with garden which is very unusual in shanghai very nice design hotel with great, friendly people and beautifull rooms. if you stay for business, use the greenroom for your business meetings or if you have to work in the hotel. Service is great and interior is more then great! "
urbn hotel ,What a fantastic experience....I LOVED IT!!! This hotel is a GEM!! What a relief to finally find a hotel that is forward thinking yet mainstream when it comes to luxury service. The best of both worlds as far as I am concerned. The fact that you have a unique experience and have 5-star service if an experience that I will return to time and time again! The restaurant is fantastic...both food and service. The staff delightful and the attention to detail is as if you were at Four Seasons. Stay here...you'll love it! 
urbn hotel ,"Second time round - twice the pleasure This was my second stay at URBN Hotel in Shanghai and once again I enjoyed every minute of my experience! From the moment I got pick up from the airport by the hotel's luxury Audi A6 to the immediate recognition I recieved from the staff upon entry (even though I had only stayed once before), I felt right at home. The staff were very attentive and courteous throughout both my stays (the complete opposite to some of the other tripadvisor reports I have read). The room was extremely comfortable with a great bathroom and free internet. This hotel offers all the mod cons you come to expect, at a very affordable price, with the knowledge that you are also supporting the first &quot;green&quot; hotel in China - I will never stay anywhere else!! "
urbn hotel ,"Great affordable hotel in Shanghai A really funky boutique hotel, that was very reasonably priced and had great room and staff. "
urbn hotel ,Great stay Had a great stay in Shanghai at the URBN property. Room was very cool with bathtub near the bed and a nice area to lounge. The downtstairs is really pretty and enjoyable for a drink. Service staff is helpful and accomodating. 
urbn hotel ,"From the design to the comfort and service...5 star Shanghai was the first and last port of call on our 2 week trip to China...we arrived exhausted to a private airport pick up from the URBN hotel and were very relieved when we made it to the hotel. it is a haven for weary travellers! The staff were efficient from start to finish...although some spoke English better than others they gladly met all our requests (even arranging the booking of all of our internal flights...albeit with a little confusion and delay...a notebook for the change of shift would be welcome addition to the hotel!) The rooms were spacious and tranquil...the bed was enormous and super comfortable! The bathroom in room 13 did have a tendency to become a little flooded after using the shower as the drainage wasn't at its best but i cant say that it really bothered us that much! the bathtub was so large you need to allow for a good 20 minutes to fill it! We also stayed in room 12 which was with the garden view...also a fantastic room. well designed and well appointed to match with the rest of the hotels features...the restaurant was great (we didn't eat there in the evening but had drinks etc) and breakfast was one of the best that we had in China...living in Italy we have very high expectations for coffee and the cappuccino was fantastic....! After midnight the restaurant is all shut down and the hotel is very quiet...could be a positive or a negative!The location was great, it was away from what felt to be the crazyness of the Bund etc but walking distance to the French Concession and a short taxi ride from any other area of the city.I would also strongly recommend a foot or chinese massage at the Sugar and Spice Massage Parlour next to the hotel (come out of the hotel and turn left, 2-3 doors down). it was around £10-£15 for an hour and the girls were fantastic...open until 2am so it was great for anyone suffering from jet lag "
urbn hotel ,"Restaurant the worst manager EVER. The restaurant was totally empty on a Friday night. The Chinese staffs were quite nice and helpfulThe manager (Maybe French, not sure) was SO rude and I just can’t believe the way he spoke to us… The food wasn’t all that great for its price but the Expat manager’s attitude totally ruined my night. I will NEVER EVER go back to this restaurant again. No wonder there was no other customers in the restaurant! "
urbn hotel ,"Perfect first trip to Shanghai! Urbn Hotel was hands down the best introduction to Shanghai! We arranged a private hotel pick up for the airport. We where greeted by English speaking hotel employees and helped up to our room. Urbn is the first carbon neutral hotel in Asia which was a huge reason we wanted to check it out. It has gotten tons of amazing press, but sticks true to its &quot;boutique hotel&quot; feel. With inly about 20 rooms it stays quiet yet fun!The rooms where very comfortable! free wi-fi was a huge plus! Free fruit and water in the rooms. Bathroom had a huge shower and plunge bath tub! The gym was full of the most up to date equipment. The location is on a quieter side street which is a huge plus in a bustling city like Shanghai! It is easy to grab a taxi outside and the hotel stays quiet! All materials used to build the hotel are local or recycled. Also they use all the most energy efficient technology so the hotel does not waste energy. The whole staff was extremely helpful, even arranging and booking flights for us to Beijing and charging them to the room. They wrote everything down in Chinese for us before we would venture out for the day. This made things so much easier to just show the taxi driver where we wanted to go, since really no taxi drivers speak English. I would recommend this hotel to people of all ages! It truly was a fabulous experience and when we go back to Shanghai we will def stay there again! "
urbn hotel ,"Wonderful Courtyard We stayed two nights at URBN and truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel has a beautiful design and nice spacious rooms. In particular the courtyard is a gem. After a day of walking Shanghais crowded streets it was an enchanting experience to sit quietly in the lush courtyard beneath the shadow of large trees and enjoy a cool beverage. You would never imagine that you were in the center of one of the world’s busiest metropolis. We also stayed two nights at Jia, and very much enjoyed our stay at both hotels. If we are to return to Shanghai we would probably spend all nights at URBN due primarily to the courtyard. The service at Jia was, however, better and whereas URBN added many extra expenses to the final bill everything (including evening wine) was included in the daily rate at Jia. "
urbn hotel ,"Comfortable elegant styling (and wickedly good coffee) This Hotel is an oasis tucked away on a busy back street in Shanghai. As soon as you step into the grounds the noise stops and serenity surrounds you. The rooms are comfortable and roomy - the bed is low to the ground but heavenly. The bath is big enough for two and the bath product - lovely. The TV is large and swivels to insure you can always view it. The restaurant attached makes (which is very rare in Shanghai) excellent EXCELLLENT coffee and great meals - I am still dreaming about the Ceaser Salad! I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to other 'trippers' with style and who respect simple, effective design and are enviromental and consciously caring about carbon counting! "
urbn hotel ,"Fabulous service in your own designer home We first booked another hotel which turned out to be below our expectations upon checkin. Out of desperation, we checked with some friends who had been living in Shanghai and they recommended URBN where their business associates had been staying. We called URBN immediately and they were extremely helpful and polite. Upon arrival, we were made to feel comfortable and were shown 2 different rooms before we made our decision. We chose room 10 on the 3rd floor, with a gorgeous window view of the tall trees.The overall experience was wonderful - staff was friendly, ever helpful, and requests were all attended to within a short time. Even room service for dinner was served within 20 minutes. It was easy to catch a cab from the hotel entrance to other areas. The reception could even print out the exact directions to be shown or communicated to the cab driver, in mandarin.The only grouse was the unexpected lunch experience at the restaurant on the day of our departure. We waited 30 minutes before our order was served and it was not what I ordered. Instead of mussels with fettucine, I was served prawns and the managed only returned to clarify that they ran out of prawns when my husband and I looked surprised at the food. The remaining dishes were bland. It was as if a different chef had prepared food this time round. We concluded the chef had fallen ill. Anyhow, we highly recommend this hotel to anyone who loves modern design and fabulous service. "
urbn hotel ,"Absolutely Great in all aspects Amazing hotel!I've travelled to China many times and it was the second time I stayed in a boutique hotel in China. My boyfriend and I stayed at the URBN for 3 nights in February. We decided to try the URBN because it was awarded best hotel in the Conde Nast 08 and it's carbon neutral -- &gt; Everything about the hotel was great from the service to the cleanliness of the rooms to the restaurant of the hotel.The hotel looks beautiful from the outside, a huge wooden door a paved entrance with bamboo trees (at least I believe they were) and as you walk in, you just feel relaxed.We arrived in the early evening, check in was easy and quick. We were then taken to the room and asked if we needed a reservation for dinner. The staff remembered our names during the entire stay which made us very comfortable .We stayed in a garden view studio. The room is big, the bed was not to hard and not too soft just perfect and there was a bathtub next to the bed. the room had everything we needed and there was a DVD player (they even had a couple of movies and there is more at the reception to borrow) and an ipod speaker.For our last night we had dinner at the hotel restaurant which is called room 28 (I've ordered some chips and salad that were great with the roomservice ), the food there is delightful and it was a good break from all the asian food we've been having. It seems liek a lot of expats who live there dine there as well. It's a very cool hotel and we enjoyed our stay there. If you are looking for a nice place to stay in Shanghai, want some peaceful feel to it and for it to be trendy then you should definately stay at the URBN. "
urbn hotel ,"Excellent Boutique hotel with superb relaxing atmosfeer Took my wife for a surpise night out. Staff on arrival most helpfull and friendly and very important: all perfect english speaking which is not all that common in China. Everything was ready. No confussion about anything. We stayed in the courtyard suite which was superb. The room was equiped with everything necessary including a little outside patio with in the back a seperate room with a huge Jacuzzi from which you have the option to watch a movie of your choice, from the dvd selection that is in the room, on a large flatscreen. Wonderfull. Beware: you'll be extremely wrinkled if you watch a complete movie... Loved it.The whole hotel is very stylish decorated which gives you a very relaxing feeling. We very much like good food and the restaurant did definately not dissapoint us. Here also all staff english speaking and very good service. Very good menu with excellent selection. All in all a very well spend day. We really enjoyed it! "
urbn hotel ,"very relaxing and comfortable I stayed for a few days in Shanghai and the last 2 nights in that fantastic URBN hotel. It was perfect to relax at the end of the vacation because of the whole flair of this place. The design is outstanding, the rooms are comfortable and very clean and the friendly staff was very helpful at any time.I really enjoyed the great bathroom with a kind of rain shower in the middle the room and the huge bathtub. The 24 hour room service delivers also awesome food for an axceptable price. The WiFi internet was also included as the big TV with international channels. There were a DVD player and some English movies in the room as well. In the end I have to mention the very friendly staff. There was no time they declined a request (e.g. cleaning the cloak at 5am) and that always with a smile and eye contact!I will definitely go there again! "
urbn hotel ,"A Superb! URBN is outstanding! From the location, facade design, theme, rooms and ofcourse their super friendly and cordial staff, I just fell in love with all of it. With the nature of my job, being an event planner, I frequent five star hotels.Things are pretty one and the same in most hotels i've been, like things are kinda expected but with URBN it totally made a mark. The whole property might be pretty small but everything just came out to be perfect than expected.The rooms are really something that you don't even want to leave. Really comfortable beds, first class sheets and the room designs are exquisitely done. Then top it with very friendly and pleasant staffs. I can just remember vividly my whole stay at URBN. "
urbn hotel ,"Classy hotel in an intimate setting I recently spent two nights at the URBN Hotel in Shanghai. Located on a nondescript side street just north of the Jing An Temple, URBN is located a bit further away from common tourist destinations (People's Square, the Bund, Pudong) than the big-name hotels, though it is a fairly short walk to the Metro line 2, and to the shopping district along Nanjing Road W.The design of the hotel is quite lovely and soothing. The main floor encompasses reception and a restaurant (Room 28), plus some lounge seating areas for visitors. The restaurant was quite nice, with a good selection for weekend brunch, dinner, and the morning buffet/a la carte service.My friend and I were each in a Garden View room (with large south-facing windows overlooking the courtyard), and our rooms were quite spacious. The rooms have more storage space than is imaginable: two large closets, bathroom storage cabinets, dressers, shelves and more. The layout is nice, as well; while the bed is in the middle of the room, there is a sunken living room between the bed and the window, creating a distinctly different space for lounging. One frustration with the room was that there were no fewer than five different places in the room for lightswitches, with no central means of turning lights on/off, making it a bit of a scramble to figure out how to turn off individual lighting schemes. Another was that there was a yoga/exercise kit in the closet for guest use -- with a small tag on it noting that, if opened, the hotel would charge the guest and the guest could take the kit home. Considering that the cost of the kit was rather high (USD$50-60?) and that I had just stayed at a hotel that offered two yoga mats in the room for guest use for free, I was a little put off.Our only other concern with the property was that restaurant reservation requests that we had sent to the hotel (in a follow-up to a concierge introduction email presenting that option) were missed or ignored, so we had to modify plans after our arrival.Overall, the experience of staying at URBN Hotel Shanghai was quite good. It provided more warmth and charm than the larger tourist/business-grade hotels, and helped me explore a new part of the city.--As a side note: Presented as &quot;China's 1st Carbon Neutral Hotel&quot;, one might expect super-green practices to be in place at URBN (think: composting toilets, all energy efficient appliances, high-efficiency weatherproofing), but this claim is instead upheld by the hotel's investment in carbon credits. It's a nice claim for them to have, but there could probably be more done by staff and guests alike to minimize the impact of operations. "
urbn hotel ,"URBN Exceeded My Expecations I have traveled to China a few times now and was turned onto this hotel by a friend. I was very impressed. The service was excellent, to say nothing of the accommodations. People were friendly and extremely helpful. I speak no Chinese and they were able to more than make up for that with excellent English. The rooms were so beautiful. After a day in meetings and out in the busy, draining atmosphere of the city, it was like coming to a peaceful oasis. I have stayed in hotels all over the world both “budget” and “luxury” and URBN is not in my top-five choices. People, atmosphere and extra touches all made me feel like I was having an authentic Asian experience with the comforts that I don’t want to leave behind from home. "
urbn hotel ,"Disappointing Stayed here for a few days in October 2008, really not a good hotel experience.URBN is lacking the character that makes a great hotel, on the surface (i.e. before you have stayed there) it seems to have it - great looking design, great idea going carbon neutral - however after a day or so I realised that these superficial qualities were not backed with substance - the service was lacking and many things that should be standard in a decent hotel either did not work or were not available.Luxury is about going that step further, URBN falls short of even the basic criteria for a 4* hotel, let alone a luxury one. "
urbn hotel ,"Christmas at URBN hotel Shanghai Coming from Hong Kong, we are used to great and out of the ordinary hotels already but the URBN hotel in Shanghai is definitely something different.We booked a Studio Lounge and the room was exactly what they tell you on their web site: “designer’s choice”Totally different than a normal 5 star hotel room: the bad tub was next to the bed in the middle of the room, the bed and the living area were integrated into one huge living space and there was a lot of storage space (esp. compared to the cramped wardrobes we usually see in hotel rooms)to store your stuff. Still some small things were missing, the TV had only 2 channels, but the hotel offers a huge selection of dvd’s and this was better because I could catch up on some movies I missed. From previous visits in China I remember that most TV channels are in Mandarin anyway. An intriguing language, but I don't master it. One things to be aware of is that the room has various different levels which might be inconvenient for disabled people or people traveling with you. The room had free WiFi, which is still very rare for Chinese hotels. Many hotels just charge ridiculous prices to use internet. There was no good mirror in the room if you want to look at your self and try to shave in the bath room was difficult as there was no good mirror and it was a bit dark.As it was Christmas, I had some friends over for dinner and this was just great, a real Turkey dinner with trimmings. The staff is great in the hotel and on Christmas day the General Manager was there to wish every one Merry Christmas. A real personal touch that we really appreciated. I can understand that some people without some understanding of this hotel’s feel &amp; design would not like it here but it is totally chic and stands out on his own, without throwing in the usual big designer names. Great stay, great food, super room, I shall definitely come back! "
urbn hotel ,"More upscale hostel than boutique hotel Good:Attractive dining area, pleasant outdoor space in good weather, hip vibe, comfortable beds with quality linens, well-stocked mini-bar, interesting location, flat screen t.v.'s with DVD library, iPod/iPhone music dock, free WiFi, good pre-arrival assistance with plans.Bad:Smoking is permitted in the open lobby / bar area, which is immediately adjacent to the dining room and reception desk. Smoking is not permitted in the dining room, but the dining room is open and directly connected to the smoke-filled lobby bar -- miserable for non-smokers, to whom I would not recommend this hotel.Overall, the hotel feels more like an upscale youth hostel than the charming boutique hotel it appears on the Web site: front desk service is a bit disorganized and nonchalant (we were given the wrong address, in Chinese, to a restaurant despite the fact it had been booked by the hotel); the building materials are not the greatest (possibly this is in keeping with the carbon-neutral theme of the hotel -- renewable materials and all -- but the construction is not wearing well and it is poorly insulated for an ostensibly energy-efficient building); and service was hit-or-miss (one day we received full turndown service; another day, nothing; a third day, we received turndown for one not two persons).Also, the breakfast food from the menu is quite close to terrible (though the continental breakfast buffet is fine).All-in-all, this hotel was a disappointment at its price. At half the price, it would have been a wonderful find. At this price, more is expected. "
urbn hotel ,"Over hyped and under delivered My partner and I booked the URBN as a final treat after six weeks of travelling through Canada and Europe - this was meant to be two days of comfort before the final leg of journey home to Melbourne. We'd both read much about URBN in Vogue Travel, Conde Naste Traveller etc. so spent a bit more than we would have normally to stay here. We were both dissapointed to find that the hotel which was promoted as 'boutique' is actually far from it - there are no facilities, the finish is cheap and the whole feel of the place is a bit off. The bathrooms are finished in cheap slate with sharp edges and the wood is slimy - I wouldn't rest my toothbrush on the bench. There was no cable television - the hotel claimed it was govt censorship! Strangely the JIA seemed to have more channels than we had in Melbourne! This is all hype - the hotel is 4 star at best and is cheaply finished and not to what I would call western standards. Nothing in the room looked like something I should have paid AUS$400 a night for. Concierge service was reluctant and the desk staff had attitude. We checked out after two days and stayed at the JIA - the two hotels cannot be compared. See my review for JIA and you'll understand why. "
urbn hotel ,"I won't go back.......... The Urbn Hotel Shanghai October 2008This new hotel in Shanghai where I stayed for 5 nights is well situated near to many restaurants and the famous Nanjing road for high end shopping and the fake market.We arrived in the evening and the attractive outside courtyard - thru which you enter - lobby, lounge and restaurant are very welcoming. Sadly during the day these areas are seemingly used by the hotel management as office working space creating an unprofessional atmosphere and a rather awkward ambience for guests wishing to use these particular facilities.The bedrooms are modern in design but unfortunately very user unfriendly with sunken baths which in my view are quite dangerous being surrounded by slate which becomes very slippery when wet added to which they are exceptionally awkward to get in and out of.To reach the sunken seating areas you need to be relatively agile and must avoid sharp corners and dark lurking steps. The rooms are dark and dreary therefore needing lights on at all times. Beds are comfortable, TVs did not work (only two channels - non English!) despite assurances this would be fixed.The young trendy staff were always helpful and obliging but I felt a certain lack of direction as far as the management was concerned. "
urbn hotel ,"Brilliantly urbane I had a milestone birthday in October and this was our trip to celebrate -- and what a celebration. This is a gorgeous hotel, centrally located, with quite lovely amenities. The rooms are gigantic, with their own seating areas, and a lovely view of bamboo through courtyard.A few oddities to mention: first, the bathroom design. It's very glamorous but you do have to pay attention to where the water's going -- we found the floor wasn't canted quite as much as it probably ought to have been. The TV does indeed only get a few channels. When we arrived, the hotel included a notice explaining that the government had cracked down on satellite service and that the management was trying to find alternatives. I'm not sure they've been able to; here in Hong Kong, this bit of Olympics-driven paranoia was pretty widely covered so it hardly surprised us.But the pluses were so many. There's a nifty little bar on the fourth floor, quite nice, and the restaurant is quite beautiful (although expensive so we decided to eat elsewhere).The service was quite competent, if not super-warm. That, from what Chinese friends who've lived in Shanghai have told us, is rather part of Shanghai's culture. Oh, and the location really is tough to bit, right near a subway station and on the border between the International Settlement and the French Concession. Walking around was itself a huge pleasure. "
urbn hotel ,"a relaxing oasis in bustling shanghai... When I arrived at URBN, I was exhausted and irritable from my 20 hour flight from Canada, couldn't wait to set my things down. My taxi pulled up in front of this huge, beautiful wooden gate and URBN staff was actually there waiting for me. As I walked into the courtyard, I knew instantly that I had found an oasis within the hectic city. There were several fountains that drained out the noise from the streets and more greenery than I thought possible in Shanghai. The lobby and rooms were even more impressive. The service was friendly and quick -- I was in my room before I knew it, relaxing in my sunken lounge while running a bath in the japanese style free-standing tub. As a nice touch, I received a phone call a few hours later from someone at the hotel's management, inviting me to enjoy a complimentary cocktail in the private lounge. I ended up in there till late and met tons of interesting people. THe next day, I got another call, inviting me to an exclusive art exhibit opening, Yoko Ono's art debut in China. That had to be my favourite part of the hotel. It's small enough that you feel like you get special attention and are well taken care of. The front desk was very useful when I had questions about where to go in Shanghai, they suggested restaurants, shopping and wrote down addresses for me. All in all, I had a great experience at URBN and will be back whenever I get another chance to go to Shanghai. "
urbn hotel ,"URBN design is beautiful but service was extremely disappointing Stayed at URBN for four nights while on vacation in Shanghai the last week of October. All the press and reviews of this hotel are mainly true - the rooms are beautifully designed and a soothing oasis within the hectic city. We stayed in an Atrium room, and the all black bathroom was quite unique and impressive. The location of the hotel is good - in a bustling, more residential part of the city. Unfortunately, our stay was tainted by the terrible service we received from staff during our entire stay. From the moment that we checked in, we were treated with a total lack of interest to help us. There were always several people behind the front desk at any given time, but they always seemed more interested in talking to each other and surfing the web than greeting us or answering our questions. In a city as overwhelming as Shanghai - it would've been nice to feel like we were being taken care of. We didn't have a safe in our room upon check-in and the staff did not have interest in placing one in there until I requested it twice. The common excuse I got when I asked a question (my missing safe, no more than 3 Chinese TV channels, no more than 5 outdated DVDs available from their &quot;catalog&quot;) was that this is a new hotel. Since this hotel has been open for almost a year, I didn't find that to be a good reason. And lastly, on our very first morning, we were given a very chilly warning by hotel management for bringing outside breakfast snacks to eat in the hotel outdoor dining space since that was &quot;commercial space&quot;. I understand that we shouldn't be eating our own food in the hotel restaurant, but it was 8am and we were sitting there for no more than 5 minutes. Since the manager hadn't met us before, I think it would've been nice to warmly welcome us to the hotel first before scolding us to please eat our own food in our room. This unfriendly encounter is not something I expect to have when we are only one of 26 guests staying at a hotel?! it was disappointing. The design and location are great, but I would not go back or recommend URBN to anyone else. "
urbn hotel ,"Extremely Relaxing The URBN in Shanghai was exactly what my husband and I needed after a grueling 3 days the bamboo forest, Yellow Mountain, and Suzhou. We spent two nights here in hopes of catching a glimpse of Shanghai on our whirlwind China trip. The staff was very helpful and arranged dinner reservations as well as hailed taxis for us. They spoke excellent English and were always willing to help at any time. The beds were perfect. Everything was very clean. The smell was fresh and nice. Our room was closest to the street but we didn't even hear the sounds of the Shanghai traffic. The elements of color and design inside this hotel are very pleasing. The only thing we did not like was the restaurant at the hotel. Though they served us an excellent western breakfast in our room, the dinner the night before was very mediocre. The preparations were fine but the specific food combinations did not please my palate. If we go to Shanghai again, we would stay at the URBN. "
urbn hotel ,"One in a million hotel I've stayed in a thousand hotels, in 15 countries. I've never had a GM sit with me and my travel companion at breakfast twice to write out suggested place to visit and help us plan our travels.I've never had a hotel staff walk with me to local restaurant and help me order dinner in a restaurant that has no english menu.At truly unique experience. I will be shocked if i ever stay in a different hotel in Shanghai. "
urbn hotel ,"will be back just came back from a weekend at the Urbn hotel, got in after midnight from a delayed flight, the hotel whether in the day time or at night is quite a little oasis from the hustle/bustle of Shanghai, the courtyard dining area, check in area &amp; overall design of the public areas &amp; rooms are really nice/hipI liked my room's simple, stylish &amp; spacious design (didn't bring a camera this time), for a studio room I wasn't expecting much but the room was was really spacious (felt around 800 sq ft) well designed &amp; definitely green &amp; hip at the same timefood was healthy &amp; tasty, service was in general quite goodonly 2 reasons not a 5 /5 rating 1) booked a 2 hour in room massage, they use an outside company, and the masseur was 1/2 an hour late2) not the easiest place to get a cab, waited quite a bit on Sat (with myself &amp; a hotel staff on each side of the street)3) while a nice hotel for this price, this is not a luxurious hotel but nonetheless a nice hotelthis is the type of hotel I 'd come back to over &amp; over again (I liked the location &amp; know the area well, +I prefer smaller hotels with less rooms) and would recommend it to my friends, but for the rest of my friends/colleagues that are used to park hyatt type hotels this is not the hotel for themstill, I would come back, if for nothing else, their effort to be carbon neutral deserves kudos "
urbn hotel ,"URBN - west truly meets east.... It is a very simple story. This is a first rate hotel. It is the only hotel that I have stayed in, in Shanghai where they actually serve a good coffee, which has a great steak, where the rooms are homely (though very cool and hip) without being too homely, where the staff are not automated big-hotel drones, where the building has a feel of Shanghai before the big towers went up, which is in a truly great location (not too close / not too far away), where you are compelled to drink in the private bar or rent out the penthouse and roof garden to drink away the night. It is without doubt a great place to stay, is striking and memorable. "
urbn hotel ,"An oasis in Shanghai What an amazing find, an oasis in the middle of busy bustling Shanghai, behind the impressive wooden gate is a hotel that is so inviting it could be your &quot;home away from home&quot;. The ambience is ideal and starts the minute you walk behind the gates. You are greeted by friendly staff in the garden that oozes tranquility and is ideal for a meal or a relaxing drink. The rooms are spacious and offer all the modern conveniences, I especially liked the Ipod stand, not to mention the heavenly bath or the beds that feel you like you are sleeping in a cloud. It's heaven!I would highly recommend this hotel not only for it's cutting edge design, excellent location and first class facilities but for it's concerns to the environment. It sure beats staying at one of those predictable, impersonal hotels!VERY IMPRESSIVE. "
urbn hotel ,"Cool Oasis in Shanghai I have been travelling to Shanghai for over 10 years and have never found a hotel that mixes style, convenience, an authentic experience and comfort - until I stayed at Urbn. Urbn first caught my eye for the fact that it is carbon neutral and I wasn’t disappointed. I stayed in June 2008 with my wife for a trip where I wanted to combine business and pleasure and found the fitout to be luxurious and hip, the staff were helpful and knowledgeable, the food in the restaurant was top notch and best of all, the rooms were the most spacious that I have ever stayed in. We especially liked the lounge area in our room, which you never get at those big chain hotels - where you always have to sit on the bed. Shanghai can be hectic at the best of times, so my wife and I really looked forward to getting back to the oasis of Urbnm with its garden and relaxed vibe. As soon as you walk through the large wooden gates, you instantly feel like you have entered your own secret hideaway in Shanghai. I highly recommend Urbn and will definitely be heading back there again! "
urbn hotel ,"A great find in Shanghai! We were amazed by Shanghai, if you are really into major world-class cities then this is a place you cannot miss, it's kind of a mixture between Hong Kong, Manhattan and Gotham City!Naturally though, the experience of a city is always meliorated by staying at a phenomenal hotel, and we are confident we have found one!If you are not interested in staying in one of the big chains and fancy something a little different and 'boutiquey' then Urbn is definitely the place to stay. As you enter through an enormous wooden door from the hustle bustle of the street, you really do enter an oasis of water fountains and palm trees, it's a peaceful and serene place - thankfully they only have 26 rooms so you are never going to be surrounded by hundreds of people. The hotel is, what can we say, stunning. You are greeted in the reception area by a wall of leather suitcases (sounds silly but it works) and the hotel is decked out entirely in slate and reclaimed mahogany. Our room was not only enormous but it came complete with an outdoor garden, it had all the amenities you would wish for including wireless internet and a speaker connection for your Ipod. Our room was superbly decorated without being over the top, so it was a great place to spend a few relaxing afternoons escaping from the overwhelming heat of July.The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful and all smiles. We did not eat at the restaurant, but we managed to drink enough alcohol to kill a family of six as of the hidden gems of this hotel is a tiny private bar on the 4th floor. In the evening they play funky tunes and project kung fu films from the 1970s on the wall - so after dinner we would always end up here for a nightcap. The Food and Beverage manager is Australian and he takes pride in inventing delicious cocktails (such as a goji berry martini).We stayed for a total of 6 nights and didn't want to leave, which is rare as we are both quite picky about where we stay and also get bored rather easily, but this place was just fab. If you are visiting Shanghai you'd be mad not to stay there. "
urbn hotel ,"Slickness meets Sleekness I had just ended a long camping trip in the South of China, and arrived in Shanghai with no reservation. After this long trip, sleeping in tents and hostels, I craved a night or two of comfort.I researched a few of Shanghai's upscale hotels on the internet and decided to pass on the luxurious monstrosities. Instead, I found the URBN hotel, a new eco-friendly boutique establishment. Having enjoyed nature for the past couple weeks, I felt that a carbon-neutral hotel was appropriate for my next couple nights.An incredibly friendly, english-speaking staff checked me in to my even more-comfortable and incredibly designed room. Slick couches were built into the wall; my shower was huge and the bench inside made it perfect to just sit and soak. Everything was new, the smell was fresh. I just sat in my comfortable bed all night listening to music (the provide an ipod sound dock!) and watching a huge flat screen for the first time in months...I'm not typically a hotel blogger, but I have to give you a heads up on this one. If you do stay there, you will be sure to see the owners around the hotel. Make sure to ask them to check out the private bar! "
urbn hotel ,"Style for Miles I spent a weekend at URBN when it first opened in early 2008. In a fantastic location the design has created a special ambience for a stay in down town Shanghai. The rooms are spacious with an excellent design allowing an easy flow from bath to bed to living area. The amenities and services are A class. The retaurant has an excellent selection and the food is great. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I visit Shanghai, it's got it all and behind the large front doors and high walls you hardly know you are in the centre of town. "
urbn hotel ,"Inner Beauty The concept is well ahead of its time for China. Urbn is an Oasis in the dioxine desert of Shanghai! Beautiful interiors, well located, friendly bilingual staff. I think its probably got the most comfortable beds in the city too. But the Hotel's real inner beauty comes from them being carbon neutral - more of this please. Hopefully, we'll see them in Beijing and other cities too. "
urbn hotel ,"URBNize ur life Stayed at URBN hotel for a few days in the month of April and have been meaning to write a review for it. Stayed at a few hotels in Shanghai and all in all must say URBN hotel is definitely your choice if you are looking for a personalized and different experience in Shanghai. After several good nights rest in probably one of the most comfortable beds in town, I am rest assured knowing that my stay has left minimal impact on the environment. Its definitely the minor details that made my stay enjoyable, from the heated floors in the showers , the movable/rotating flat screen tv, to the high quality IPOD speaker dock, I can see that URBN went above and beyond and addressed all of your needs to ensure that you have a comfortable stay. The staff was always attentive and addressed you by your name and the restaurant with its nouveau Australian styled cuisine can be enjoyed at any hour of the day. Another plus was that when you step backed into your room, you have a view of the garden, a pair 100 year old magnolia trees and the Jing-an skyline to accompany u while u read and enjoy the quiet oasis that is rare in this hustling and bustling city of Shanghai. "
urbn hotel ,"A hip and luxurious home-away-from home in Shanghai I travel for business and pleasure more than half the year and, all together, have lived in hotels more than seven years of my life. This sort of lifestyle is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on where you get to stay. In Shanghai, cosmopolitan and sexy city that it is, finding the perfect hotel is surprisingly difficult. With the addition of URBN, an authentic, comfortable, and hip home-away-from-home is now part of the local hotel landscape.I stayed at URBN on a business trip for 10 days back in June shortly after they officially opened. The first thing that struck me about the hotel is how physically beautiful it is both inside and outside. It is quite simply a really handsome hotel. Unlike the other boutique hotels in Shanghai, URBN is built as part of the local environment, developed from the shell of an old warehouse/post office in the calm, leafy, residential neighborhood of Jing An. The materials used to renovate this unique location are also part of the local environment: rich, gleaming hardwoods and the characteristic slate gray Shanghai brick. The effect is striking, totally unique, and unusually comforting. All great qualities in a hotel, particularly in constantly frenetic Shanghai.Hidden away behind it's secret garden gate in a neighborhood filled with great restaurants, a DVD store right across the street, a hip new gym around the corner, and a short walk from the bling bling of Plaza 66 shopping, this is the perfect location for travelers wanting an uncompromising hotel experience with the authentic feel of actually living in Shanghai.The rooms are all extra large, designed to be one room suites, with a super-comfortable sunken seating area suitable for entertaining small groups of guests or for lounging around with your laptop or watching a DVD on the enourmous flat screen TV. I took a tour of the hotel and found that all of the rooms are great value for the money, much larger than the average in Shanghai. For a bit more, you can have a rooftop duplex suite complete with wet bar or a room with an ensuite terrace overlooking the garden fountain and a separate private hot tub complete with it's own TV (I think this is Room 8 ;-).Room service and the restaurant are great, especially for people who appreciate healthy food. I ate there almost everyday sometimes two meals per day and never got tired of the menu. The staff are friendly and helpful and contribute to the feeling of staying at a private club or someone's ultra-luxurious home.The hotel also offers unique services that bring different elements of Shanghai in from the surrounding city, like Chinese lessons, tai chi classes, a guest membership at the hip gym around the corner, and other similar unique experiences. Together with the hotel's location and design, these unique touches all add up to making one feel like a hip local rather than just another visiting tourist to Shanghai. As a hybrid business-pleasure traveler, I've always struggled with the compromise between staying at business class hotels with all their services and amenities and the rewardingly unique experience of boutique properties. I think URBN sets a new standard in this category, carefully selecting services without compromise and delivering them in a way that feels totally personal. "
urbn hotel ,"Sensational on all levels URBn Hotel,A little piece of serenity in a hectic city. Central to the hub and pulse of the city, the hotel interior and design was amazing and the rooms are like nothing i have ever experienced before. The staff are super friendly, help ful and informative. Loved the restaurant down stairs. I recommend this hotel for any traveller looking for a unique, friendly and great value hotel in Shanghai, Definitely be coming back to stay and will recommend to all travellers passing through.Well done GUYS!!Andy HannaganAustralia "
urbn hotel ,"The real thing URBN was a great place to stay - small, personal, private, cool, and giving you a peek into the &quot;real&quot; Shanghai ... all while being hip and luxurious. Great location, I highly recommend it. "
urbn hotel ,"Peaceful Stay at URBN I'm an american expat living in Shanghai and walk past this very interesting boutique hotel everyday since it opened on my way home. I saw online that it was offering &quot;soft opening&quot; rates, so my husband and I decided to check it out and have a romantic night &quot;away&quot;.I find it very exciting because it is the first carbon neutral hotel in China. Once you've set foot in the entrance, the entire setting of the hotel makes you feel like you've been transported away from downtown Shanghai. (which trust me, is hard to do) They've reused wood to create this bamboo forest-esque atmosphere. It's all very zen-like and very peaceful.The rooms are very unique - they all feature HUGE beds, sunken bathtubs (in the bedroom!) and beautiful sunken living/lounge. Even though it's all very peaceful and zen like they don't skimp on high technology. They have flat screen TV's, wireless, and DVD players and some rooms also have ipod docking stations (i think). However this isn't a hotel for a business traveler, there isn't the traditional desk or table in the room, just the long sofa. The rooms are beautiful though, featuring all reused wood and stone from Shanghai buildings that have been torn down. Since I did stay during the soft opening, the staff wasn't quite at the top of their game. We did order room service and it took them a couple of times to understand my order in english. Also when we checked in it took them awhile to get everything organized. I assume these things will have been perfected for the actual opening of the hotel. All in all I would certainly suggest this to anyone coming to town looking for a high end boutique hotel to stay in. It has so much more personality than any of the chain hotels in Shanghai for the same price. Beautiful hotel with a great concept (carbon neutral)! "
urbn hotel ,Acojedor y fabuloso 
urbn hotel ,????????????? 
utels shanghai wuning ,Great hostel but kitchen needs improvement big and nice rooms and overall good experience. staff is helpfulkitchen opening times need to be mentioned as we tried to order lunch at 11:15 am and they could not make fried rice yet.Overall nice place and easy to get taxis and a short walk to the subway. 
utels shanghai wuning ,"Pleasantly surprised..... Getting to the hostel across Wuning road..... is an achievement in itself, but aside from that - it is a lovely hostel:)We are backpacking for 8 months and we had a twin room with ensuite, however the facilities were such that i could have easily used the dorms. The washroom facilities were excellent and cleaned everyday. Our ensuite was quite large and had a separate shower cubicle (a luxury!) and was extremely clean. The staff were helpful, if a little harrassed!! We stayed during the eclipse and it was very busy. Breakfast is ok, computers are good (but not free as advertised , ok only 1 Yuen per 15 mins but that isnt free!!). The food is good in the restaurant. Relatively close to the subway and easy to get around. Shanghai was disappointed but we werent by this hostel - would definietly recommend. "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Phone Stolen from locked private room in this hostel....awful experience! On the surface this hostel is clean and seems well run but having had my mobile phone stolen out of my locked private room here, I would suggest to anyone considering this place to avoid it all costs! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week as part of a 6 month round the world trip adn 4 weeks spent in China. This was the only place we experienced any robbery. After visiting nearly 40 hostels in 6 months that says something!When we told the hostel staff that my phone was missing and we wanted to report it to the police, they sent a member of the reception team to the police station with us and told us to lie.The guy from the hostel did all the talking to the police but refused to tell them my phone had been stolen in the hostel and made up a story that I had been mugged in the street. He then told me to sign a statement which he had made with the police officer and when I said I wanted him to sign it as well he became really aggressive and starting shouting at me. I was really frightened as was my boyfriend who has travelled the world with me twice and we have never experienced anything like that!I found the majority of staff to seem sweet and innocent before my phone was stolen but afterwards there was definitely an intimidating under current with them and they would hang around glaring at the foreigners in the reception area where there is the internet access and bar. It seemed like there might have been some sort of organised crime going on in there and everyone was in on it. Conveniently the security guard had a phone indentical to mine that he was fixated with and playing around with all day, the day after mine was stolen. V strange! "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Big bustling hostel This hostel is not in the most picturesque part of Shanghai, and getting to it across the manic Wuning Rd is something of an achievement. The hostel itself is set back from the road in a sort of cul-de-sac, so is shielded from the worst of the noise from the road. It is a huge place. There are two residential blocks, a large reception/internet/seating area linking the two blocks and a large bar leading off that. As a single traveller in Shanghai for work, I thought it would be a good place to meet people. However, the socialising aspects were far outweighed by the inconvenience of the location and the general standard of the facilities. There are two showers and two toilets for each sex on each floor, and although I never had to queue, they did get pretty smelly and dirty. There are hot water rooms on every other floor, and one kitchen and two washing machines per block. This makes it really inconvenient if you want to make yourself a cup of coffee or heat up some noodles. The bar does food, and it is reasonably priced and tasty- but make sure they put your order into their computer or prepare for an unpleasant stand-off with the staff when your dinner doesn't come. There is also a buffet breakfast included in the room price, but it is not great- cereal, (cold) steamed buns and red bean porridge. The internet is intolerably slow and with only seven terminals between 500 travellers be prepared for a long wait. Finally, this is not a hostel for anyone who needs a good nights' rest. The long, institutional corridors magnify every sound- particularly people who have locked themselves out of their rooms in the early hours.Having said all that, if you're after a big, fun, cheap hostel where you can drink cheap beers with fellow travellers over a game of pool or FIFA on the PS2 during your week in Shanghai, then this might be just the place for you. "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Impressed! We're three girls mid 20's sharing a triple private ensuite in this hostel and in the week and a half we have been here we have been very impressed. Contrary to the name, the hostel is definitely not city centre, however having read other reviews on this website we knew that before we came and realised being central would be way over our budget. It's really easy to pick up a taxi outside the hostel and takes about 15 minutes to get to People's Square, costing less than £3.00. Our room is pretty large and gets cleaned every day, we're getting towels replaced and some free items such as toothbrushes and shampoo have been provided. The staff seem really nice. There's air conditioning in the room which appears to be free of charge and the internet (via lan cable) is slow, especially at peak times, but it works. The shower is hot and a good pressure. We went to the restaurant one night. We were not expecting it to be great but we really enjoyed it. We were after a western fix and the pasta and pizza were very tasty and tasted really fresh. We had some noisy neighbours a couple of nights which was annoying but part and parcel of staying in a hostel so we didn't complain and they didn't stay long. Some of the reviews mentioned the beds being hard, and they are firm but we haven't had any problems sleeping in that respect. It's definitely worth taking the hostel card out which has the address in Chinese as well as a small map on the back, as hardly any taxi drivers speak or read English, and if you come from the airport in a taxi make sure you have the address printed as it's down a side street which would be pretty difficult to find first time.The hostel is very close to a subway station also.If I return to Shanghai I'd definitely stay here again. "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Just great After having travelled for a month around the northeast of China and having visited 6 cities and 6 different hostels, I can say this is the best of all!! Clean, modern, new, the staff are nice and speak english, they offer a free breakfast (very good by the way!!), free internet that works and enough PC's!!! And a free shuttel bus to the city center (the subway station is not far either). The lounge and bar area are also great. This is the place to stay in Shanghai!! "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Great hostel in Shanghai I stayed at this youth hostel for a week. The hostel itself is large and many of the facilities are more hotel-like, especially the single and double rooms, which I both tried (see below). The hostel facilities are good. There is free internet, free in-room (slow) wifi, TVs in all rooms, and air conditioning in the rooms. The bar/restaurant area is pleasant and a good place to meet people in the evenings. There are laundry facilities and the hostel staff can help with booking train tickets, airport rides and other transport.At first I was in a standard single room on the ground floor. The room was ok, with a single bed and free wifi, a toilet and shower, and a kettle with green tea sachets. However, the bed was super-hard, and space was kinda limited. There are only two small lights in the room, which made it dark – and the desk lamp kept spluttering so I tried not to touch it. Add to that the fact that the windows gave out onto the front entrance, which also made it noisy when people congregate outside for a smoke or a chat. Lastly, the air conditioning unit in all rooms has controls in Chinese – and the handset in the room stopped working after a short while, which only gave me the choice of having the unit off, or on full blast. My stay in a single room was short, however, as one dark morning a storm moved in over Shanghai, and a very big leak opened in the ceiling of the room, flooding the floor. The staff was very quick and efficient in moving me to a double room.Double rooms are similar to single rooms, but overall more pleasant – more space, the air con unit was newer, the beds were thankfully softer. You also get better quality shampoo, I noticed....although I’d recommend to buy shampoo in the supermarket. Getting to the hostel is easy as long as you have taxi directions in Chinese, and remember that the road is not Wuning Nan Road, but Wuning Road proper. You can also get there by metro (Caoyang St. stop), but I can see how that could be a bit confusing, as the metro station has 3 different exits. The rule of thumb is, exit the metro, turn right and follow the tracks a short distance towards an intersection of two big roads, one of which is Wunin. Cross the road (taking good care), and the hostel is a short ways through a gated entrance to your right.Around the hostel, you can find some cheap places to eat. If you walk out onto Wuning Rd and turn right, you can find a meal for 10 yuan. There is also a small shop just outside the hotel, but the owner’s livelihood seems to depend on fleecing non-Chinese tourists....a bottle of Nongfu Spring water there cost me 5 yuan (more than I would pay for a bottle of water in Europe!), but at any Family Mart in Shanghai the standard price is 1.7 yuan.The reception staff speaks English and is very pleasant and willing to help. The bar staff was a bit stand-offish when I was there, at one point shouting at me because I asked the same question twice (I did not understand the answer the first time....I was trying my best, but I’ve only taken a few months of Mandarin!).The only negatives about this hostel were the inconsistent room service - items were not necessarily replaced very often, such as shampoo or tea. Also, the wireless stopped working for a few days and none of the staff seemed to know why, or when it would be fixed - this left a lot of travellers having to line up for the free computers. Tip: the bar has ethernet points, and the front desk is more than happy to lend you ethernet cables if you need them. So if you have your own laptop, ethernet in the bar is a lot faster than wifi in your room. "
utels shanghai wuning ,"Great place not 5 star but incredible for the price When in China, do as the Romans do....This fantastic hostel has accomodations for sharing and private rooms, all incredibly cheap. I stayed in a private room for a month while taking a course and can not begin to expound on the wonderful staff, management and facilities. My only gripe was the really bad tp. You can buy your own cheap at the Carrefour down the street. One plus is a really amazing street market, behind the hostel. I bought eggs (by the ones) and fruit daily. mandarin oranges and the best apples. Cooked the eggs (hard boiled) in the electric teapot provided in the room.There is a house dog named Chris that loves or hates you. It became my mission to have him love me...he did, finally. "
villas 1931 hotel shanghai ,"Convenient 1) Cleaniness: room was clean.2) Location: centralised location with Nanjing Road is a short walk away, not too bad for the price and in comparison with the prices of hotels in the surrounding area.3) Rooms: for a local hotel the room was a bit small, but adequately equipped. There is no satellite TV, so we only had chinese channels. The bed was really hard though.4) Service: I would have had little complaints about this hotel if not for the service. We'd asked for a late check-out (for 2 pm) the night before and the next morning the reception called to ask abt our check-out. We told the lady that we arranged with her colleague the night before tht we were checking out late, and then she told us to make sure we were out of the room before 2pm. We turned up at the reception counter 15 mins late. And the lady then rudely and unnecessarily informed us &quot;It's past 2pm&quot; before proceeding with check-out.5) Value: Overall not bad value for the location, but do not expect any good service.

villas 1931 hotel shanghai ,"Can't Beat the Location Fantastic location only a 5 minute walk to the Bund, People's Park, and main shopping areas. The hotel was very clean and neat with a large room with a double bed- more than enough room for 2 people to be comfortable, with a desk and sitting area and spacious bathroom. The bed was solid as a rock and appeared to only be a box spring and no mattress which was strange.The breakfast was served next door in a restaurant which was overpriced and terrible with service to match. You are better off going elsewhere or picking up breakfast items at a bakery or convenience store. One of the added bonuses was the free internet and computer right in the hotel room. Staff weren't overly friendly but were still helpful. We had some problems checking out as the night staff speaks little to no English (day staff speak English so be sure to make arrangements for taxis or check-out during the day!). Make sure you bring proper documentation if you pay and book in advance through a website as the non-English speaking desk cleark tried to charge us for the room again as he failed to grasp the concept that we had paid in advance. Thanks to another guest who spoke Mandarin we were able to sort it all out. And there is a room deposit charge of about $30 Canadian that we never figured out what exactly it was for.Enough restaurants within walking distance. Other than the check-out problem which we were able to sort out, the hotel was a great place to stay for location and price. "

I paid 70 euros for a large room, with 2 large windows offering a nice view, a desk with a computer connected to internet for free, a sofa, and all the usual : minibar, safe, tea and coffee machine, etc.Only drawback : no english channels on the TV, but the rest is perfect for the price compared to other hotels I've been to in Shanghai.

The location is good, as it is a 3-5 minute walk to the train, making downtown an easy 10 minute ride away.The rooms must have recently been redone, as I found the fixtures and furnishings in great condition. A great room for a mid-range hotel. The heating also worked well, an important thing to note in Shanghai, where the weather and the reliability of heating systems can be unpredictable.The one thing that bothered me most was my interaction with the host at the spa (located on the upper ground level). I was sick during the trip, and thought a massage would do the trick. The rates were somewhat expensive for Asia, but I was floored when he said, &quot;sex massage only $XX.&quot; (I don't remember how much). I had to ask him to repeat it a few times, as I could not believe that I was being offered sex at the Best Western! All I kept thinking was what if a student had gone down!!!Anyway, the only other criticism I have is that the restaurant where the breakfast is held is really in need of refurbishing. Perhaps that is next on the list. Otherwise, a pleasant and positive experience. "
yafan longmen hotel ,"Close to train Nice Hotel, 4 stars are the right. There are masterpieces of carved wood.&quot;Bussines center&quot; with poor English and to expensive Internet connection. Wireless not working.The hotel is next to the train station, not far from the bus station, however 30-40min to the center with the taxi. "
yafan longmen hotel ,"No longer Best Western but still OK. This hotel ceased to be affiliated with the Best Western brand as of May 2008, but it remains a very useful &amp; comfortable place stay in Shanghai, especially for anyone needing/wanting a hotel very close to the main railway station (which is just a few minutes walk away - see pictures). "
yafan longmen hotel ,"Good Hotel Location just ok Surprisingly nice for a Best Western.Location is not ideal, it is next to the train station, which means taking taxi’s to get anywhere. Unlike Beijing or Xi’an, there is no taxi queue in front of the hotel. Flagging a taxi was mixed bag. The taxi’s at the adjacent train station were not interested in short runs. And there was no one at the hotel to help get a taxi either. Rooms were decent size, clean and well stocked. The king bedded rooms at the end of the halls were downright huge. No issues with service, everyone was pleasant and friendly. There was a small mix up when they reassigned one of our rooms to someone else, but that was solved almost immediately.Breakfast was actually quite good. Nice spread with lots of choices, the coffee was hot and refills were quick.Not a bad hotel at all, but the location is against it. Shanghai cabs can be a pain, and being dependent on cabs was not ideal. I prefer a hotel that has interesting stuff in walking range, and there are plenty of these in Shanghai "
yafan longmen hotel ,"Excellent hotel though a bit out of the way Got a very reasonable rate on this 3-4 star (by US standards) hotel. The rooms were immaculate, the staff was very helpful with english speaking help readily available. The breakfast was a little over-priced by Chinese standards but very good with lots of options. It is located in the everbright neighborhood near a shopping area, some fast food joints, and plenty of little shops where you can buy water, snacks, and extra luggage (if you're about to fly back and need more room for souvenirs).The only real negative about the hotel is that during rush hour, getting to many of the popular tourist attractions (the bund, french concession, nanjing street, etc) is a good 30-40minute taxi drive (still a cheap ride ... $3-4USD). Outside of rush hour, it was only ~10-15minutes. So if you're the type that likes to stop back at your hotel intermittently, then this is probably not the place for you. If like us, you only stop back perhaps once during the day and then crash in your room at the end of the night, this was a very reasonably priced (&lt;$70) place thats not too far. If this place was on the bund, the rooms would easily be running for $150+.The 2 complimentary waters daily were nice as well. "
yafan longmen hotel ,"Average; location ok; not the greatest hotel Hotel is newly built, so the rooms are clean, nice, and decent. However, the location is not ideal--while it is within walking distance to the train station and metro, etc, it is not convenient to find nice dining options or a general store nearby. The free breakfast is just ok. Stick with the plain porridge to be safe. The attempts at pastries should be complimented (they try), but better just to serve toast than concoctions. Staff is hit-and-miss, sometimes friendly and helpful, at other times they ignore you. "

zhao an hotel ,"Acceptable We stayed here as part of a Travelsphere holiday, our bedroom was clean however it smelt musty, it needs an overhaul, the food was good plenty of choice, it was ok for the time we were there, the hotels for the rest of the tour just got better and better. "
zhao an hotel ,"Shabby but good food. Fine if cheap Eighties bathrooms, nicotine stained walls and dated furnishings, however the food is good. We stayed as part of a Travelsphere tour and this was way below all the other hotels they use. A surprising choice. The bar was rarely open, the pool derelict and it was difficult to persuade staff to open the internet centre (although they forgot to charge for it). Next to a metro but not very central. If you get a good deal its not dire but don't pay full prices, you will be disappointed. "
zhao an hotel ,"Great location I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights one week apart.This hotel is locate right next (literally) to a subway station in line 1 (Hanzhong Road), one stop from the train station and 2 stops from the People's Square, both reachable easily and quickly on foot.The hotel is located in a good neighborhood and taxis will find it with no trouble. Nanjing Road is 10 minutes away on foot.The standard rooms were quite clean and spacious with a bed, closet, desk and bathroom.Beds were wide enough for 2 people (though I stayed alone) with good mattresses and linen. I didn't find the mattress too hard but some people might. Hard mattresses are quite common in China.The room was non-smoking and there were no smoke smells.The bathroom was clean, with a western style (american) toilet and a bathtub. The water pressure was not very strong but enough for a good shower. Standard amenities were offered (soap, shampoo, cap, toothbrush and paste) as well as the standard discardable flip flops in China.A nice thing were the 2 daily bottles of mineral water placed in the room.The room had an electrical thermos that made preparing tea or quick meals very easy and convenient.The rooms faced the main road but were quite quiet and naturally lit with large windows.Some minor details showed that the hotel was a little worn out such as loose internet connection plug, minor marks in the furniture and dents in the bathtub.Internet access had enough bandwidth for my needs and allowed for making computer to phone calls with good quality.The staff did everything in their power to help me at 11 PM regarding a problem with train tickets even when it wasn't their fault at all. I was given access to the business center and helped with contacting the travel agency.The only problem I had was that they booked a taxi to the airport even though I never asked them to. This created some minor friction at the very end of the trip.Summing everything this stay was great value for money and a great way to explore Shanghai.Recommended. "
zhao an hotel ,"Good deal for the money! This hotel was offered on Travelocity when we booked our (dirt cheap) flights. We got a great deal for 9 nights in a superior room at the Zhao An PLUS RT airfare from Charlotte, NC, USA for just over a grand! At that price I wasn't expected much but was pleasantly surprised. Since we were trying to save money, we decided to arrive at the hotel via the Maglev/metro straight to the Han Zhong metro station right under the hotel (note: there is not an escalator from the ticketing level to the exit 4 in this metro station-we did have to carry the bags up to the hotel entrance) . The flight touched down about 2.30 pm and by 4pm we were at the hotel and checked in with a smile! We had prepaid, however there was a key deposit, but that's normal in Chinese Hotels and was refunded when we left. The room we were given at first though was NOT a superior room and did not match the pictures shown on the hotel website. This first room was a tiny, tiny room with one full sized bed shoehorned in. After polite, but insistent negotiation with a junior manager (Neil) we were given the room next door for the same price, which had two full beds and was considerably larger. Both rooms were clean and well maintained, with a fridge, hot water kettle, tv etc. The beds were &quot;chinese-firm&quot;, and the bathroom spotless with plenty of hot water. The staff at the hotel were most accommodating and had some English skills, so that, with my broken Chinese we were able to communicate pretty well. The bellboys were especially helpful, as were the front desk staff. We had to have clothes cleaned and it was picked up and delivered very quickly.The best part of staying at the Zhao An was its location. Either by metro or by bus it's easy and cheap to get just about any where in Shanghai. Catycorner to the Hotel is a bank with an international ATM. There is a main South bound bus stop on the opposite side of the street just North of the hotel on Heng Tong lu with upwards of 10 lines. For example, the number 801 will take you to the Yuyuan Gardens (7 stops to Xin BeiMen, walk a block over). Coming back to the hotel by bus is easy too. Additionally, the main railway station is a couple of blocks away, and has restaurants and stores in the area.... including a Pizza Hut!They do have a breakfast buffet at the hotel. I thought it was a little expensive (8$ bucks), but they do have adequate food on it; some Western and some Chinese.All in all, I think this hotel is a great place to stay and I would stay again in a heart beat. "
zhao an hotel ,"Bare Necessities For less than $50 a night, we got a big room and big bed good enough for sleeping. The room is on the 14th floor (topmost) and looked a bit shabby; its carpet and wall paper have seen better days but for the price we paid, we were willing to overlook these aesthetics. We stayed at this hotel because it was accessible, the subway station exit was just next door, less than 1 minute walk. There is also a convenient store right across the street. For those travelling across China, I recommend the website www.ctrip.com (no worries, there is an english version), this is where we book our hotel room and the prices are unbeatable. It's a relatively safe website; Ctrip being listed in a major stock exchange. I used my credit card to book the hotels and everything went smoothly. "
zhao an hotel ,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS Stayed one night there on 2 Oct 2008.Room was clean but condition was very run down, water damaged ceiling and bare wood wardrobes. Room service tried to force open the door while it was chained off - happened twice.Did not bother to knock and wait for response.Did not get breakfast as per review here.Tried to extend another night, but refused same rate. They asked for more than double the rate i paid for first night. So i hired the internet to book another night through the same online agent in singapore.Internet was extremely slow and timeout all the time and it was charged by the minute. The business centre was not staffed and there was no paper to use for printing.Came back a few nights later because it was already paid for. Arrived at 4am. Was asked to wait until 10AM before allowed to check in. Another kind hearted reception allowed us to check in at 7AM.But her duty manager (Richard Cheong) refused entry for my fiancee because this time she accidentally left her purse in another bag which we left in another city. She was not asked for ID when we stayed for the first two nights. The manager took indifference stance to our problems. In his own words. &quot;One person can stay and the other have to go. If you dont want to stay we cannot refund the money, because It is not my problem.&quot; "
zhao an hotel ,"Good location The hotel is alongside a subway station but while the subway is clean considering the numbers using it, it is crowded so do not use it if carrying luggage. You have to carry your own luggage up from the taxi. Rooms were clean and adequate, we were in the cheaper rooms. We only used their booking service for a mini bus to the airport, it arrived on time and got us to our destination on time without using the aggressive driving techniques that is common in China.Various eating places nearby including a western one - McD. Nothing outstanding but nothing wrong. "
zhao an hotel ,"nice hotel The hotel is located ZaBei Area,only 2 Metro stations away from nan jing road, rooms is clean, the hotel offer free internet access &amp; breakfast, and chinese massage(health club) is very nice!shanghai is lovely! "
zhao an hotel ,"Perfect Hotel at a perfect price; Metro is just next door The Hotel is located north of the Suzhou Creek, only 2 Metro stations away from People's Square at the Metro Station Hanzhong Road (the entry to the Metro is just next door,... really amazing!)rooms are big, bathroom very clean (and you get one free Nestlé Mineral water every day), free internet access, delicate breakfast,... I don't find any point to criticize.Enjoy your trip to Shanghai! "
zhao an hotel ,"Good Hotel I stayed here for 4 nights as part of a Travelsphere Tour. The rooms are fine and there is nothing to worry about. There is a nice bar areaand the hotel is opposite a food store that sells english snacks if you arent keen on the chinese food. The hotel is next to a subway which is great to get from place to place. Also, I highly reccomend Travelsphere as all tours I have been on with them have been fantastic. "
zhao an hotel ,"Zhao An- a good 3 star hotel Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights on a college trip.i was surprised at how nice the rooms were. we had 2 people sharing to one room and we had a double bed each, which was lovely! it was extremly roomy with lots of space to move around in. there was lots of wardrobe space and the cleaners came every day. there was even a telephone next to the toilet in the bathroom- incase you cant make it back in time!the staff were not overly friendly at this hotel but this may have been because they couldnt speak english.the hotel had a lot of facilities but we were so busy that we didnt have time to use most of them. there was a swimming pool on the roof but this wasnt filled up. i doubt anyone would have wanted to use it anyway as it was only about 5 degrees during our stay. i think there was also a gym as well.the restaurant served ok-ish food. it depends on whether you mind trying new things. we only had breakfast there and they did have fry-ups. though this was 'chinese style.' i just had toast with jam every morning.on free evenings, i made the most of the room service. it wasnt overly expensive and was just like ordering a chinese take away! the sweet and sour pork was to die for- the best food i had all week! they bring your food right up to your room on a trolley and give you cutlery as well as chopsticks.the location of the hotel was excellent. it was next to a metro stattion, so you didnt have far to walk to get to places. there was also a shopping district up the road and we could see the pearl tv tower from our window! If traffic noise affects your sleep i wouldn't recommend this hotel, as it is on the corner of a 6-lane road, which was noisy, as the chinese seem to beep all the time! though this may depend on which side of the building your room is on.overall, i did enjoy my stay at this hotel. i think it was more of a 3.5- 4* hotel, rather than a 3*. "
zhao an hotel ,"3 star hotel It was what we expected from a 3-star hotel. The staf was friendly, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was good (lots of different food). The location was not good. "
zhao an hotel ,"Good value - great location over the metro We stayed here over a week. We thought it was good value. Very clean. More like 3 and half stars. The hotel sits right on top of the subway entrance which means everything is only a few minutes away by train - avoid peak hour! Some reception staff had good english, others were lacking, but all tried to be helpful. A lot of tour groups stayed here. The &quot;Steak King&quot; accross the road was good value for meals - but don't expect western style food. Nothing much else is nearby. The western breakfast was OK but the bacon was usually cold. The prices for taxis on their website were quite accurate- taxis are cheap in Shanghai, but get reception to write down your destnation in chinese, and carry a map of where the hotel is located - most taxi drivers hadn't heard of it! "
zhao an hotel ,"Not the best - needs work on staff and management This was the worst of five hotels we stayed at in China and Hong Kong on a pre-booked tour, so we didn't have any choice where we stayed. Had read the other reviews before we went and confirm that staff on the front desk were very surly and unco-operative ( anumber of our party had problems with being charged for water they had not had from the mini-bar,or were the hotel trying to charge for water bought outsideand brought in?), the bar service was either poor or non-existent (one night the bar was closed because they had set it up for a meeting the next day!), the pool was empty of water as they didn't fill it up until June, although it was already 80^ F at the end of April. In the dining room, they were unprepared for diners wanting a bottle of wine with their dinner - no choice, and confusion in the opening, and having to pay cash as it was delivered! The buffet dinner we has was the poorest quality we experienced in China, and the&quot;Western&quot; dinner which the tour operator had organised had to be seen to be believed (I blame the tour co).On the other hand, the rooms were very spacious and we found them quite clean. When we returned at the end of the tour for one night we were surpised to find ourselves in one of their duplexes, with a lovely spiral staircase leading from the downstairs lounge with TV to the upstairs bedroom with another TV and ensuite etc. The long curtains covering the double height windows by the staircase needed cleaning as did the windows, but overall we enjoyed that room. The only other problem with the rooms was that (and we were not alone in our party with this) the keycard locking system was difficult to operate and didn't work much of the time.There is a Metro station next door to the hotel, and its just off one of the very busy (and chaotic) main roads.As this hotel was included in the tour price, it is not possible for me to say whether or not it is value for money, but you would not want to pay too much to stay here. "
zhao an hotel ,"A little on the seedy side The Zhao An was the least expensive Shanghai hotel choice on my recent gotoday Beijing/Xian/Shanghai trip. The exterior looked promising, all mirrored glass and angles, but having to drag my bag up the steps into a very small lobby was the first bad sign. The lobby was packed with a group of schoolchildren and an Australian tour group. Checking in took a while and a key deposit was required but they did take Amex. There was a sign saying some guest rooms had high speed internet access at no charge and I requested one.Opening the door to my room was a let down. Seedy is the best word to describe it. The wall behind the luggage platform was very scuffed and the wardrobe was a dated pastel color. My room was one in from the corner and was somewhat oddly shaped, giving me a very large and modern bathroom, the cleanest I had found in China. I also had an alcove with a desk and the promised internet access with a cable. From peeking into other rooms mine was definitely not the norm. The low and firm two full size beds had comforters with covers that were changed daily (if the card was left on the bed) instead of blankets and top sheets. Two free mineral waters were replenished daily.The restaurant offered a buffet breakfast that was included in my package and the best thing about it was the chef who made fresh omelettes. However there were just eggs, no choice of fillings whatsoever. The rest of the buffet was just to satisfy hunger. We chose to eat in the hotel one night and they were out of practically everything. One by one we made our selections and each time the waitress came back and said they were out. She was very pleasant and recommended an excellent dish when I was out of things to order but it was an annoying experience. And the chef did send over a free vegetable dish to apologize.Location wise it seemed a distance away from what I wanted to see but cabs were very cheap. The gift area in the lobby did have the best looking 2008 Beijing Olympics T-shirt I had found anywhere and I'm only sorry I didn't get one for everybody as they all want mine.My friend used the pool but I wouldn't. The tiles had blackened grout and there was no chlorine smell.My friends had to stay an extra day because of booked flights and they were only charged the extra $35 USD group rate so I guess this is a fairly cheap hotel, especially for Shanghai. For the price I would have to say it's a good value but personally I would rather spend the extra money for a better room and location. My friends had already booked when I decided to join them but next time I'll stay away from cheap travel packages and go back to booking my own. "
zhao an hotel ,"A slightly-above-average 3* hotel with definite room for improvement in service We found the Zhao An to be a slightly-above-average 3* hotel that offers good value for money in Shanghai, which tends to have more expensive hotel rooms than many other Chinese cities. We had booked two Superior rooms, however upon arrival we were upgraded to suites since all of the Superior rooms were occupied. Extremely pleased with this upgrade - the suites were very clean, on two floors and one of them even had a kitchenette. The free ADSL broadband connection in the room generally worked well throughout our stay. Unfortunately can't comment on the other rooms at the hotel since we did not see them.Breakfast was rather disappointing though, and with hindsight we ought not to have bothered, and spent the RMB 40 per breakfast elsewhere. The quality of the buffet and presentation was poor, and the staff generally unhelpful and unfriendly. As breakfast items ran out, staff were often reluctant to provide more when requested. In addition, catering for vegetarians was not at all good.Service at front desk was also rather variable - some staff were efficient and friendly, whereas others did not seem to keen to provide good service - this is a shame. With a little extra training in customer service and improvements to the breakfast facilities, this could be an excellent 3* hotel. "
zhao an hotel ,"Disappointed I stay at this hotel because I read good reviews from a website. I am disappointed. First of all, I'm Asian (Thai) and do not speak of word of Chinese. When I checked in my room, I found out that the air-condition was not working at all. The room has only one window. And being on the 9th floor, it was very windy, plus the construction going on outside was noisy. So, I went down to the front desk and ask if they could get me a different room. This lady looked at me with an attitude, and said &quot;No more room&quot;, and walked away. She didn't even look at her computer or anything. As I stood there dumb founded, she came back with look of &quot;Why am I still there?&quot;. I asked her to get someone to fix the air-con, she said &quot;Okay&quot; and walked away again. I retreated back to my room and felt like being scolded by a school master. So, besides very little English, the front desk people have an attitude. Never once when I leave the hotel did anyone ever ask me if I need a taxi or help in anyway. While I have seen them asked to help any caucasian, and always with a great smile. One morning, I decided to try their breakfast at 40 Yuan. Arrived at the restaurant at 10:25am. Paid the money and got a seat. Coffee came with no spoon, no sugar and no cream. I usually have a cup or two before eating something. Anyway, as I was going to grab a few things to eat from the buffet table, I was told by a woman to please hurry as they are about to take the food away. They advertised that breakfast was from 7am to 11am, and it was only 10:32am. They should have told me this before I paid my money. I demanded for my money back, and left. The day I checked out, I paid 3135 Yuan for the room and phone calls. I stay 8 days. Then, the guy presented me with another bill (12 Yuan) for a missing hand towel. I tried to tell him that I did not take it. How can I prove that something was not missing? Well, I paid the 12 Yuan so I could just get out of that hotel. Again, with 2 luggages, no one helped me. Not all were bad of course, the room, bed, blanket, and towels were clean. The room got done twice daily. The bathroom was good. The maid were nice and friendly, unlike the front desk people. Two free bottles of water daily. However, the coffee in the room is 2 Yuan per package. Beware. "
